3290000 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3290001 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3290002 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3290003 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3290004 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3290005 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3290006 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3290007 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3290008 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3290009 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3290010 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3290011 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3290012 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3290013 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3290014 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3290015 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3290016 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3290017 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3290018 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3290019 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3290020 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3290021 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3290022 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3290023 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3290024 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3290025 most of the wage increases already took place in may wecan still expect some minor increases mainly in the internetdepartment but most of them are behind us
3290026 we think eventually the business will come back there areopportunities when the market is the way it is at the moment togrow our business although you wont meaningfully see theresult of that until the capital market opens again in somefuture period
3290027 the good news is that there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the wto members had agreed since last year that is end 2008
3290028 we are considering a way to better reflect these risingcosts in the prices of our next pcs
3290029 lifting prices as competitors prices are sliding could spurconsumers to move away from nec

3290044 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3290045 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3290046 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3290047 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3290048 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3290049 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3290089 you know you really have a very high opinion of yourself dont you
3290090 you say that if you dont cover yourself up from head to toe youre going to inadvertently seduce every man around you within a one mile radius now thats self confidence
3290091 let me tell you something you fat ugly bitch even if you took off all your clothes and walked naked down majeedhee magu the only effect you would have on any hot blooded man is utter revulsion or maybe someone will call a zoo to tell them that a pachyderm is on the loose on the streets of male what you need is not a black curtain to cover yourself but to go a diet and do some aerobics instead of stuffing your face then you probably might end up with something that actually requires covering up in order to keep the rabid men at bay seduce men with your sexual wiles indeed you wouldnt know a sexual wile if you ate it
3290092 it used to be in animation you just had unknown actors do the parts the idea of hiring a really good actor tom hanks for instance was a really revolutionary idea
3290093 partly they did it because they were great actors partly they did it cause they wanted to use them for publicity to be very honest with you i dont really think i need to hire a big movie star to publicize my movie i dont need angelina jolie here thats what it comes down to in the end they have two days in the studio and then they have like two weeks doing press they are mainly paid for the press stuff

3290102 we need to know whether we are still under moscows rule or whether we are protected by the west
3290103 were not sure anymore whether the west defends us russia feels like it can do whatever it wants we dont feel safe anymore
3290104 russia makes clear what the goal of this operation is
3290105 the goal of this operation is not only to annex part of georgian territory but the goal of this operation is the regime change in georgia the change of democratically elected government in georgia

3290159 russian jets have carried out strikes on military targets in the central georgian town of gori close to the breakaway region of south ossetia
3290160 georgian officials say 60 people were killed when bombs hit two blocks of flats in the town
3290161 the comments came after russian commanders announced they were sending more troops into south ossetia
3290162 after days of exchanging heavy fire with the russian backed separatists georgian forces launched a surprise attack on thursday night to regain control of the region which has had de facto independence since the end of a civil war in 1992
3290163 in response moscow sent armoured units across the border russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said about 1 500 people had been killed so far including 15 of his countrys soldiers
3290164 georgia said russia had also launched air strikes on targets inside its territory in what it described as
3290165 the uk the us and france are pinpointing what they say is russias aggression as the key factor in the slide towards war while moscow insists georgia is to blame

3290194 in fact no group of parents married single step or even empty nest reported significantly greater emotional well being than people who never had children its such a counterintuitive finding because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life and theyre not
3290195 if you admit that kids and parenthood arent making you happy its basically blasphemy

3290472 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3290473 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3290474 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3290475 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3290476 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3290477 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3290478 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3290479 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3290480 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3290481 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3290482 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3290483 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3290484 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3290485 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
3290486 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3290487 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3290488 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3290489 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3290490 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3290491 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
3290492 and to leave everyone else far behind when it comes to fundraising
3290493 now they feel that school is over all they want to do is watch tv or just lay back on the computer and eat
3290494 its like no school video game city its really very sad
3290495 you would think the summer would be a time when kids are really active and running around
3290496 for many kids its the opposite they have a lot of down time in the summer that theyre trying to fill
3290497 summer can be a very difficult time financially for families
3290498 so this is a particularly interesting time to be thinking about the influences of this summer on obesity and kids
3290499 we asked the question when it comes to childhood obesity are schools more part of the solution or more part of the problem
3290500 families have agendas that are related to vacation and traveling so its very difficult for the child to adhere to
3290501 and then theyre not on a good schedule at home because there are times when they are bored and they have more access to the refrigerator because the parent is at work
3290502 because it affects both ends of the energy balance equation
3290503 when children are watching television theyre not at the beach or playing basketball in the back yard burning off calories but also theyre receiving an unending series of messages by way of commercials to eat the highest calorie lowest quality food imaginable
3290504 a lot of the kids today dont have the basic fundamental games that we did
3290505 we are really going to feel the effects that technology is having on our children in 10 years and were all going to pay a steep cost
3290506 when theyre in school they have their breakfast their lunch
3290507 summertime brings the ice cream the smoothies all the tempting stuff this will help them resist that when theyre adults

3290518 je pense que le times comme le washington post usa today le wall street journal le los angeles times les grandes cha nes et les agences de presse ont t bien trop timides face ce sujet
3290519 le times ne voulait pas r gurgiter les articles de lenquirer sans les v rifier ce qui est une attitude responsable mais le times na pas essay de les v rifier au del de quelques tentatives ce en quoi il avait tort je pense

3290607 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3290608 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3290609 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3290610 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3290611 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3290612 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3290613 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3290624 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3290625 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3290626 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3290627 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3290628 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3290629 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3290630 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3290631 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3290632 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3290633 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3290634 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things
3290635 apparently it was an improvised explosive device that hit the bus
3290636 wanting people to listen you cant just tap them on the shoulder anymore
3290637 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3290638 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3290639 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3290640 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question
3290641 yes lets see a side by side comparison asap im a life long journalist and everything i write is 100 percent from my brain or attributed this piece i wrote while doing 200 or so interview s for the techcrunch50 event
3290642 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3290643 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3290644 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3290645 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3290646 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3290647 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3290648 if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3290649 a failure to sell the torrent entertainment network bittorrents attempt at an online media store to best buy for a rumored 15 million
3290650 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3290651 we found in talking to folks that at 2 500 its a considered purchase but its of value to them
3290652 its sturdy and solid but nimble like a bicycle and its a great alternative to getting in a car
3290653 theres no other electric bike today built from the ground up as a commuting solution
3290654 is the reaction when people see it and experience it when they ride it
3290655 we found in talking to folks that at 2 500 its a considered purchase but its of value to them
3290656 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3290657 it is a great way to fit into your favourite party dress as long as you dont mind violently shitting yourself the entire time youre at the party
3290658 drink one bottle a day for a week and watch the pounds literally fall out of you
3290659 if youve not lost at least half your body weight within seven days youll get your money back and a free bottle
3290660 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3290661 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3290662 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3290663 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3290664 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3290665 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3290666 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3290667 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3290668 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3290669 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3290670 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3290671 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3290672 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3290673 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3290674 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3290675 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3290676 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3290677 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3290678 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3290679 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3290680 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3290681 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3290682 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3290683 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3290684 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3290685 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3290686 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3290687 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3290688 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3290689 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3290690 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3290691 a style of computing where massively scalable it enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using internet technologies
3290692 as service provisions a critical aspect of cloud computing grow vendors must become or partner with service providers to deliver their technologies indirectly to users
3290693 user organisations will watch portfolios of owned technologies decline as service portfolios grow the key activity will be to determine which cloud services will be viable and when

3290700 i cant believe theyd be that stupid to try and dust off a statute its sort of like trying to prosecute people for adultery or something
3290701 its been fully litigated and they cant do it thats all there is
3290702 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3290703 this is not something we take likely but given the incident of this weekend we need to take firm action and this is the kind of action thats required in order to ensure the safety of our residents
3290704 but this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
3290705 the victim in the present case was a foreigner lady who was totally dependent on the hospitality provided to her by our people
3290706 in our case the victim was of such an age that she should have been seen by the convicts as a motherly figure
3290707 doing the right thing will not kill you will not destroy your friends a lot of popular culture insists on sort of a pornography of despair
3290708 my profound belief is that we need to give people sense of vision and possibility they no longer can imagine what a better future might look like and while the news media necessarily surfaces all the problems we face it has been the realm of the arts and sciences that have given us a sense of what could be
3290709 hes taking a bubble bath hes taking a bubble bath come quick hes taking a bubble bath
3290710 it wouldve been funnier if you left the mask on
3290711 doing the right thing will not kill you will not destroy your friends a lot of popular culture insists on sort of a pornography of despair

3290716 slavery was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution
3290717 this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
3290718 arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction
3290719 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

3290743 i wouldnt rule out going into politics when i retire from football
3290744 i was talking to charles and thought how i agree with his policies
3290745 but in regards to a 24 hour active role that is a long way off
3290746 in politics i think you would be walking on eggshells more than footy players it would be a tough gig
3290747 but im still unsure what i am going to do after football so i am keeping my options open
3290748 craig will be on our ticket when we run in the state government elections in 2011
3290749 craig is the man to keep our kids in a straight line they would look up to him
3290750 he would be the one to get our kids playing sport which would keep them off the street and away from crime
3290751 i have no doubt craig is the right man to speak with the kids
3290752 craig is against parking meters we are trying to prevent them being installed in randwick
3290753 it is great to see a local kid who is now a local hero like craig getting involved in wanting to make a difference

3290759 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3290760 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes
3290761 thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3290762 there are some pikeys there at turn 10 putting tarmac down what do you think of that

3290785 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3290844 whatever cards are dealt ill have to play with them
3290845 but it all worked out i got my degree and im here

3290849 both of them told me how hard it was to cut him because of how much integrity they felt he had
3290850 that meant more to me than any of the super bowl rings he has
3290851 if he had told me he wanted me to play safety or something i might have been upset but when he told me he wanted to go back to d line it wasnt a big deal
3290852 of course i wanted to see how the fullback experiment would have went but thats coach reids call
3290853 i havent seen enough fullback play to know how i was doing coach reid has seen a lot more than me he had a feel that maybe this wasnt going to be the right spot and i respect that
3290854 he was disappointed but danny is the kind of guy who tends to ask me what i think of stuff
3290855 i told him that he might have the quickness that defensive coordinator jim johnson is looking for i told him this is a team where you can really fit in he tends to take my opinion and run with it i know he really wanted to try the experiment and then all of a sudden bam its gone but he knew he couldnt be disappointed too long
3290856 im not everybodys cup of tea in the nfl but hopefully when i get on the field i can show them differently
3290857 i know im not the biggest guy down there but im a little quicker i feel i use my hands well
3290858 hes done a good job hes going to play a lot more thursday night but hes done a good job
3290859 my first two seasons in new england we won 28 games lost four and won two super bowls
3290860 coming from temple where you didnt win much of all and going to a team where all of sudden youre setting a record by winning 21 straight games thats pretty crazy it doesnt get much better than that
3290861 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3290862 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3290863 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3290864 i cant remember the last time i played that much it felt good to get out there and banging heads with people and playing with the guys
3290865 ive said it before i think this is a big year for mac
3290866 at the least i saw a guy who was getting upfield and getting after the passer
3290867 hes kind of climbed the ladder and then he had a setback
3290868 that happens hes come out and hes played well hes put all that behind him he feels good and he seems to be playing productive football
3290869 first of all you just want to get them out there working
3290870 he hasnt played yet hopefully hes going to be ready to go thursday night were going to play him quite a bit hes just got to get used to that playing speed with us and getting used to the defense
3290871 hes going to go against a couple of good receivers this week hell be up to the task he just needs to make sure hes comfortable with the defense
3290872 it couldve been great in his situation hes finally maturing at age 35 sometimes its you sometimes its me he thought for so long it was someone else but at some point maybe it dawns on you that its not everyone elses fault

3290880 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3290881 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3290882 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3290883 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3290884 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3290885 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3290886 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3290887 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3290888 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3290889 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3290890 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3290891 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3290892 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3290893 two more days of racing and hopefully the medal race if everything goes well i feel fine with the position im in
3290894 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3290895 it was the first time they werent doubling the post
3290896 anyone on this team could do it any given night
3290897 i dont feel the defeat today brings too much pressure
3290898 watching the game from the stands sunday really motivated us
3290899 seeing lebron james block a shot with two hands off the backboard and just the way they were playing defense got us ready everyone came into this game knowing the crowd could be a factor
3290900 its up to them right now if they dont call down to the bullpen they dont call down but im ready
3290901 hes just now getting back to where he should be really
3290902 that hes sore every now and then goes back to the fact that he threw 120 pitches and hes only used to throwing around 30
3290903 before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other three days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover
3290904 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3290905 its better every time we see him theres a huge ceiling for him the father has been a professional player and theres a lot of good things there
3290906 its unfortunate and frustrating snakebittens probably the best phrase you could use
3290907 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3290908 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3290909 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3290910 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3290911 ive never been the guy to put on a certain image just because i run the 100 meter dash
3290912 basically im the same person on and off the track i just get a little more intense when the gun is shot
3290913 i said mom kobe bryant asked about my leg she was shocked as well it was amazing
3290914 id rather be 100 percent going into the olympics than 85 percent with some races under my belt
3290915 i had a good chance in practice to see where im at and that kind of gave me a confidence boost
3290916 i definitely understand that suspicion comes with the territory because past champions have tested positive
3290917 thats why the olympic champion must go out and prove himself as clean
3290918 im staying hydrated and taking care of my body so im really confident that its going to hold up
3290919 i dont know how hes thinking but id assume its a lot of pressure hes under regardless of what anyone says
3290920 a jamaican guy came up to me in the cafeteria yesterday and said i hope you dont break up our 1 2 sweep im sure theyre hearing the same from their coach
3290921 but i would have to look at that after i won the gold medal this is one of the hottest 100 meter races ever in history
3290922 there are three guys who have run 9 7 two more guys 9 8 its amazing asafa is looking good and usain bolt is looking great as well i havent been on the track since the trials so im kind off in the background
3290923 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3290924 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3290925 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3290926 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3290927 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3290928 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3290929 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3290930 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3290931 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were
3290932 gruzi skie wojska musz znikn ze wszystkich punkt w z kt rych rozpoczynano operacje przeciw osetii lub z kt rych operacje te by y wspierane
3290933 mimo wcze niejszych deklaracji nie zdo a y zapobiec wybuchowi konfliktu w regionie
3290934 hes one of the easiest guys ive ever known to get along with
3290935 nba commissioner david stern has told those associated with the cubs that cuban is one of the nbas best partners
3290936 and everyone appreciates that cuban understands fans and marketing and is one of the creative pioneers of the world of new media and would create a tremendous buzz throughout baseball that would be nothing but beneficial to the industry
3290937 so he might yell at umpire joe west george steinbrenner did a lot worse to umpires and what steinbrenner did for baseball because of how he grew the yankees will put him in cooperstown and put a lot of money in other owners pockets
3290938 fast eyes moving all the time that means a quick thinker
3290939 when we first went over to china for one international trip every four years we actually played against the shanghai sports school
3290940 i watched him train his team the one thing he definitely brings as an assistant i dont have to explain to him how you train a setter or outside hitter
3290941 if theyre absolute top tier theyre not even going to get a passport
3290942 if theyre at that level their best options are right there
3290943 their sophistication in the sport is usually at a higher level because theyre kind of on that sports track
3290944 theyve shown some promise in sports and theyve been groomed to excel athletically others are groomed to be a musician or an artist others who have shown great promise in math they are groomed in that area
3290945 if you have shown some promise or have bloodlines youll be pushed that way
3290946 in china we spent a lot of time on building skills
3290947 they learn technique for three years before they can actually compete
3290948 we had somebody from a smaller area in china they were denied a visa by the united states shanghai is easier beijing a little more difficult beijing has so many high profile people in various fields that the visa allotment gets used up a place like shanghai it seems like it functions like any other western city capitalism is ok there
3290949 two more are in graduate school and working one for sure intends to go back once she gets her graduate degree
3290950 one of the biggest problems at every university for example is drinking for undergraduates
3290951 drinking is just not a big deal they could have done it at any time thats not a big part of their lifestyle they seem to be more balanced they want to go out and see a movie or go dancing occasionally but it doesnt consume their life theyre here to serve a purpose not looking to get away from mom and dad and go crazy
3290952 the international connection has helped our program really attracting higher talented individuals
3290953 it would be difficult to attract that same level of talent in the united states theres just more competition for those players this was an avenue that fit for our university and our city we have such a melting pot
3290954 in china a lot of players go to sports schools
3290955 so we focus a lot on whichever sport we practice the coaches are very intense in china they dont give us many breaks we have to obey the coach or else we will get in trouble we only focus on one skill at a time so we can master that skill
3290956 i wish i could be there but i will be in preseason
3290957 there are a lot more people in shanghai philadelphia is more dangerous than shanghai the stores are always open late at night in shanghai so people stay out later and it is much safer
3290958 we dont do shuffle steps or anything like in america we cross over our feet because its faster
3290959 they have very good schools in shanghai just like ivy schools
3290960 but the education is better here in the united states the education in china focuses on books and themes here they focus on working abilities
3290961 you even have recruiting services that are basically scouting and giving out names on the international athletes including in china
3290962 meine tochter war ein opfer genau wie mein enkel sie hatte berhaupt keine kontrolle ber die situation
3290963 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3290964 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3290965 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3290966 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3290967 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3290968 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3290969 not at the point where they want to discuss the specific nature of the injuries
3290970 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3290971 i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support
3290972 there are some good things too i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3290973 we had a blitz on and i think he just underestimated holmes speed and wasnt quite in a good position to make the tackle
3290974 we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now
3290975 just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3290976 la banca por internet permite a las entidades un ahorro econ mico muy significativo
3290977 s lo invierten en su propia seguridad inform tica y no en la de sus clientes
3290978 no parece equitativo ni proporcionado que las entidades eludan sin m s su responsabilidad dirigiendo a sus clientes a los tribunales de justicia y haciendo recaer en los mismos la totalidad de los importes defraudados
3290979 we didnt play the way we wanted to in those friendlies
3290980 im confident our team started to get a little more confident after several rotations and started having more fun it was a great time
3290981 i can change things last second i can tell him personnel are coming onto the field i can tell him down and distance youd have to talk to him but i think he likes it
3290982 ironing some kinks out we ended up changing the headset jim was using went from wired to wireless i could hear better on the wireless the wired set was picking up a lot more crowd noise
3290983 with the hand signals the corners can kind of stay out away from the huddle which cuts down on their running time just a little
3290984 now they have to come in the huddle so its going to be a little adjustment period for those guys
3290985 im happy with him i think we had maybe just one mistake as far as when he was playing in there but he did a pretty good job overall
3290986 legs werent the most fresh but i felt pretty good
3290987 first of all you just want to get them out there working
3290988 he needs to play a little he hasnt played yet hopefully hes going to be ready to go thursday night were going to play him quite a bit hes just got to get used to that playing speed with us and get used to the defense thats the main thing
3290989 id probably put him at 90 to 95 percent well have to see how tired he gets because thats what you worry about with the hamstring if he gets tired thats when you have to worry about a pull
3290990 the ioc means business in stamping out those who are not playing by the rules
3290991 we are going to hunt down the shameless people who are causing harm to the health of our athletes
3290992 we will look to apply the maximum law to totally clamp down on drug taking in sport we will go to the courts because we want to jail all the cheats
3290993 anytime you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3290994 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown
3290995 and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support there are some good things too i take the good with the bad with that i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3290996 i think we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3290997 we extended a little bit more than what we anticipated
3290998 but after observing him down in the bullpen today it was well worth it
3290999 i was unsure about signing and the money wasnt there
3291000 cole gave me a call and we talked about it
3291001 i guess he sent his son over here for me to mess up
3291002 i felt strong so its up to them right now im going to be ready to throw if they dont call down they dont call down but im ready
3291003 put it this way before the all star game it was feeling a little maybe like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis in there not bad
3291004 if i would have just thrown regular at the all star game it probably would have gone away because i had the other 3 days off over the break but that didnt allow it to recover it didnt help it at all i dont want to say the all star game caused it to be bad but obviously it didnt help it
3291005 they are using half people karolyi said after the tiny chinese womens team grabbed a significant lead over the americans in team competition sunday night
3291006 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
3291007 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like he said
3291008 you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
3291009 they understood it a 10 is perfect that is good for the sport what is this system they say it cannot be manipulated it can be manipulated
3291010 i couldnt ask for anything else so far phelps said
3291011 weve done everything weve wanted to do im very happy with how things have gone so far
3291012 to be tied with all those names from olympic history
3291013 its definitely an honor ive been able to spend some time with carl lewis and had some words with spitz here and there its pretty amazing
3291014 i wanted to try and get out into open water i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i knew tae hwan park of korea was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3291015 on my scouting trips i used to be amazed there would be kids at 11 a m in the morning playing baseball many of them didnt go to school
3291016 they have a great deal of passion for baseball they love it they play it they know its history
3291017 when i was active in baseball we had a few latins here and there
3291018 now theyve pretty much taken charge but only because they can play thats the bottom line they can play
3291019 there are many great players from my country now as time goes by there will only be more
3291020 i was working in a factory that made jeans and we had a baseball team that played on weekends
3291021 this was around 1979 i was 18 and with the money i made at the factory i bought a motorcycle i was riding that motorcycle when my sister found me and said there was a scout waiting for me at my moms house
3291022 i didnt think she knew anything about baseball let alone scouts so i wasnt going to go
3291023 there were a lot of guys in the past who just got too old because nobody saw them they were good players who didnt make it because nobody saw them play now its easier because every team is down there if youre good somebody is going to know that
3291024 its much more in depth and sophisticated now than when i first started
3291025 there were a few organizations that were aggressive in the dominican or venezuela but now we have a scouting network in each one of the countries and its not only us but nearly every club in baseball
3291026 for a guy that really played with a lot of pain and injury he did a good job johnson said
3291027 im happy with him happy with his progress he just needs to play more
3291028 im a little banged up small injuries here and there laws said
3291029 i felt i did pretty good i made some decent plays tons to work on a lot of good film to study
3291030 im thrilled to be part of the flyers family again
3291031 i want to make the fan know what the players are thinking and what the coach is saying in different situations its a new challenge and im really looking forward to it
3291032 i understand it was that way in the locker room when he played and you can see it in the way he interacts with the fans he has a personality that makes you feel comfortable
3291033 we both thought it was time to go in different directions
3291034 still be an active member of the flyers family in his role with the alumni and their functions
3291035 he was one of the good ones who came out of here
3291036 its a very proud feeling knowing that someone from here is coming home with the gold it was overwhelming to actually see it
3291037 even if no else was there hed be in there practicing
3291038 watching how passionate he was about it got me into swimming he was a great role model always trying to help someone out
3291039 jumping up and down screaming and crying at the same time
3291040 for people to see someone of color who can stand out in a nontraditional area in a role that is positive is tremendous
3291041 this is a fantastic opportunity for me and im really looking forward to working alongside tim saunders and with the team
3291042 he knows the game and he can communicate the rhythm and timing on broadcasts will come in time
3291043 though performance gains are less dramatic as resolutions drop to 1 600 x 1 200 not that any self respecting gamer would push so few pixels
3291044 but after about five years of experience i can say that it has become much easier and more exciting

3291100 it hurts i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3291101 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3291102 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3291103 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3291104 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3291105 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3291106 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
3291107 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3291108 i love them both but they want to see what their value is
3291109 most times guys choose to be free agents though its tough to get them back
3291110 the date aug 10 was right up on us i really hope in my heart to be back i really want to be in philadelphia
3291111 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3291112 we were in the gym and i asked him if i could take a picture with him
3291113 he said hows your leg you are in my heart i hope everythings coming on i texted my mother and told her she was shocked
3291114 ive been looking for an indicator to let me know where im going to be at and i think sundays workout let me know
3291115 i just felt like a kid in a candy store
3291116 this is the beginning its all coming true it feels very good inside
3291117 once i got to athens and i was watching that meet take place it sank in how difficult it is to come so close to be given a free ticket to the olympic games as an athlete and then have to watch it
3291118 that is a very tough emotion to swallow but i had to put my personal ambition aside for the team its a selfless position to be an alternate i couldnt have been happier for those guys when they garnered that medal in a way we were all part of that every gymnast back home was a part of that team usa goes a lot deeper than just the six guys here
3291119 you have to dig to the center of your heart
3291120 i said there was no extrinsic award that was going to take away my sense of inner accomplishment and that is true
3291121 but i found out as the days progressed that living those words is actually a challenge ill be the first to tell you its no easy task i had to continuously dig down deep and reach into the toolbox at times and pull out the proper tool in order to keep me going and keep me motivated

3291135 affirmative action is something the good dont need and the bad dont deserve
3291136 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
3291137 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
3291138 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
3291139 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly
3291140 attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference
3291141 dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams
3291142 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence
3291143 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
3291144 for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing
3291145 war begins in the minds of men and it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must first be constructed
3291146 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death
3291147 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
3291148 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
3291149 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
3291150 democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve
3291151 if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all
3291152 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3291153 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
3291154 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
3291155 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3291156 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3291157 weve had 35 new competitors coming out of china in the last 18 months
3291158 een scheidsrechter behoort altijd een voorbeeld van onberispelijkheid te zijn ik ben er van overtuigd dat van hulten de woorden vuile tyfushond heeft gebruikt dat past een arbiter niet

3291161 fancy drop down menus and fast moving flash graphics are great for catching the users eye but when you want to get down to business make sure your site presents an easy navigation menu and map this will allow most las vegas nevada politics users to get what they are after and at the same time be wowed by your graphical presentations
3291162 succesful las vegas nevada politics marketing takes time and money
3291163 and the old adage you have to spend money to make money applies dont go cheap on your websites checkout process or navigational menus instead save money by using simple content generation software and ready made blog software these steps will ensure quality at the right price
3291164 it takes a discplined and creative approach to get your message across
3291165 and some times a little luck and good old fashioned word of mouth advertising
3291166 the thank you page can also remind the customer of other merchandise service offers on your website which might create another sales opportunity remember not to go overboard just give them 3 or 4 other offers or coupons or else they may get confused and not ever return again
3291167 we spend a lot time working with our designers on the homepage
3291168 and once the home page is solid we use it as a template to create other pages on the website consistency and easy of use are absolutely paramount especially in our las vegas nevada politics industry
3291169 be 100 certain that your shopping cart and check out process are super easy to use
3291170 or else confused customers will simply bail out and not complete their purchase
3291171 contributed to the circumstances that gave rise to the injury
3291172 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3291173 its appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3291174 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption
3291175 residents will decide the future of the western extension and if local opinion is replicated across london this will signal the end for this failed experiment
3291176 beckton district park and forest lane park are very popular and are visited a lot by residents especially at this time of year we are very fortunate to have the lakes in the parks which are a haven for wildlife and a place of tranquillity
3291177 no sooner are the life belts replaced they are vandalised soon afterwards the foolish actions by these uncaring individuals are endangering the lives of people
3291178 i find it extremely hard to believe why anyone would act so irresponsibly these life belts are there to help anyone whose lives may depend upon them
3291179 against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
3291180 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3291181 i just went up there wanting to put the ball in play
3291182 i made good contact and the ball just took off you dont go up there looking for home runs but when they help the team win its a good feeling
3291183 s perdere ci che pi desideri tragico ma realizzarlo beh credo che quello sia il massimo che si possa sperare
3291184 weve slowly moved away from check processing to credit card sales
3291185 mostly because check processing takes days and credit cards are almost instant further if the check bounces and weve sold a middle eastern gaming policy product it can take a month to track down the delinquent account holder and get our money back with credit cards its up to the respective bank to come up with the money
3291186 im excited to be starting up this new e wallet
3291187 because weve noted a huge demand for middle eastern gaming policy transactions online in order to meet this demand were going to need high end it and fresh programming platforms with these two elements teamed together we believe we can provide payment solutions for middle eastern gaming policy companies and many others
3291188 e business by 2014 believes that eventually there will be a form of
3291189 movement towards a personal cash card not credit card is starting to begin when that day arrives payment processing for those looking to buy middle eastern gaming policy stuff will be extremely easy reliable and very fast
3291190 i love shopping for middle eastern gaming policy stuff online
3291191 because i have a student credit card that allows me to make internet purchases without it id be paying double or triple for my books at the school bookstore whereas online i can find books second hand for a third of the price
3291192 older folks are skeptical of making purchases online fearing identity theft or unscrupulous retailers
3291193 but when they see others buying things with no problems they quickly opt to try it the newfangled way online
3291194 weve got three players all vying for the same market search buy and process google and microsoft have the software and search technology while paypal boasts the most friendly payment processing online all the same google would probably prefer to vertically consolidate this process under their control while hopefully avoiding anti trust and or monopoly issues
3291195 essentially we want fast processing but also very secure processing customer confidence is extremely important in the middle eastern gaming policy industry and we aim to be one of the top businesses in this market in order to do that business transactions must be clean

3291209 in the summer the season seems so far away and now on the very first day it seems so short that first game its going to be here in just a minute and you have so much to do
3291210 theres a huge change mentally for the coaches and the players once you get to this first day
3291211 you can see it in the kids you can see the change in the summer its a little more relaxed more leisurely paced but this morning it took about two minutes and you can see the change
3291212 girls have to actually get out of bed earlier than they have been for the last 10 weeks
3291213 but once the girls are in theyre going and they realize the summer is over and were off and running
3291214 ive been running over the summer because it makes it a lot easier when you show up for this first day if you are in a little bit of shape
3291215 its probably the last year im ever going to play football so this year i was actually looking forward to the first day of practice
3291216 its great to have the community foundation jump in and help us
3291217 its not that the mens club doesnt provide a great service its such an important part of our community
3291218 i didnt know what to do its been three years since ive had an at bat
3291219 honestly i was just swinging and hoping i hit the ball i got lucky
3291220 we were just rewarding some of the guys for being here 60 plus games
3291221 its a long summer for everybody just letting the guys have some fun
3291222 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3291223 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3291224 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3291225 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3291226 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3291227 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3291228 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3291229 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3291230 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3291231 if hes found out he doesnt like it well thats the only role we have for him at this time
3291232 he has not shown from a health perspective that hes been able to play every day in the outfield he just has to perform the task thats asked of him
3291233 but what i have seen on this computer is some of the very worst i have ever seen
3291234 it involves very young children but so far it is nothing he produced
3291235 it may be an innocent thing to put up pictures for family but they may not be the only ones seeing them
3291236 we need to stand up to the oil companies and tell them to drill or get off the pot and do it in a way that allows us to move toward a renewable energy future
3291237 as ive consistently said drilling alone is not the answer but while it is a part of the current system we should make sure its done responsibly and that consumers and taxpayers benefit not just the oil companies
3291238 does not increase american energy production and will do nothing to bring down prices at the pump
3291239 i support an all of the above energy plan that includes more oil exploration more wind and solar power more refineries and nuclear power and more conservation
3291240 mark schauers proposed 200 percent increase in the michigan oil drilling fee and his opposition to drilling for more oil in the gulf of mexico demonstrates again he opposes more american energy production
3291241 we did a lot of due diligence in seeking out the best place for the knights to play and without question the pbl offers the greatest opportunities for our organization from a business standpoint and from an entertainment standpoint
3291242 and are impressed with their vision to continue to grow their basketball organization battle creek is a terrific market and the kellogg arena which seats 4 700 for basketball is a perfect venue for pbl games
3291243 once the season was over we were investigating what was going on in minor league basketball
3291244 its not that the ibl was a bad choice because it was a great league for us to be in but the pbl seems to be ahead of the other minor leagues already even in their second year
3291245 this league starts in january were hoping that playing in the winter when you normally have high school and college basketball our fans will be more used to going to basketball games
3291246 overall we have heard nothing but high praise about the professionality of the pbl and how they want to bring their league to a higher standard and we want to be a part of that
3291247 lenovo make hulk angry battery life suck hulk smash netbook
3291248 weve created a business model that works it stimulates economic activity and encourages foreign investment our filmmakers rely heavily on exports and its this international revenue stream that allows them to keep telling canadian stories
3291249 in our view these are important programs and cutting them doesnt make any sense it cant be a budget issue they federal government send people on junkets all the time
3291250 this is truly an outrageous decision on the part of the federal government
3291251 this is going to really erode the ability of artists to get their work on the international stage
3291252 you thought it was a picture of god as i believe did shaw
3291253 in the middle of the season when the ratings dipped a little before they went back up i think that maybe we lost some people
3291254 there were some episodes that were very heavy mythology episodes and very heavily serialized i would say that these episodes this year are a little bit more self contained than our episodes were last year
3291255 people seemed to make terrible comments i have gigantic biceps this season
3291256 what i can tell you is that both the show and the movie take certain inspiration from the terminator mythology and certain themes you know that are important like the value of self sacrifice and perseverance and faith
3291257 but when we in the premiere of our show deposited sarah connor in the present day we instantly created a new timeline in the mythology so in that way you know the experience that our audience has watching sarah connor can only be seen on the television show
3291258 you have to look at things differently when youre on a series like this
3291259 we are very guarded about what we do on the show
3291260 the actors dont even know what were doing until they get their scripts
3291261 people always choose to say something to me when im at the pharmacy the produce section or the airport
3291262 and so im like im sorry im just a regular girl
3291263 i always feel like im disappointing in real life reaching for the celery but i am surprised and thrilled with how many people are watching our show i cannot say how proud i am people are seeing the show and really excited about it its been nice
3291264 im playing music most of the time i dont mean to be unkind to the people ive worked with in the movie business but it wouldnt kill me if i never did another film ive found my way back to music and this stuff is real close to my soul this is the happiest place ive been in my whole life
3291265 from the very start out here in los angeles ive always had at least a couple of people backing me up theres always been some kind of a band im a terrible guitar player and not much of a singer so i always figured i needed help onstage
3291266 after i got past the terror i enjoyed the freedom of being able to make mistakes without causing a train wreck
3291267 im kind of surprised other songwriters dont do it neil young and bob dylan for instance id love to see them play solo
3291268 im following johnny cashs example i have so many songs that people know and want to hear i know i can work in music as much as i want making films youre always waiting to be asked
3291269 and i never get tired of these songs every night all the feeling the people the circumstances that made them happen i feel it all and i still get to voice my opinion about whats going on in the world
3291270 i guess were all exposed to the same information these days so its easier to get on the same page
3291271 freedoms just another word when theres nothing left to eat
3291272 but as soon as my kids get home from school ill get them to find it on the internet
3291273 when it comes to computers im completely illiterate a genuine geezer

3291484 it is this fundamental philosophical and moral divide between the classical liberal views i espouse and the anti liberal views of the putinists that explains my intense antipathy for the current russian government and state and which is the wellspring of my trenchant criticism it is not a divide that can be bridged as these are antithetical conceptions of the roles of the individual and the state
3291485 i will answer the question i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul a man deeply committed to his country and the best interests of his country and i appreciated so very much the frank dialogue
3291486 classical liberal beliefs that put the highest value on human freedom and which emphasize the essential importance of the rule of law equality before the law free markets and contract and limited government as the essential means for guaranteeing liberty

3291490 if were going to try and compete even at premier league level let alone europe we need a decent squad so we need to keep adding quality if we can
3291491 weve lost freddie bouma and we were quite thin on the ground before that that sort of injury can happen at any given minute therefore we need to try and safeguard as much as we can
3291492 what weve done is bring in a recognised right back and a recognised left back to help us we didnt have the right back last year but it wasnt for lack of trying
3291493 weve not finished well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3291494 last season we were exceptionally lucky with injuries eight or nine players played over 30 games and we didnt have big runs in the fa or league cup therefore we were able to concentrate on the league
3291495 but i cannot leave on bad terms despite the lure of the premier league i am caught in the middle
3291496 it is not easy when everyone has been so kind to you
3291497 i thought they were very generous to the chinese you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field
3291498 joe didnt box the best ive seen him but the scoring makes a difference and the tactics had to be changed because of the scoring everything the chinese guy touched they pressed the button for him
3291499 two people cant hold or there would be no fight
3291500 he has to pick one or the other he picked the chinese kid but because it was in his back yard had to take two points off me as well
3291501 i know a lot of players who smoke it is part of life when i was a player a lot of my friends and team mates smoked it depends if he smokes five cigarettes or 20 cigarettes
3291502 he has played regularly at the top level for eight seasons and im sure that his style of play will be a big plus for us and he will be a big favourite with the fans
3291503 he is a good character and a really creative strong running back rower with plenty of pace a good step and he is a proven line breaker
3291504 and although we are bringing him in as a back rower dean has also played at centre or five eighth so he offers us some additional versatility in other positions
3291505 i have had contacts with representatives of those two clubs
3291506 they asked monaco about my situation and about the chance of transferring me so there is a possibility that an official offer could be made in the coming days
3291507 i always played very well against sevilla and i created some goals
3291508 this should have left juande with a good impression and now my name is on their list of signings
3291509 roma played a friendly against monaco here in the principality and that is when the first contact was
3291510 its time to put a stop to all the crime you cant sleep at night because people are shooting and you want to know where the bullet is going to go next
3291511 to curtail some of the general mayhem weve been experiencing particularly the gun shots
3291512 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
3291513 they know exactly whos doing the shooting the robbery but it seems like were never going to get any justice around here
3291514 we got kids down here they should lock up these young folks that have been doing the shooting dont put us hostage or on lockdown
3291515 weve taken some drugs off people a couple of guns off people
3291516 imposing house arrest and suspending the fourth amendment for law abiding people is only going to cause more problems for this city
3291517 they need to work with the community to get this resolved instead of treating all of their citizens like criminals

3291536 i am thrilled with the new dependency report page as dependency management is always a struggle this is a terrific example of the new custom reporting capability because its useful today and gives us plenty of code to look at related to creating the look and feel of our own custom views
3291537 but i think well be happier once canada has a medal
3291538 if anything it promotes it and sends people to their tv sets
3291539 shes had better outings and she would probably admit that but the thing is you give her the ball because shes been here and shes done that
3291540 and she knows maybe how to pitch when all the cylinders arent firing
3291541 its a long tournament so i think everybodys going to touch the ball but shes the veteran so shes going to get it
3291542 that helps a lot especially when youre trying to work through some stuff
3291543 it allows you to just completely relax and focus on what you need to do without the pressure when one run might mean a ball game that wasnt the case today
3291544 that was huge the fact that we came out in the second inning and scored a couple of runs was amazing
3291545 it allowed me to fight through what i was fighting through and allowed me to rely on my defence

3291552 continue de suivre avec attention les all gations de crimes commis depuis la fin de 2005
3291553 everybody expects there to be a dropoff so i could just take that route and say
3291554 or i could go out there and perform and make plays consistently and theyll say
3291555 my goal is to win an sec championship above and beyond anything else
3291556 if we do that winning a national championship and everything will take care of itself
3291557 were just focused on the sec that is my goal as a quarterback to lead the team to the sec title
3291558 we just recruited two pretty outstanding guys that moved in front of them
3291559 we always say in recruiting our goal is to get better players than we have right now thats our goal every year to get better players
3291560 we made some really good plays out there today mike mccoy made two or three really big plays he had some big catches he caught the ball and ran with it and scored julio made a couple of big plays and scored
3291561 again im looking for more out of this football team we have some ability we are fast but i still think its just a gut feeling that weve got to push a little harder with this group i think every teams different but were going to demand more out of this group and i expect to get it and im going to find out whos willing to give it
3291562 he was looking like a million dollars for the first few days of practice
3291563 and the next thing you know the foot flared up on him he thought it was a bruise but then you do an x ray and theres a little crack in there
3291564 his numbers were good but you dont want to keep saying but you dont want to make that one throw in this league when everything is even there are just a few plays and a few players in a game that makes a difference we cannot give the ball up
3291565 the spring game is a perfect example he had a great scrimmage and then there late he forced the ball
3291566 hes getting there its a work in progress hes serious about doing well hell get there i know hell get there you want to learn the hard lessons in scrimmages you dont want to learn them in a big game
3291567 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3291568 some 20 years ago when i was crazy for this girl my position in office became shaky and my friends began to shun me simply because they know my wife personally and do not want to be dragged into a domestic affair
3291569 things between the girl and i were getting real hot and we were seriously thinking of eloping at the same time a pious man was invited to the surau for a series of ceramah the man was soft spoken with a radiant face and a smile that would always put me at ease
3291570 about 2 weeks or so before the girl and i were to elope the old man mentioned about polygamy and the responsibilities of a husband to his family though most of the matter touched i have already known what he mentioned towards the end had me thinking and doing it exactly i went home late at night when my family were already asleep then i crept into the children bedroom and looked at their faces and thinking how their lives would be messed up on the accounts of my lust next i went to my wife and did the same thinking how her life would be crushed she has been a loving and loyal wife why would i need to put her through a period of turmoil with that i scuttled my plans and have remain faithful ever since
3291571 online gestellt und ich denke es wird zeit f r eine auswertung
3291572 they havent told me anything i used to kind of worry about it but i just cant worry about that any more ive just got to come out and get better every day and compete i cant worry about when the timetables going to be

3291574 ok deh bli atur ajalah hahahaha tapi bener juga ya para full time blogger apa kabarnya
3291575 i just wanted to get strong enough to compete in this event
3291576 the first year i came second and i thought i can win this
3291577 you injure them sometimes said witzu who weighed in at 200 pounds
3291578 there is no intention to move to bmo field there is no intention to change our jerseys from double blue to any other colour there are no pretensions in this survey
3291579 the reason you send out this kind of survey is to listen not to predict but to listen and to be honest with what the numbers say
3291580 weve made our plans to be in the rogers centre thats what our five year plan states thats what our plan is
3291581 there is no other facility that accommodates us at this point so its not even reasonable to think any other way at this point if the survey came back overwhelming in favour of moving we would then need to take a more serious look at what that means there is no plan at this point
3291582 well wait to see what the fans say our five year plan is based on the argonauts being in the rogers centre but we will listen we sent it out for a reason and we will listen to the fans and see what they come back with in terms of the total fan experience and what is best for us in terms of moving forward bmo is a part of it but certainly only a part of that survey
3291583 hes a good kid ive had him around for a long time you certainly always try to keep your best players but he hasnt played in what two months or so so im not sure how much he could do here for the next month and a half for us
3291584 i dont think he wanted to be released i think hed rather have come up and played every day but with the way that adam lind has played in left field we just cant give him that opportunity
3291585 knowing that he wasnt going to get a chance to play every day he just said that hes probably just better off to be released at this point
3291586 i guess he could dh here and there a little bit
3291587 but weve also got kevin mench here whos done pretty well
3291588 if i had to bet i would think hes probably done
3291589 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3291590 ive said all along that experience while being very important
3291591 i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3291592 were going to get going when youre putting different parts together it just doesnt work right away
3291593 when you build a car or you build a plane you need to make some adjustments along the way a team is the same way we just have to continue to correct our mistakes
3291594 joseph played solid in the first half i didnt think they could stop us second half we stopped ourselves
3291595 he was really in the same kind of situation he is now trying to work with new receivers and working with basically a new offence im seeing a lot of good things its just a matter of him getting comfortable
3291596 at times we play well and at times we dont weve got to be more consistent im still growing

3291604 it is becoming increasingly apparent that we need a sea change in the way that many parents and their children fund university for those approaching higher education in the next few years the government has a clear student finance package in place but for parents of younger children one way to stave off the financial nightmares of the current university generation could be to start saving now

3291617 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3291618 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3291619 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3291620 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3291621 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3291622 when consumers misunderstand the fine print regarding their credit cards the credit card companies often make more money through fees and penalties
3291623 credit card users can stop paying more than they have to by learning what some of these common credit card terms rates and fees really mean and we want to help them do that for the sake of minimizing their overall credit card debt
3291624 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3291625 they are treated as a commodity and pay their way into the country as documented workers and then abandoned to fend for themselves
3291626 at every turn people in the establishment either enforcement personnel government officials politicians or businessmen are making money out of the migrant worker
3291627 there are more and more migrant workers turning up without jobs without pay and destitute and left to fend for themselves in a foreign country
3291628 we were stranded and paid our way out of the airport and now survive as illegal workers
3291629 now i only get two meals and a corner in the shop to sleep
3291630 i cant go home my passport has expired and i have been arrested and released at least seven times
3291631 the core problem is that malaysia does not have a comprehensive migrant worker policy that is holistic and humanistic
3291632 current policies are reactive ad hoc wholly contradictory and driven by political consideration
3291633 rampant corruption is a key reason why migrant workers end up being treated as a commodity
3291634 the solution is to hand over the migrant worker sector to the human resources ministry to deal with as a human resource issue
3291635 currently the home ministry handles it because it is seen as a security issue
3291636 imagine the sums involved if you make rm5 000 per worker and you have a recruit quota of 10 000 workers
3291637 outsourcing companies presently get their licenses from the immigration department to recruit workers
3291638 this is unsatisfactory because it is subject to and a major source of abuse and corruption
3291639 we also want a reasonable wage scheme for workers low income workers are currently subject to exploitation due to the poor employment conditions they undergo and are unable to afford decent living especially with rising rates of inflation and an overall increase in the costs of living
3291640 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3291641 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3291642 it is customary that ice works with our law enforcement partners in the u s and in foreign countries providing support and information as each situation warrants
3291643 in the reyes case specifically ice provided support in coordinating interviews with mexican police and witnesses who were american citizens on the u s side of the border
3291644 well im sure you got more detailed information from our press secretary about the precise nature of our activity in this international investigation that involved activity on both sides of the border
3291645 so ice gets involved in law enforcement investigations when they involve activity on both sides of the border whether that activity involves spending money the use of phone cards other sorts of things then we are involved with our foreign counterparts
3291646 and that happens in all kinds of cases on a routine basis but i think i would need to direct you to kelly nantel our press secretary for the specifics of what we actually did in this case and then how it was consistent with our general practice on international involvement
3291647 i would also note that you know its my understanding and you should confirm with her its my understanding though that we were not quote unquote involved in the release of the we did merely provide some space for mexican local law enforcement
3291648 ice provided support in coordinating interviews with mexican police and witnesses who were american citizens on the u s side of the border
3291649 for the purpose of facilitating communication with u s citizens and other sources of information who might have information on the case transportation and interviews of individuals in the united states who were believed to have information related to the kidnapping
3291650 there definitely is an energy crisis and i think its affecting every american
3291651 its a shame pelosi is out promoting her book and taking a vacation when there are a lot of her colleagues here trying to hold the flame and bring the message to the american people that we do have an energy crisis and we have to do something about it
3291652 i think its a really reasonable request given that the house wasnt even supposed to adjourn until aug 11 and it just seems rather suspicious that shes out going on a book tour
3291653 as long as we can just have some debate let them vote i think thats a rather reasonable message
3291654 we dont need to depend on anyone else for energy resources

3291662 we in nu are for the enforcement of islamic law in matters of family and personal law but we are not for an islamic state said gus dur
3291663 theres no obligation on the part of an indonesian muslim to be in favour of an islamic state that was what nu which is the largest islamic group in indonesia agreed to when it was consulted in the formulation of indonesias constitution in 1945
3291664 in later years nu also assented to the national ideology of pancasila which embeds pluralism into our culture
3291665 if we pass a new program we either ought to get rid of the old program or we ought to make it to where it blends with this other one so its effective
3291666 almost everything that theyve offered has a duplicate program out there that theyre not either eliminating or changing

3291669 one year ago the financial world changed completely as the credit crunch took hold today the world of mortgages is a completely different place
3291670 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and london interbank offered rates libor are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
3291671 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
3291672 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3291673 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices however the current confused messages from the government regarding stamp duty risks damaging any returning confidence and may discourage mobility
3291674 she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash and play it by ear instead

3291678 growth was achieved across almost all of our reporting segments in the first six months of 2008
3291679 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
3291680 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3291681 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes
3291682 thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3291683 if you see the recent fall in the crude prices though that is negative for ongc but it has in fact a non event for the company because they have been realising at around usd 70 bbl irrespective of the price movement because when the crude was at around usd 145 bbl and even if they have realised the value at around usd 130 bbl or usd 135 bbl they have to pass on the excess receipts to the downstream companies that is to the oil marketing companies so probably as long as crude remains whether at usd 100 bbl usd 130 140 bbl doesnt make any difference to them because probably the upside or the bottomline of the company is capped and the problem with the company is that they are not sure of what kind of credit note or the credits they have to pass on to the oil marketing companies
3291684 on a quarter on quarter basis they do it on the instructions received from the ministry which is again not a good thing for a listed company taking all into this consideration probably the share price has reached to its level to around rs 1 100 in fact this gives a lot of trading opportunity this could even in investment based trading opportunity so my advice is to get out book profit at these levels

3291690 some ears might not perceive karlens and eriks voice as a strong one but to us their voice is one free from hatred and enmity we were deeply impressed when we read the interview in which these two strong and self confident young people from armenia expressed themselves and the way they look with hope to the future without denying the past
3291691 traumas can only be overcome through mutual understanding having close contacts sharing the pains and listening to each other
3291692 there in that stadium we shall stand shoulder to shoulder together with our friends from the armenian community of istanbul and we shall altogether cry out for peace and friendliness in fact we shall be hugging each other in that stadium as hrant would do if he had lived
3291693 the president will not reply to the letter sent by us congress members but the foreign affairs ministry will do so through the indonesian ambassador in washington
3291694 hoisting a separatist flag in our land is against the laws and will be processed judicially

3291696 this could turn into the biggest advertising coup in olympic history
3291697 i am well aware of the criticism by some people and so it was a difficult decision

3291700 it felt awesome i have been working on this for god knows how long the last two times i finished 17th and 12th
3291701 it is not something that will happen just because us athletes want it to happen
3291702 as we believe there will be no further loss making quarter considering that the tainted assets have been drastically reduced there should also be no danger of a further capital increase
3291703 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3291704 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3291705 how dare you shop for shoes while thousands are dying and homeless

3291728 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice

3291742 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
3291743 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing e gaming photographic images workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
3291744 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these e gaming photographic images workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
3291745 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
3291746 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company
3291747 seven ways to increase productivity in the e gaming photographic images business
3291748 if you tell someone in the e gaming photographic images field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department

3291769 wir gedenken der vielen opfer des unmenschlichen grenzregimes es wurden freunde und familien auseinandergerissen 28 jahre lang trennte diese unsinnige und grausame grenze deutschland von deutschland und den freien teil der welt vom unfreien nirgendwo wird dies deutlicher als im ehemaligen grenzgebiet wo man diese schlimme vergangenheit am eigenen leib erfahren hat und die erinnerung daran wach h lt unsere grenzmuseen m dlareuth und schifflersgrund aber auch point alpha und teistungen sind noch heute beredte zeugnisse f r diese grausame zeit

3291771 die kenntnis von dieser vergangenheit der umgang mit unserer geschichte allgemein sind f r uns alle lebensnotwendig es ist unm glich auf verdr ngung und unkenntnis eine gute zukunft aufzubauen deswegen sind die erinnerung und das gedenken an die opfer wichtig hierbei wird geschichte f r junge menschen erlebbar es geht nicht nur darum wissen zu vermitteln es ist wichtig dass die schulen im freistaat die direkten auswirkungen von diktaturen auf das leben der menschen aufzeigen
3291772 estoy muy satisfecho por la forma en que el equipo ha jugado en los amistosos de este verano especialmente frente al manchester united fc mostramos nuestra fuerza en defensa y supimos disputar un duro choque ante los campeones de europa no hay mejor forma de preparar nuestro partido ante el artmedia adem s podemos contar con gianluigi buffon a ade valor al resto del equipo

3291784 we are considering a way to better reflect these rising costs in the prices of our next pcs
3291785 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3291786 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3291787 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3291788 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3291789 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3291790 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3291791 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3291792 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3291793 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3291794 we are not staying home with our children by default
3291795 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3291796 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3291797 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3291798 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3291799 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3291800 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year

3291802 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3291803 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
3291804 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
3291805 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity

3291824 fresh vegetables would be most severely affected by the changes closely followed by
3291825 basically the changes could lead to lower production goods that are of lower quality
3291826 fungicides containing triazole and strobilurin could be banned if because they are difficult to assess and there is no replacement for these to protect against late season diseases
3291827 we cannot understand why at a time of high prices and food shortages sufficient assessments have not been carried out or why other countries have not realised the seriousness of the situation
3291828 bahut bura laga bahut afsos huwa i felt really bad i was very sorry when they decided to ban my film
3291829 i had done extensive research for the movie and had consulted mughal and rajput manuscripts various historians said jodhaa was called by different names like harkha bai and bhanumati but when i met members of the jaipur royal family they said the name jodhaa was the most popular among them hence i decided to stick to it
3291830 the deleted scenes were cut with a heavy heart no matter how big a hit my movie was the deleted scenes were really special they have their own mahatwa importance
3291831 scenes showing akbar and birbal which hold a special place in my heart will also be screened
3291832 buzurg elderly people who did not get the opportunity to watch the movie in a theatre can now watch it with their entire family
3291833 a film as big and as successful as jodhaa akbar needed a special platform jodhaa akbar completes its silver jubilee on august 15 everyone will be at home on the national holiday we will screen the movie at 11 in the morning right after the prime minister finishes his speech from the ramparts of the red fort so that the old and the young can enjoy the chutti holiday
3291834 my next film whats your rashee starring harman baweja and priyanka chopra is being produced by the utv group
3291835 ideally we would have liked to release the home video of the movie before the satellite premiere of the film but now we will be releasing it 10 15 days after it airs on television the value of the home video definitely comes down after the satellite premiere but it is difficult to say at this point in time whether it will affect sales or not however our strategy is to promote the home video release of the film during the tv airing
3291836 jodhaa akbar home video is a collectors item and we believe that the first airing on television is not going to affect its home video sales its a product that people will want to own and keep
3291837 the home video has a lot of special features and we wanted to make sure that we give out the right product with the right quality hence the delay however the product has a life of its own and we believe that people will want to own it
3291838 australias future will also depend on our ability to engage constructively and effectively with the countries of the asia pacific
3291839 that is why i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3291840 by investing in asian languages and cultural education in australias schools my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them

3291881 zanu pf and its allies are still committing violent abuses undermining the partys credibility as a political partner
3291882 instead of focusing on quick political fixes president thabo mbeki and other sadc leaders should look for a durable solution and that means first of all an immediate end to human rights violations

3291919 i was looking for a monitoring surveillance tool that would allow me to identify detect and troubleshoot problems long before the phones started ringing or the executives beat me up in the hallways because the network was down
3291920 i had tremendous success with groundwork while working for another company
3291921 because of the fact it was open source it was far cheaper the company itself was a great implementer and the tool was geared towards the type of monitoring surveillance that i needed in my business thats ultimately why i selected it a lot of it was price driven but there was a lot of functionality decisions that i made based on groundwork groundwork requires far far less support than most of the other primary proprietary software vendors

3291997 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
3291998 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
3291999 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

3292013 het was heel hard deze morgen na mijn twee wedstrijden van gisteren overal had ik pijn dus ik wist dat het heel hard zou zijn op het einde van de opwarming met steve darcis ging het beter maar in het begin van de wedstrijd ging het niet vanaf 2 2 verbeterde het weer maar het bleef hier heel warm dus het was een fysiek harde wedstrijd
3292014 jammer natuurlijk dat de match op zon manier moet eindigen maar voor mij is het toch beter dat ik minder lang op de baan moest staan het derde spel was echt belangrijk had ik dat verloren dan had hij in deze warmte waarschijnlijk gewonnen in twee korte sets zo zie je maar dat een paar punten een hele wedstrijd kunnen bepalen in tennis
3292015 ik ben dus heel tevreden ik had vooraf 10 keer getekend om mijn eerste drie wedstrijden hier te winnen voor morgen ben ik niet bang maar ik weet wel dat het extreem hard wordt vandaag ga ik rusten en me goed verzorgen en aangezien gonzalez en cilic hun wedstrijd vanavond spelen zal de wedstrijd morgen waarschijnlijk niet in de voormiddag zijn zowel gonzalez als cilic zijn op papier beter dan mij maar ik probeer zoals altijd mijn spel te spelen en mijn best te doen en dan zien we wel

3292046 the eu claims that member states are well advanced with their implementation plans for exportation ecs2 and transit ncts4 which will facilitate the submission by trade of pre departure data
3292047 the ongoing delay in the provision of these specifications almost guarantees the implementation next july will be problematic risking a potential brake on eu wide export activity that can only harm the eus bottom line

3292049 by legislating for papd the ec is seeking to establish a common eu wide standard level of protection in customs controls for goods brought into or dispatched from the european community to take effect from july 2009

3292068 brian my first job on leaving school in the distant past was as a trailer mate in the days when you had to have a mate when hauling a drawbar trailer i worked two years on a leyland super comet drag car carrier for wa glendinning so imagine how i felt when i came across this fabulous restoration of frank willis as well as getting the livery just right for 1959 this is one of the first super comets ever made and frank restored the mechanics spot on

3292070 there is a reason romance novels all seem to read alike

3292075 rebecca and i are massive fans of the films and when were planning the wedding we thought why not star wars
3292076 it was a lot of fun after all its not everyday you get to be married by yoda
3292077 the wedding was so informal at the start but obviously when the actual ceremony took place people became at bit more respectful
3292078 the wedding was presided over by yoda who had secured his marriage licence off the internet in the weeks beforehand and the ring bearer was none other than princess leia sporting her famous gold bikini
3292079 you have never seen people more excited to be dressed up in star wars gear everybody totally got into the swing of things
3292080 there was no division of the wedding guests between the jedi and the empire but that would have been a pretty neat idea if we could have done that
3292081 i thought the boy showed fantastic focus a great attitude to work hard and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game
3292082 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3292083 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3292084 this information is useful not just for palate and teeth but also for cancer and cell biology in general ultimately we have to be translational in order to make ourselves useful to patients

3292132 houbo unha poca en que a escaseza de vendas se tentou subsanar coa ampliaci n dos puntos de venda a creaci n de novas feiras e por iso as feiras perderon parte do seu sentido foise esgotando o modelo e con el o propio esforzo dos libreiros
3292133 o certo que para o esforzo non era rendible e de a que se cuestionase a presenza de editores e libreiros
3292134 estou dacordo que a presenza do libro non foi tan significativa como nos gustar a agora ben hab a 12 stands con presenza espec fica noutros espazos pero n s queremos que en todas as librar as haxa unha representaci n significativa
3292135 a cuesti n que as feiras do libro son moi repetitivas
3292136 nisto s que coincidimos todos pero queremos introducir algunhas novidades o esquema b sico vaise manter pero se incorporar n unha serie de alicientes e se far n modificaci ns en canto a n mero de participantes xunto con cambios como o de engadir alg n pabill n espec fico con cousas relacionadas coa tecnolox a iso s sempre no esquema tradici nal da coru a cunha presenza alta de escritores e de autores galegos mentres buscamos reforzar a presenza de escritores de mbito internacional
3292137 entendemos que necesario unha reformulaci n das feiras vemos que van mellorando alg ns aspectos que criticabamos a pouca relevancia do libro galego pero creo que c mpre unha reflexi n profunda de todo o sector
3292138 o que temos que ser mais imaxinativos en elementos que sirvan de atractivo para a xente est ben que haxa presentaci ns pero deber a optarse cara outros incentivos para o novo p blico xa que as actividades que se organizan est n m is pensadas para os que xa son lectores e ademais fanse todo o ano

3292152 were doing a lot of creative design work to come up with something that im sure will excite the world
3292153 its more than an advertising campaign its getting smart about the reputation of the city and the state to drive investment jobs attract more overseas students and that drives more tourism
3292154 it is still going it is instantly recognisable it is loved throughout the united states including by those who dont like new york

3292161 low vitamin d levels seem to confer an increased risk of dying from any cause
3292162 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes

3292165 as we believe there will be no further loss making quarter considering that the tainted assets have been drastically reduced there should also be no danger of a further capital increase
3292166 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3292167 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3292168 you are you one of them you people sure like em books doncha
3292169 they dont need to do the same elsewhere simply because what is happening in georgia has already driven home the message that what happens in these russian enclaves wherever they are is for russia to determine and no one else
3292170 the message is you do not touch any of them because the russian military is determined to defend them even if it means crossing an international border with their tanks

3292172 the current system would seem to favour the rich at the expense of paye employees and that is not fair and that is an anomaly which needs correcting i dont think such a change would mean charities getting less money quite the opposite
3292173 if paye people know they will be able to claim the relief back they will probably give the charity more or invest the rebate in another charity of their choice so in that sense everyone will win

3292191 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3292192 if we find an easy agreement maybe we can finish our discussions but it may take another meeting after that to get together
3292193 we are relying on the understanding of other partners in this effort were asking people to look closely and quickly in the nuclear suppliers group to move expeditiously and we hope that will happen and then well go to the us congress
3292194 were trying to listen to other governments and well have a more complete discussion later this month with the other nuclear suppliers
3292195 now that india has told us theyre ready to move forward were determined to move as far as we can as quickly as we can
3292196 i think the one good thing is that the agreement got a lot of strong support from both parties when it first went to the congress and they passed the hyde act and that was very bipartisan
3292197 that was certainly i think part of the discussion in the clinton administration i dont think its really been a product of more recent discussions because of the reaction of our senate and others expressed about the treaty
3292198 india has made it very clear thats not on the cards
3292199 who has played a commendable role in highlighting the threat posed by c diff and the inadequacies of our response to it
3292200 however decisions like this should not be left to individual coroners and action should be taken at national level to ensure that all hospitals test for individual strains of c diff
3292201 c diff now poses a very significant threat to hospital patients
3292202 we also know that earlier 15 patients who died at ennis hospital had all had c diff in may the health protection surveillance centre reported that as many as 40 patients a week were being diagnosed with c diff
3292203 the approach has been far too casual so far c diff was only made a notifiable condition in march it is alarming in fact to learn that it is not standard practice to test for individual strains of the condition and steps should be taken to ensure that this is now done without delay
3292204 id ask outlets to take the necessary steps over the coming weeks to make sure they are in a position to accept waste batteries towards the end of september while shops are the port of call for us consumers it is battery producers that are financing this new scheme which is part of a europe wide initiative this is a huge step forward for recycling i think nearly all homes have a store of good for nothing batteries buried somewhere come the end of september they can go to a new home safely
3292205 the health service executive wishes to advise also that its community welfare officers cwos are currently involved in providing individuals with small scale emergency exceptional or urgent needs payments to offset immediate hardship this assistance is especially for those on low incomes e g those in receipt of social welfare payments low wages and part time workers such individuals would have either no insurance or such is inadequate to meet essential needs consideration is given in respect of household items furniture floor covering electrical appliances bedding and personal clothing rent allowances can be claimed by those unable to return to their own homes in the short term and who need to rent alternative accommodation

3292207 my view was blocked most of the time by the players bodies when they moved to the other end of the court the referee would be standing in front of me so it was really difficult to get a clear picture

3292275 la detecci n de una nueva cepa del virus de gripe aviar en frica aumenta las serias preocupaciones mientras sigue sin saberse c mo se introdujo esta variedad al continente
3292276 parece ins lito que las aves salvajes hayan acarreado la cepa a africa ya que la ltima migraci n de stas desde europa y asia central a africa ocurri en septiembre de 2007 y la migraci n del sur al continente no ha comenzado todav a este a o
3292277 ciertamente pudo haber otros canales para la introducci n del virus comercio internacional por ejemplo o traslado ilegal y no denunciado de aves de corral esto aumenta el riesgo de que la gripe aviaria se extienda a otros pa ses del oeste de africa

3292309 russias government has urgently earmarked more than 200 million to prevent the humanitarian catastrophe from worsening
3292310 we have reserved 10 billion for 2009 but of course reconstruction should be started this year whether it will take a billion two or three will be determined and then we will make adjustments in the 2008 budget
3292311 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
3292312 for i determined not to know anything among you except jesus christ and him crucified
3292313 this means ones confession is to believe jesus christ is who he says he is meaning he is god in flesh 1 tim
3292314 and everyone who calls on the name of the lord yahweh will be saved
3292315 marvel not that i say unto you that ye must be born again for that which is born of spirit is spirit and that which is born of the flesh is flesh
3292316 to whom we did not yield submission even for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you
3292317 i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness comes through the law then christ died in vain
3292318 moreover brethren i declare to you the gospel which i preached to you which also you received and in which you stand by which also you are saved if you hold fast that word which i preached to you unless you believed in vain for i delivered to you first of all that which i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
3292319 even if we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you let him be accursed
3292320 to open their eyes in order to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me
3292321 even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing whose minds the god of this age has blinded who do not believe lest the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god should shine on them
3292322 and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts
3292323 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
3292324 we are adopted into his family that spans from the beginning of the church until the resurrection

3292327 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
3292328 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
3292329 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
3292330 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
3292331 the federal reserve oldest and simplest trick has been to let banks try earning their way out of trouble by cutting short term interest rates
3292332 what we can say is that banks in general have been less dependent on yield curve profits in recent times than they were in 1990 whatever the prevailing yield curve environment due to business risk diversification and generally more disciplined interest risk management

3292366 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3292367 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3292368 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3292369 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3292370 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3292371 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects

3292407 you just try to make plays and take advantage of the opportunities
3292408 theyve done some things over the past few years that have been very impressive and teams have had to gameplan for them but you cant put me on that level yet
3292409 it definitely has changed how people look at special teams
3292410 and it kind of helped me to come along at a time when those guys were doing their thing definitely it opens a lot of eyes and it gives guys opportunities who might not have had those opportunities before
3292411 they have me doing what im doing for a reason so im just coming out and my primary position is wherever im playing that down
3292412 im just coming out trying to do what they ask of me continuing to work hard and try to get better
3292413 but its a team thing the returns are only going to be as good as the guys up front and its so much fun to have the type of guys blocking here with the great athletes that we have blocking for you it makes it a lot easier on the return when holes open like that
3292414 its much too soon to make that comparison im just a youngster trying to learn the ropes what he was able to accomplish in his career i really respect and admire him for it but im not even close to being a troy brown
3292415 its great to learn from him the knowledge that he has of the game the success that hes had
3292416 its an honor to be in this situation where i can play for him and im just grateful for this opportunity
3292417 i think we know that were all lucky and were all fortunate
3292418 i wasted a lot of energy physically and psychologically to make my weight i thought i would be able to compensate with my will but it was not enough
3292419 i will now move up to bantamweight and plan to turn professional next year
3292420 we need a bigger squad to finish seventh sixth fifth in the league
3292421 if we sign a few more players we will be a stronger team then we will have no choice but to try to finish higher and i feel we can do that
3292422 another nail in the coffin of the u s consumer who is already suffering from the weak labor market high inflation and falling house prices
3292423 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3292424 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3292425 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3292426 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3292427 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3292428 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3292429 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3292430 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3292431 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3292432 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3292433 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3292434 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3292435 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3292436 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3292437 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3292438 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3292439 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3292440 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3292441 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3292442 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3292443 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3292444 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3292445 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3292446 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3292447 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3292448 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3292449 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3292454 attack took about half of the day i e a bit less than 10 hours
3292455 so if you have a gige lan any trojaned machine can poison your dns during one night
3292456 while i think its bad that anybody who can hammer you at gige speed for ten hours can poison your cache its not a threat to the real world the way 11 seconds at 10 megabit was
3292457 any dns server with a host based firewall can implement a 100 percent effective mitigation for the polyakov attack and its possible that an upstream outboard firewall could also be made to do it
3292458 at some point isc will have to put logic like this into bind of course but protecting against the polyakov attack is like synflood protection in that its a rate limit problem
3292459 its long past time for secure dns which is a combination of tsig tkey sig 0 and dnssec end to end crypto authentication
3292460 in the time it would take for this russians attack to work over your 512k dsl line 2 2 years i heard we could completely secure the dns or at least the parts of dns whose operators gave a rats ass about security
3292461 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3292462 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3292463 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3292464 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3292465 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3292466 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way

3292487 hamish henderson played a hugely important part in scottish culture for more than 40 years he was the founder of the edinburgh peoples festival for one thing we will recall how he shaped the cultural fabric of scottish life for almost half a century
3292488 his contribution to folk music alone stands as a towering achievement he was a writer and lyricist who has left us many significant pieces of work uppermost perhaps his beautiful and inspiring ballad freedom come all ye hamish was a working class intellectual
3292489 it has taken far too long for this memorial to hamish to come to fruition i admit but then again its better late then never

3292502 he was just annoying and he thought he was the only guy in the stadium
3292503 but it didnt really matter i dont think that played a role in the match
3292504 to be blunt this is the one medal i dont have
3292505 its hard its hard when its probably my last olympics
3292506 im going to shoot next year because it will be my 40th year representing canada
3292507 all you need is one person to show you can do it

3292509 her role in trapshooting has been big and she has done many good things so womens trap is at a high level at the moment

3292532 the difference between two years ago is that they have done a lot of work while we stopped working
3292533 i was nervous in the beginning because this is my first time at the olympics

3292536 i know the aussie way now start like a scalded kangaroo
3292537 the australian coach is taking tapes of us making tackles they took those to the technical delegate tried to stir it up about our play to see if the refs get involved
3292538 i found that a shame and i wanted to let them know that were a proud country and were proud of where we are and we deserve to be here
3292539 i think they respected our play why else would you bother wasting time with little old canada no 15 in the world we took that as a bit of a confidence boost for us we kept quiet and after the game i let them know
3292540 they were in the papers saying that when they play canada its going to be half hockey half rugby
3292541 well you know we just play tough hockey we play within the rules
3292542 not only us there were a whole bunch of other countries that they thought were a bit physical and stuff but thats gamesmanship it happens in all sports
3292543 it is one if we are to progress up the ladder and world rankings we must get it
3292544 weve played them a couple of times theyve been close games we beat them once we tied them once and they beat us once
3292545 there are winnable games we played great britain and we did okay with them south africa i think is ranked close to us but theyre probably thinking the same

3292547 that would take days in canada it was very very good care im very thankful to them they got me back on my feet the doctors there did everything they could to try to get me back to competition
3292548 really good care because i was the only patient there
3292549 theres a whole wing dedicated to the olympics and i was the only one so i got all the treatment
3292550 i wasnt feeling great at all i shot really well so i was happy with that performance and coming out here for mondays team event ive been feeling better and better every day
3292551 we ran down the stairs five flights of stairs ran to the ambulance and he wasnt looking too good
3292552 being a former lifeguard he was in shock with the symptoms he had we were a little worried then we kept a close tab on what he was doing and how he was doing the day after
3292553 i couldnt eat for two days even when i was out of hospital i lost my appetite for saturdays ranking round i didnt eat anything i was completely drained i had to get a fellow shooter to score my arrows for me id just sit down after every six but i shot in or around my average so i was happy with that

3292555 the good news is that there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the wto members had agreed since last year that is end 2008
3292556 i hope it will not be the case that i get priced out of a move
3292557 if the club dont want me they know that ive been a faithful servant so in a perfect world being allowed to leave for a reasonable price would happen
3292558 there were some folks who thought maybe we were compromising because we thought we couldnt win the election and that was not the case

3292564 to be an olympian is such a big thing its not like you see very many
3292565 to be the same year and the same class and really good friends makes it even that much sweeter
3292566 but to see a face from home one you grew up with is definitely cool being at the olympics is something weve talked about since grade 7
3292567 we definitely dont need to talk to each other all the time but we just know were good friends and go back and pick up where we left off its like we never missed a day
3292568 i was in the 12 year old division and he was in the 11 year old division because he has a late birthday he won the 11 year olds and i won the 12 year olds except he just about lapped me
3292569 that was my big thing i always had him in running
3292570 i think it will be probably a painful race for the lgbt community and also for my partner when they hear the focus of the discussion

3292573 i came here and found out the president of grenada boxing made a mistake
3292574 i was entered in the wrong category thats more than a 10 pound difference i had to gain weight in nine days
3292575 they told me some guy was going to the olympics and wanted to talk to me
3292576 i thought it was odd this guy has qualified for the olympics and he is on his own
3292577 it would have been great if i could have trained with syd for two months
3292578 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3292579 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3292580 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3292581 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3292582 it would end up putting significantly more pressure on anyone in the legislature who cares about the employees of the state
3292583 theres no penalty for failing to pass a budget on time
3292584 were focused on compelling the controller to comply with the law
3292585 although i will continue to pay public servants their full wages it is unfortunate that taxpayers will now have to foot the bill for this governors reckless and unnecessary legal battle
3292586 theyre not going to give up on their beliefs because state workers are being paid the minimum wage

3292589 i wanted to try and get out into open water and i was in the outside lane so it was kind of difficult for the others to see me i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3292590 i dont want to say i cruised it the 23 year old commented of his or heat and lets try to keep these things straight
3292591 i think michael knows we didnt do this for him lezak pointedly observed later
3292592 he was a part of it whether he wins eight or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3292593 i had a bit of a hard time in marshalling the suit wouldnt zip up i had to get changed into an old suit
3292594 im just running on a bit of stress and adrenaline at the moment its all catching up with me
3292595 there is no issue its people not zipping the suit up correctly not the suit
3292596 but i think well be happier once canada has a medal
3292597 if anything it promotes it and sends people to their tv sets
3292598 como sou racional n o aceito ser conduzido por um ser irracional ent o explique racionalmente
3292599 economic growth is likely to be 7 7 per cent this fiscal it is unlikely to be more than this though it may fall below
3292600 interest rates have moved up and there has been a slowdown in exports to us rest of asia and cost of fuel has increased slowing down the manufacturing sector
3292601 but today i feel 30 it doesnt matter on the piste whether i win or lose i wanted to show im still young
3292602 this is a very special thing because of her age and because the children can watch their mother in the olympic games
3292603 you can see also how popular she is in china ask anybody on the street and theyll know her name
3292604 but my husband said go and do it you have nothing to lose
3292605 the next thing we know australias in our lane which in 10 years of rowing ive never seen anything like that its just bizarre all of a sudden you saw them coming over and they just about hit the back of our boat
3292606 the only thing thats unexpected is its in china and the chinese havent thrown anything at us yet
3292607 i was expecting something bizarre to be happening here but its gone very smoothly
3292608 you hear stories from the communist games back in the 60s and 70s of like fire alarms going off at midnight and dirty tricks like that being played but none of thats happening
3292609 you want to have that full gas tank to empty in the olympic final
3292610 success is not the key to happiness happiness is the key to success if you love what you are doing you will be successful
3292611 i didnt know if my body was going to be able to do it
3292612 you feel helpless youre thinking what direction is this going to go its just such an unknown theres no certainties
3292613 when i told the physiotherapist yeah im going to be rowing again next year she said well dont count on it
3292614 to make food was a big deal to make a cup of coffee i would stand up grind the beans lie on the floor everything i did i had to stop and lay down
3292615 it was brutal after the olympics its natural to go through a depression but i just went into a serious funk that winter was the lowest time of my life by far
3292616 its really how much you have a desire to hurt how much you have a desire to be in a competitive environment
3292617 that hadnt gone away at all if anything i realized how much i missed that
3292618 it would be like hed fire up in front of me and id stick on his wheel and sprint past him at the end and hed be so mad
3292619 he just hates losing in any form whatsoever whether it be crib cribbage cycling or rowing
3292620 what finance does is give you the tools to use as a lens for interpreting whats going on in the world
3292621 its kind of like a big game in many ways its the most competitive and dynamic field there is
3292622 shes had better outings and she would probably admit that but the thing is you give her the ball because shes been here and shes done that
3292623 and she knows maybe how to pitch when all the cylinders arent firing
3292624 its a long tournament so i think everybodys going to touch the ball but shes the veteran so shes going to get it
3292625 that helps a lot especially when youre trying to work through some stuff
3292626 it allows you to just completely relax and focus on what you need to do without the pressure when one run might mean a ball game that wasnt the case today
3292627 that was huge the fact that we came out in the second inning and scored a couple of runs was amazing
3292628 it allowed me to fight through what i was fighting through and allowed me to rely on my defence
3292629 if the people of this country can do these amazing things and put on this amazing show how come they cant keep the lead out of their toy paint

3292647 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3292648 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3292649 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3292650 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3292651 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3292652 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3292653 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3292654 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3292655 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were
3292656 we touched and groped each other but there was no way i was going to have sex in the house
3292657 the only problem was the bed was so high i nearly fell off and broke my neck at different stages
3292658 we simply couldnt on my eviction night because we needed to talk first and there was too much going on
3292659 without saying a word we knew what was going to happen it was inevitable
3292660 the setting was perfect the lights were dim and rebecca and i have never known such luxury
3292661 anytime you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3292662 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown
3292663 and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support there are some good things too i take the good with the bad with that i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3292664 i think we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3292665 they are using half people karolyi said after the tiny chinese womens team grabbed a significant lead over the americans in team competition sunday night
3292666 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
3292667 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like he said
3292668 you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
3292669 they understood it a 10 is perfect that is good for the sport what is this system they say it cannot be manipulated it can be manipulated
3292670 nbc is spending more than 1 billion to broadcast the olympic games to the u s they believe footage available on other web sites would take away their audience
3292671 expands to any footage filmed within the accredited area or interviews conducted within the accredited area
3292672 an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside of ireland
3292673 realistically this means we need to block all live streams radio and television because we cannot monitor all of the streams 24 hours
3292674 its not even common for the olympics no other sporting event in the world requires this level of restrictions including the 2004 games
3292675 were making more of these olympics available to american audiences by far than any olympics in history
3292676 kelly was the ultimate host and even when the bar bill began to spiral out of control she refused to close the tab
3292677 she had 30 very thirsty pals so it was always going to be a pretty big night
3292678 bono arrived quite late and kelly told him to order whatever he liked a good night was had by all
3292679 even if you fought 19 grandmothers in a row its still kind of notable to get all of them out of there in the first round
3292680 look i know tyrone has been moved slow there have been some bumps along the way but were on the way now ive seen him spar with guys like
3292681 i truly believe tyrone has what it takes to be special hes got everything hes got the heart hes got the chin and obviously he has the power
3292682 after the olympics im hopeful it can be built back up to where it was
3292683 this is something thats needed for these kids to get an education through boxing weve had a lot of kids who graduated from high school others who have gone on to get college degrees we even have some who got their masters no other program in boxing offers what we do
3292684 we look forward to having such a program here for many decades in the future
3292685 after the loss to yuri i spent some time with my family and hooking up with visionquest where i worked with kids

3292699 they try to add a whole bunch of other evidence and try to make a decision about authentication

3292872 while some want to book profits to cover for losses incurred elsewhere others want to take advantage of the attractive valuations in the u s and other emerging markets
3292873 we need to check the number of airplanes landing to the tourism resorts with the purpose of vacation during the summer season this number has increased recently
3292874 many politicians world renowned businessmen come to spend their holidays in the other luxurious high quality hotels of my friends our hotels stand out since the news concerning these hotels is reflected in the press extensively
3292875 our primary objective as rixos hotels was to become a world brand we opened our first hotel in 2001 we particularly targeted the upper segments of the society and examined the examples in the world
3292876 afterwards we launched crucial advertisements for instance the number of tourists coming to our hotels from the gulf countries was extremely limited two years ago we went to these countries and advertised our hotels the fact that the leaders of those countries come and spend their holidays in our hotels is a major factor that enhances the interest of the customers in these countries from the upper segments of the society in our hotels
3292877 the media keeps referring to the prices of a couple of extremely expensive villas and rooms our citizens think that people stay in these hotels for thousands of dollars
3292878 however the reality is totally different for instance the revenue per tourist in our hotels ranges from 300 to 400 those expensive villas merely appeal to the taste of a very limited number of customers
3292879 in spite of the present turbulence in the property and financing market vastned retail has succeeded in increasing rental income due to its strategic focus on retail property
3292880 moreover it contributes to turkish economy and environment as well as industrialists by doubling the life period of industry lubricants the annual consumption of which is 500 000 tons
3292881 one of the nanotechnology products that will offer important benefits to the humanity in the new millennium
3292882 beyaz konaklar stands out with its advantageous location diverse social facilities including a security system and a closed parking garage
3292883 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
3292884 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
3292885 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
3292886 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
3292887 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
3292888 it is a very joyful tour for families and children a different city is visited every day places that most people like to see can be seen in a single tour
3292889 it is very difficult and expensive to find a room in a fine hotel in antalya
3292890 one night costs 100 euros in a good hotel this is why tunisia tours receive great interest because its price is reasonable and people see a different country at the same cost prices change between 349 and 399 euros for a four night and five day tour to tunisia
3292891 all their traveling was by bus until recently the distance between istanbul and alanya is 12 hours by bus but between istanbul and thailand its just nine hours by plane
3292892 prices are not too low but those who make reservations in turkish hotels in this season have to pay nearly 700 euros this is a great reason to go to a foreign country that does not require a visa
3292893 also i dont advise brazil and argentine because the season is winter in these countries while it is summer in turkey and there is storm season in cuba which gives a visa easily and it costs 1 500 euros
3292894 because of its vast wind resources open terrain and industrial infrastructure turkey is predicted to be among the worlds fastest growing wind energy markets
3292895 our highly experienced management team has extensive expertise in turkeys energy industry utilizing amsc windtecs designs and expertise our company will be the first wind turbine manufacturer in turkey and is ideally positioned to capitalize on this advancing market
3292896 turkey has one of the fastest growing economies in the world and like all growing economies it needs more sources of power generation to enable its continued strong growth
3292897 with the countrys electricity demand expected to rise 7 to 8 percent annually in the coming years the turkish government is increasingly promoting wind power to bolster the security of the countrys power supply gain additional energy independence and reduce emissions model enerji has a first mover advantage in this dynamic market and has the technical expertise strong management and experienced partners needed to achieve long term success
3292898 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
3292899 but i am saying there is no way in which it fits with the culturally sophisticated brand i wish to sell
3292900 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it so were going to do exactly that
3292901 if its a success and ive no reason to suspect it wont be well roll it out across all our cinemas and make it a permanent fixture
3292902 audiences in three venues began asking for popcorn so we provided it
3292903 at 1 1 5 liters per person per year our wine consumption is very low a significant portion up to half is consumed by visiting foreign tourists
3292904 yet foreigners dont know anything about turkish wine they want more information but there just werent any references
3292905 governments smart enough to realize this make wine production a national policy and make it a point to introduce their wines to the rest of the world
3292906 begin initiating some serious projects bringing foreign wine journalists to turkey and letting them see our vineyards and taste our wines
3292907 i know many people who want to drink wine but are intimidated by the price

3292912 in recent years more and more western pharmaceutical corporations such as gsk roche novo nordisk and others have come to china and set up r amp d centers
3292913 as of 2004 three years after chinas wto entry nearly all global pharmaceutical companies have already completed their accession into the chinese market and will gradually shift their focus to research development the main reasons for overseas companies coming to china have been to save costs by using the extensive science and technology research bases currently in place in china the abundant human resources and less expensive medical and clinical trials
3292914 mutations of the traditional influenza virus cannot naturally become deadly virulent it takes laboratory assistance and the addition of toxic adjuvants in a prepared vaccine to accomplish this task in short the only way for a pandemic to occur is if it is pre planned and lab induced as a biological weapon
3292915 a reader has asked me to comment on the rather alarming document reproduced on august 8 2005 in epoch times
3292916 what about the several millions of our compatriots in the united states
3292917 there are 6 7 billion humans on planet earth this equates to a statistical infection rate of 000000004215 percent in other words statistically speaking you are over 100 000 times more likely to be hit by lightning in your home than to contract the bird flu
3292918 the world is teetering on the edge of a flu pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population
3292919 an outbreak of avian influenza would kill between 5 million and 150 million people on each continent
3292920 the current u s capacity for manufacturing egg based vaccines is not sufficient to supply our entire population hhs is supporting research into human kidney cell based vaccine manufacture of producing vaccine domestically
3292921 the fda can use its emergency use authorization authority to permit the use of unapproved products if theres a reasonable belief the products may be effective

3292923 oh i see so we have conjured up a large meteor now interesting well thats uniform layers up the spout it would lose matter as it hit the atmosphere but it would not break up of course and would not be drawn to the magnetic poles
3292924 the layers of the geocolumn could only happen with rapid flood sediment deposition and normal aggregate seperation some of the layers show mixing as happens in wave motion
3292925 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it

3292931 a reader has asked me to comment on the rather alarming document reproduced on august 8 2005 in epoch times
3292932 what about the several millions of our compatriots in the united states
3292933 there are 6 7 billion humans on planet earth this equates to a statistical infection rate of 000000004215 percent in other words statistically speaking you are over 100 000 times more likely to be hit by lightning in your home than to contract the bird flu

3292938 they always tell you what their going to do before they do it
3292939 feral cats arent all that bad on small islands that also have rats
3292940 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3292941 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3292942 wont see the lunar eclipse because it will occur two hours before the sun sets
3292943 a family of four can travel much more cheaply in an rv than by flying where youd have to buy four tickets and youre not going to be eating out at restaurants three times a day youre going to be cooking in the rv you also dont have to pay for a hotel room so a family can save money in the long run
3292944 the first official message ever in which he speaks english
3292945 banks main business of lending to the state was no longer profitable so they focused on consumer lending because many turks did not have bank accounts the fastest way to build business was to hand out credit cards until then lending in turkey had been confined primarily to families consumer loans were too expensive or too hard to get
3292946 when credit cards are handed out to unsophisticated consumers as they often are in shopping malls factories and university campuses in middle income developing countries they can pile up debts that can take years to pay off if ever
3292947 now industry experts say they see similar dangers in rapidly growing markets like turkey and china where there are more than 100 million cards
3292948 from 2003 to 2006 consumer groups said 41 people died because of credit card debt either through suicide or homicide in one widely publicized case a 37 year old policeman shot himself in the head on an istanbul street after friends tried to wrest the gun from him he was depressed over 40 000 in debts
3292949 while that is not excessive by world standards it is higher than the 5 17 percent rate in the united states
3292950 you still dont have the kinds of credit information in turkey that you have in the united states
3292951 so youre not going to be able to ratchet down the level of bad credit like you can here
3292952 despite the increase in credit card ownership the percentage of cards that cause trouble is low it diminished from 8 percent in january 2007 to 6 percent in may 2008 moreover debt per card is merely 639 compared to 5 550 in the united states
3292953 the turkish energy situation resembles the danish energy situation 20 years ago
3292954 the adverse weather that war brings out clouds our eyes the war puts our projects in both russia and georgia in jeopardy georgia has a key importance to turkey we have dreamed about a motorway project which would reach eastern asia by crossing kars tbilisi baku and russia for a century as well as the pipeline projects such projects in which turkey plays a key role would considerably contribute to the development of the region therefore the threat on these project could downgrade turkey at least two steps
3292955 there are nearly 100 turkish firms operating in georgia with around 600 million worth of investments
3292956 if turkey becomes a part of the war between the two countries that would be a big mistake as the business world we should be cautious and keep being guided by common sense
3292957 russia has interests in the region in terms of energy
3292958 russia will be cautious over the btc pipeline otherwise it might face a vast commercial loss
3292959 we reach the caucasus countries by crossing through georgia and such a trouble in this destination is quite upsetting
3292960 the btc pipeline is crucial for the transportation sector georgia is our alternative destination in reaching the turkic republics due to the price difference implemented in iran our trucks have been on hold since saturday at 4 p m re establishment of the regions stability is the key for us turkish business world should not retreat in action

3292982 you may hear many dates but i caution you not to take any of these dates until you get the final document
3292983 these victories should taste like a defeat for both sides
3292984 the president will feel stronger and the governors will feel stronger and i foresee more confrontation
3292985 we warn the corrupt and arrogant rulers not to try to impose an illegal and racist constitutional project because that would be a dead end for them
3292986 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources
3292987 the endorsement of the governors will radicalize the tension in the country a great deal more
3292988 the two sides agreed to continue negotiations in a constructive atmosphere
3292989 solana and jalili voiced satisfaction at the constructive trend of negotiations in geneva and the contacts afterwards

3293026 it was not an unreasonable calculation to go for a rapid win but in the end it was a miscalculation
3293027 the capital tskhinvali is relatively small no more than around 25 000 people and they probably thought they could just take it and be done
3293028 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
3293029 the russians have been provoking for a long time and i dont doubt that they stoked up the separatists to start attacking
3293030 at the same time if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily and at this stage it seems uncertain that they will stop
3293031 if the russians hadnt intervened and georgia had taken over some south ossetians would have fled but most probably would have been okay and south ossetia probably would have been better off economically and culturally
3293032 as it is now they are looking at being a small outpost on the southern reaches of russia
3293033 estou muito confiante acho que posso ter bons resultados nos 200 m borboleta essa tem sido a prova em que tenho me sentido melhor

3293035 eine solche milit roffensive im 21 jahrhundert ist nicht hinnehmbar
3293036 die georgischen f hrer konnten dies nur mit dem gef hl machen von einer viel gr eren macht unterst tzt und ermutigt zu werden
3293037 gepaart mit dem versprechen eines nato beitritts hat dies die georgischen f hrer glauben lassen dass sie einen schnellen krieg in s dossetien f hren k nnten
3293038 kita nggak akan ladeni itu ngapain kita ikut bodoh seperti pelapor
3293039 kalau memalsu apa yang dipalsukan kalau menipu siapa yang ditipu

3293043 if you wish to see the change of power in baku just wait here for several hours it is changing in this country like the baku wind
3293044 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3293045 thats not enough who guarantees that you will continue the moratorium lift the death penalty and then expect us extradite turkish criminals or people on wanted list
3293046 during my stay in damascus some people approached me and told me that they planned to kill prime minister tansu iller they wanted me to claim responsibility for the assassination i rejected this offer
3293047 from the beginning even back to 1976 there had been attempts to infiltrate the pkk
3293048 teach turkish to women everyone can use their mother tongue but it will lead to deadlock to expect state services to be in all the mother languages
3293049 i regret that some of our partners are not helping us but in fact are trying to impede us i am referring to the us transfer aboard its military transport planes and directly into the conflict zone of the georgian military contingent from iraq
3293050 russia will bring its peacekeeping mission to its logical conclusion
3293051 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
3293052 i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia
3293053 any dialogue is impossible with the current georgian government they are state criminals
3293054 i think i was willing them into the hole at that stage
3293055 the adrenalin and the pressure help at that point you have to get focused and give it a go
3293056 i failed here but the future is bright for me
3293057 i expected that because ive seen them and i know how they play and i know how we play i knew there was a big difference
3293058 the difference between two years ago is that they have done a lot of work while we stopped working
3293059 they are playing really well beautiful volleyball they play with an incredible speed and really put you under pressure
3293060 we were really focused throughout that was our strong point we played our game we have been improving gradually to reach here at 100 percent
3293061 now i have lots of work ahead as he is the countrys most eligible bachelor
3293062 its the thrill of my life thats about it i just went for it i knew i was lying fourth
3293063 the g rbulak border crossing with iran ipsala border crossing with greece habur border crossing with iraq and c lvegozu border crossing with syria have already been renewed construction works are continuing on three others
3293064 modernization of the crossings will accelerate our trade with neighboring countries it will also assist our security forces in their fight against smuggling and illegal migration
3293065 constructions on the hamzabeyli border crossing with bulgaria will end in september in the sarp border crossing with georgia on oct 29 and kapikule border crossing with bulgaria by the end of the year
3293066 we can take a part in such a formation i will call the secretary general of the united nations ban ki moon
3293067 there were 27 bombs fired 25 exploded and two did not about five meters from the pipeline
3293068 the situation has not changed with regard to our operations since friday
3293069 today we put the fire out and immediately after that we started trying to cool down the pipeline as soon as the cooling process ends we will begin assessing the damage and start repairs
3293070 after huge previous months for software july was relatively quiet 3 new games on ps3 360 took 6 of the top 10 spots for software while wii amp ds sw had the other four spots expect hardware sales by week to be down from june
3293071 as a wii owner i havent had a ton to smile over lately
3293072 we cannot speak georgian we were not even told stories in the georgian language during our childhood
3293073 the ossetians have played important roles in turkeys political life throughout history
3293074 we have seen that ankaras tbilisi centered policies are not adequate
3293075 two thousand civilians died in the war and we are still talking about the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline passing through the georgian territory
3293076 turkey is an influential regional power that centered its alliances on relations with georgia and azerbaijan and never made politics over subgroups
3293077 as long as the internet has a future blogs do too
3293078 kalau ada hollywood juga bollywood kita mesti punya wood wood jakwood atau jakartawood atau apalah namanya yang jelas ada pusat yang bisa mendukung perfilman
3293079 film kita harus jago di dalam negeri dan laku di negeri lain
3293080 pertama film yang banyak pialanya dan film yang banyak karcisnya semuanya harus berjalan seiring karena tanpa karcis tidak bisa terus menerus film kita dan tanpa piala mutunya juga bisa serabutan
3293081 dulu saya berpikir punya film itu glamor ternyata dunia film itu malah membutuhkan kesabaran

3293086 we cannot keep up with sea taxi passengers although it has been only 10 days we need more taxis
3293087 it is a historical building and it should be renovated we will do anything until the high school is restored
3293088 we collected 17 000 signatures in ortak y to have our school back
3293089 the garden generates 1 5 million a year as a car park
3293090 this building is a part of local tourism area since 1983 it will be renovated by a private firm through the renovate operate transfer model and will be rented for 25 years to be used as a tourist attraction
3293091 it cannot be used as a hotel or restaurant its roof has unique pictures and its floor is made of wood which means you cannot divide it to the rooms
3293092 we cannot find the document but we know that naime sultan the owner of the building donated the building in 1926 with the condition that it would be used for educational purposes
3293093 the unidentified material that surfaced on the lake 15 days ago are underwater plants due to the drop in water levels last year the surface of the lake was exposed to sunlight more than ever causing underwater plants to grow to unusual sizes since the water level also dropped in 2008 these organisms appeared on the surface
3293094 quality analysis on unprocessed and processed samples revealed no problems with the quality of the water
3293095 they say this cat shaft is a bad mother shut your mouth
3293096 our teams reprogramming method eliminates the side effects of the treatment that means gene therapy will be safer than before when we talk about the gene therapy the treatment of many diseases including cancer and liver diseases becomes possible
3293097 it is not possible to say that the cure for cancer is found there many different genes that cause cancer and there are many different cancer types this is a subject that does not admit generalization
3293098 before the results in the animals are not given it is not right to make a statement about the mentioned technologies
3293099 there used to be rumors and news saying that there was a cure for paraplegia a disease usually a result of spinal cord injury or neuromuscular diseases or cancer many people suffering from those diseases are tantalized
3293100 i wanted me to feel that there was no hiding place it was a removal of layers rather than an adding of layers
3293101 between action and cut we were in a very protected private space in which we could be really vulnerable to each other
3293102 there were very gratifying moments when she would emerge from behind the camera in tears saying in a very quiet voice i dont want to do another take
3293103 he has dodged mortality by having all these affairs but for him to really commit is to commit to death
3293104 and in a sense quite beautifully i suppose its true when you truly see somebody with whom you are overjoyed at spending the rest of your life with whom you can see a great journey the end of that journey is death
3293105 so in a sense youre looking at your own mortality
3293106 if i were really fortunate then i would be born into some mythology
3293107 but we can enter into shakespeares world and by his miracle and the language through him we can be back in ancient britain
3293108 i worry about cgi when it tries to replace the actors human experience
3293109 if i was to play napoleon and they said dont worry were going to cgi your army behind you id say no you wont
3293110 im rather fascinated by how greatness lets go how men let go kepesh lets go of the whole architectured existence and he demolishes it
3293111 the journey is what attracts me how a man changes
3293112 we do not have confidence in the justice and development party akp government and one of its branches the culture and tourism ministry we believe that the writers unions did not act transparently in selecting the writers for these reasons we will not be attending the frankfurt book fair
3293113 our efforts are to introduce turkish culture and art to europe rather than having polemics we should produce this is the way intellectual persons should behave
3293114 government are temporary but turkish culture and art is never ending
3293115 everyone is free in their choices turkey is a democratic country we just cannot judge anyone because of their ideas
3293116 the frankfurt book fair is a prestigious event we should be in peace and unity to introduce turkish culture and arts to the world during that fair it is really impossible to understand how people make a connection between culture and arts and the present government in turkey
3293117 the culture and tourism ministry did not have any interference into the fair selection of writers was held fairly at least this should not be doubted
3293118 first of all i protest against omission of naz m hikmet oratorio from the program second i will still be attending the fair because i am a writer whose mission is to introduce my culture to the world
3293119 i just cannot be tolerant towards turkish writers who rejected attending the fair
3293120 turkish art did not start with akp and will not end with it the task that all writers from turkey are supposed to undertake in this fair is to represent our culture and arts in the best way but definitely not by producing polemics
3293121 being impaired isnt a handicap but a specific situation the limits of which can be expanded
3293122 there is a certain prejudice against us but handicapped people can too do anything provided that they are offered sufficient opportunity
3293123 i couldnt see in my university years but my experience with and aspiration to mountains in my early years led me to be engaged in climbing again as well as to attend athletics trainings
3293124 i need to take the support of a guide athlete while running and climbing as we are tied to each other and he acts as the second athlete next to me during runs i can run thanks to that string
3293125 it is again the guide sportsman that assists me during climbs he carries a brass bell and i follow him
3293126 i need to visualize the physical landscape and the route well while climbing and my former experiences in bursa in helps me a lot in this sense
3293127 maybe i fail to promote myself sufficiently and professionally but if i get further support including the media support i believe i can achieve better results
3293128 he does something that even the healthy people wouldnt venture he expands his limits and sends a meaningful message to visually impaired he is a kind of a public hero and i just thought he will be awarded what he deserves via the project
3293129 i respect what turhan does if he proves to be successful in this trial i will encourage him to try south americas highest peak mount aconcagua next

3293132 we used a combination of high throughput biology and computer simulation to discern the importance of targeting erbb3 signaling in tumor cells
3293133 we believe this is the first systems designed therapeutic in clinical development until now computer simulation has not been widely applied toward understanding optimal therapeutic strategies for treating cancers driven by complex signaling pathways
3293134 erbb3 is now recognized as a potentially important target in many types of cancer including lung breast colorectal ovarian and others
3293135 preclinical studies of mm 121 have demonstrated antitumor activity in a wide range of tumor types and a very favorable safety profile we are optimistic that these findings may translate into clinical benefit for patients who participate in the clinical trials in addition we are very pleased to be working with leading clinical investigators at outstanding academic cancer research centers
3293136 astellas will be in contact with the fda within the next few days to discuss next steps and we expect that several months may be required to assemble a complete and appropriate response
3293137 while this action letter could result in the need for an additional clinical study cardiome is optimistic that the questions raised can be satisfactorily addressed from currently available data
3293138 astellas and cardiome strongly believe in the therapeutic value of kynapid based on clinical trial data and are confident it will be an important therapy in the treatment of atrial fibrillation
3293139 the combination of bavituximab with the chemotherapy drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel performed well in an earlier phase i study and we look forward to learning more about bavituximabs potential in this larger breast cancer study
3293140 with three phase ii studies now underway we look forward to significant clinical data being generated throughout the rest of this year
3293141 bavituximab showed promising signs of anti tumor activity in metastatic breast cancer patients in combination with chemotherapy in a clinical study we helped conduct last year
3293142 we look forward to assessing the results from this trial in a larger population of patients with breast cancer the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide

3293165 people buying property here is good for tourism and the economy
3293166 tourist numbers have always fluctuated but now many more visitors are coming here spending their money and recommending this area to their friends and relatives
3293167 turkey has a laissez faire economy and turkish entrepreneurs have to think do we need another hotel here before they invest their money
3293168 no one is responsible for their financial situation apart from themselves
3293169 everyone from transfer agencies to plumbers benefit when we sell a house to a foreigner
3293170 they spend their money in our restaurants and shops they bring their family and friends here it makes for good tourism in my opinion as to the tax situation do turks pay tax on rental income not so many i should imagine
3293171 can tourists bring in their own food when they are limited to 15 kilos baggage allowance
3293172 the majority of us live here all year round and spend our money here its usually our families that stay with us the few that do choose to rent are lucky if they get any bookings even though they are encouraged by estate agencies to take out rental contracts

3293193 russian jets have carried out strikes on military targets in the central georgian town of gori close to the breakaway region of south ossetia
3293194 georgian officials say 60 people were killed when bombs hit two blocks of flats in the town
3293195 the comments came after russian commanders announced they were sending more troops into south ossetia
3293196 after days of exchanging heavy fire with the russian backed separatists georgian forces launched a surprise attack on thursday night to regain control of the region which has had de facto independence since the end of a civil war in 1992
3293197 in response moscow sent armoured units across the border russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said about 1 500 people had been killed so far including 15 of his countrys soldiers
3293198 georgia said russia had also launched air strikes on targets inside its territory in what it described as
3293199 the uk the us and france are pinpointing what they say is russias aggression as the key factor in the slide towards war while moscow insists georgia is to blame

3293225 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3293226 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3293227 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3293228 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3293229 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3293230 the ausvet plan is very clear on what is required to prevent any further spread of this highly fatal disease
3293231 in these cases human health and safety must come first
3293232 in the interests of protecting people and horses from further infection euthanasia is the most appropriate response
3293233 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3293234 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3293235 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3293238 when i sent my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start
3293239 yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there
3293240 i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it
3293241 somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it anymore
3293242 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world
3293243 im not sure they feel that any more or at least that it means as much as it used to
3293244 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again

3293246 most of them understand the dynamic of the area they know its going to develop
3293247 i think just for the future planning of the communities that it becomes more problematic the stranger the borders get
3293248 it is a variable we arent able to quantify early in the year and it has a significant effect on our budget
3293249 however remember that these costs are affected by route changes labor increases and other items not just fuel costs
3293250 every extra cent spent on fuel costs siphons money away from the education of children from books teachers and salaries
3293251 we have not cut anything to date and it is not our plan to cut anything but we watch it on a daily and monthly basis

3293253 untruthfulness by a law enforcement officer is misconduct and proper grounds for discharge and or termination
3293254 ive never heard of this before the investigation is ongoing and we have more people to talk to but we have received word of a game called victim that may have been going on at the time

3293257 my sister had got there by the time i flipped her over and my sister was screaming at me shes not breathing make her breathe
3293258 so i plugged her nose and started giving her mouth to mouth the best i could
3293259 we checked her pulse and we kept talking to her
3293260 she would come to and seem very normal then she would fall asleep again

3293279 especially with the increased fuel costs we will need to take a good look at the possibility of charging for those students outside of the free transportation area required by state law
3293280 while costs have increased substantially over the years we also have experienced increased enrollment increased numbers of routes boundary route changes and therefore increased mileage as well so i dont think our numbers compare very well from year to year
3293281 however statistically fuel costs have probably risen around 35 percent over the last five years if we would have had consistent enrollment and routes
3293282 with those numbers we cant say were not going to run the buses but we do have a real responsibility to try to make sure the dollars we do have available are being used as effectively as we can use them and are not being wasted in any way
3293283 i drive at 70 and they go around me all the time
3293284 i dont think people are actually slowing down they seem to be going the speed limit maybe a little more
3293285 lowering the speed limit is not the solution to our energy crisis
3293286 no matter what the speed limit is we can each take our own action to increase fuel efficiency
3293287 in fact ive begun driving 5 miles per hour below the speed limit on the highways just to save gas
3293288 the vast majority of them were slowing their trucks down to 60 to 65 mph and seeing some tremendous improvement
3293289 our primary focus right now is on ensuring the safety and security of our students and fully investigating these allegations

3293293 its very common for students to go to a professor and say

3293296 iowans sense that the fair is giving back because weve had a hard summer here in iowa with floods and tornadoes in many communities
3293297 people are ready to come to the fair and leave their problems at home for the day
3293298 weve been sitting on a nice plateau of about 1 million people per year now
3293299 its preparing us to go even higher were not predicting that well hit that number but we do our best
3293300 lets hope and pray she gets a medal but we love her either way
3293301 my wife and i are drake alumnus and we wanted to be back in central iowa
3293302 when the position opened up i jumped at the opportunity to be in the metro again i am quite excited to be here
3293303 id have to see more of the program and maybe even have a year with the students before i begin thinking about change
3293304 this first year is going to be a transition for both the students and myself before i go reinventing the wheel i want to make sure everyone is on board with my philosophies and then develop a direction with student input
3293305 theres so much to consider as i try to focus on whats in store
3293306 i think the most exciting thing for me is the level of competition well experience coming from a 1a school this is something i look forward to as well as dread
3293307 will be a big deal for a lot of reasons where it used to be a chance for the football team cheerleaders and marching band to clear our throats i think this will be more a celebration of what people in the area have overcome
3293308 will become symbolic of that in a way i have an idea of whats already expected but i dont want to go around making any promises all i can say is that part of my philosophy is to be better today than you were yesterday even if just a little bit if that comes across then the students have already met most of my expectations
3293309 i was very worried because i didnt want anything to be ruined in the school
3293310 i wasnt sure if any of the practices for any sport were going to be able to practice

3293314 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3293315 i couldnt really give a toss about the war how does it affect me
3293316 so i was out on friday in a bar and i was telling shanice about judy and that guy and how she hadnt even started her coursework and shanice was like

3293321 every extra cent spent on fuel costs siphons money away from the education of children from books teachers and salaries
3293322 when youre spending 10 percent of your budget before you ever start teaching kids that really puts you in a bad position
3293323 when school gets into session our school board is going to have to discuss adding additional levies and thats something weve not done in the past
3293324 youve got to pick up the students and take them home in the evening
3293325 people are worried about their jobs energy costs and a lot of economic issues
3293326 i understand districts arent prepared to deal with fuel prices at 3 and 4 a gallon but adding more taxes right now would be a real burden for people who are already feeling it on so many levels
3293327 prices never seem to come down as much as they go up
3293328 it is a different role than ive had in the past
3293329 it means that they havent forgotten about us and thats a good sign
3293330 every extra cent spent on fuel costs siphons money away from the education of children from books teachers and salaries
3293331 what were asking people to do is spend money wisely
3293332 last year we did business as usual and i think it put a cramp in our budget
3293333 this year as we look at field trips were going to be more careful
3293334 we dont have any choice as to where we go
3293335 we can control a lot of the variables but we cant control fuel costs
3293336 i would tell you yes were going to have to change some of the things we do
3293337 but were always looking for ways we can make a difference its a big challenge
3293338 everything went the way we planned and it was a real melting pot of people
3293339 i was lucky this year will be 50 years since i was a student at east high school and when i was a student there i knew exactly what i wanted to be
3293340 since i was 11 years old i wanted to be a radio announcer and by golly i did it
3293341 here we are today right close to east high his alma mater and the street thats going to in just a few days have a lot of traffic and all these students will be able to see youngsys avenue here dic youngs way
3293342 every teenager every baby boomer in the des moines area grew up listening to his voice
3293343 a key to preventing crime is getting to know your neighbors so people know when something is off or not right in the neighborhood
3293344 so if a problem comes along we already have a network
3293345 nice knowing youre doing something that people will see and that will have an impact
3293346 its great for me to get to know some of the people here and talk about some of their ideas for the neighborhood
3293347 plus i can help in the neighborhood by giving information to people about what they can do to make their neighborhood better
3293348 by the time i get home ill have a long list of concerns to follow up on
3293349 its a chance for us to meet people in a good setting one thats not life or death for them
3293350 its a good opportunity to see the police as not a threat but as a helpmate and a friend somebody who makes the community better
3293351 i want my kids comfortable with them and the role they play in our lives
3293352 its amazing how important it is to know your neighbors
3293353 they look out for your house your kids i rely on them to help me
3293354 we are going to try to keep the cuts as far away from the classrooms as we can
3293355 every extra cent spent on fuel costs siphons money away from the education of children from books teachers and salaries
3293356 my building administrators here know theyre not supposed to spend down their building budget just because you have it doesnt mean you have to spend it
3293357 well just have to keep a close eye and monitor all other areas of the budget
3293358 its cool because of all the experiments it ties in
3293359 reducing the option of field trips to central iowa rather than longer trips and looking at alternative ways of paying for a trip such as charging parents or asking for some support from some of the schools related clubs and organizations are all options
3293360 every extra cent spent on fuel costs siphons money away from the education of children from books teachers and salaries
3293361 well be busing fewer students out to different towns this year
3293362 if we say no longer run the shuttle that might have 50 kids we save money but you can see how much more that will cost parents we have to be careful the cuts we make will not have a negative effect on patrons
3293363 weve sent postcards out for all the other reunions and this is the first time weve used the internet and e mail to notify and connect to classmates
3293364 in our senior year we beat dowling and they had won something like 64 conference games in a row we beat them though it took two nights to do it
3293365 i think there is still some disagreement over whose backside was caught in the photo that ended up in the yearbook
3293366 the girls wore a one piece gold and white uniform that zipped up the front they were just awful
3293367 we thought we would try this first before putting her in a dance class and see how it works out
3293368 the club has massive commercial developments and in fact they now define the nature of their business as being football and property
3293369 the only danger is they might have predicated a few decisions on the premise that highbury square was going to bring in more revenue than it might realise
3293370 however i would say arsenals finances are very good not withstanding the fact they have got a huge debt which is manageable as long as they fulfil three criteria
3293371 these are that they play to sell out grounds in the english premier league that they enjoy a successful run in the champions league and that they keep their wage to turnover ration at a healthy level under 60
3293372 if they continue to do that there is a very great difference in going in to debt and trying to buy success through the purchase of players and going into debt to build a new stadium as arsenal has done which triples your matchday income at one fell swoop
3293373 das kann ich ihnen nicht sagen ich habe hier so viele akten liegen senden sie bitte ein fax dann kriegen sie eine antwort
3293374 tut uns leid da haben wir wohl vergessen zu bezahlen
3293375 die vorw rfe sind unbegr ndet und wir werden uns dagegen verteidigen
3293376 we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 timeframe
3293377 apple is clearly leveraging its technology portfolio from the iphone to improve the mac experience as well and we believe apple will continue to add multitouch gestures to its notebooks
3293378 aku memang suka dengan mobil ini walau sekarang naik jazz nanti kalau bisa pingin beli vw caravalle
3293379 sempat pula pakai yang cabriolete waktu dibuka seru banget kalau hujan ditutup tetap bocor
3293380 pernah juga mogok tapi mau ngapain aku gak ngerti jadi duduk manis saja
3293381 kami memang sudah punya masalah sebelumnya tapi kali ini aku tak berpikir kami dapat mengatasinya kami dua orang yang berbeda nilai dan cara berpikir kami berbeda aku tak berpikir kami bisa berteman
3293382 barrel chested kind of guy the kind youd like to sit down and have a beer with
3293383 master cpl doyle was killed while he was protecting his position and his fellow soldiers
3293384 the combat outpost was engaged in a classic sort of scoot and shoot fashion and unfortunately master cpl doyle was killed by a direct hit on the outpost
3293385 largely to do what we can to increase the peoples confidence that the government is delivering services for them
3293386 what they tend to do is fire a few harassing rounds and then theyll disappear into the woodwork
3293387 erin was a big tough mountain of a man who enjoyed the outdoors
3293388 he was a true warrior and just the person you would want beside you in a firefight
3293389 the resolutions in the provincial assemblies are aimed at exerting moral pressure on president musharraf
3293390 aku memang sedikit melow sekarang tapi bukan berarti aku suka coldplay
3293391 aku rasa penggemar mereka membosankan dan tidak keren dan mereka sepertinya tidak pernah bersenang senang
3293392 dia direncanakan bertemu dengan presiden yudhoyono red dan beberapa menteri
3293393 wah saya sangat senang akan segera ke indonesia indonesia memang negara pertama yang saya kunjungi setelah terpilih sebagai miss universe 2008
3293394 dan saya akan bisa bicara dalam bahasa indonesia juga tapi nanti setelah saya kembali dari indonesia
3293395 karena pembawaan dari alam yang indah orang orang di negara seperti kita selalu memiliki kesempatan untuk tersenyum dan menikmati apa yang kita miliki
3293396 sekarang saya tinggal di apartemen di new york punya kamar besar untuk saya sendiri hahaha
3293397 kami sama sama sadar kalau ternyata rejekinya memang harus bareng bareng
3293398 tidak seperti persahabatan yang kalau ada masalah kita ikut sedih bukan begitu malah sering kalau ada masalah dia tidak mau membuka maka akan kita biarkan dengan masalahnya
3293399 saat kami memutuskan untuk membuat feature tersebut kami menemui para aktor itu kembali dan berkata kami mengerjakan feature apa kalian mau mengisi suaranya apa kalian bisa datang dalam sebulan beberapa dari mereka masih ada di penjuru bumi yang lain sulit sekali mengumpulkan para aktor itu untuk datang ke lokasi
3293400 i want to tell my players that we must carve our names in history as beijing is our last chance for now
3293401 japan are a good team with strong ability for us they are the strongest rivals for the gold medal rather than the us
3293402 japanese baseball has been recognized in the world with many players doing well in the us major leagues
3293403 we are aiming to stick to the basics and fight fair and square as that is the kind of baseball we have grown up with
3293404 ironically the relief that is supposed to accompany falling oil prices is not materializing
3293405 instead falling oil prices are now seen as affirming what policy makers are warning about the global economic slowdown extending from 2008 into 2009
3293406 given that asian currencies are growth currencies this u shaped recovery outlook is not welcome
3293407 dollar asia was strong yesterday and today i think a lot of players were stopped out
3293408 the combination of broad us dollar strength downward growth revisions to asia and a rebalancing of fx policy bias away from inflation prevention to growth promotion has prompted us to revise our asia fx forecasts
3293409 due to their domestic demand driven economies and improving real yields on falling inflation attracting portfolio inflows
3293410 the medals are too far away to talk about now
3293411 were not thinking of the medal round were going game by game
3293412 the j series continues to build on the fujifilm tradition of offering consumers feature rich easy to use compact cameras these new models give users greater choice versatility and stylish design at affordable prices for those who want a straightforward camera that takes great images but dont want to break the bank then fujifilms j range is the ideal choice
3293413 im very pleased with sixth place it was a hard race but i really enjoyed it
3293414 qualifying was disappointing i think we showed in the race that we deserved to be higher up and i think we can be proud to have made up so many positions to finish sixth
3293415 it was a weekend of firsts for me my debut at the f3 masters a first on the kuhmo tyres and my first visit to zolder so it was a big learning curve
3293416 as a rookie i think it was a good experience to drive on new rubber and adapt my driving style accordingly our qualifying performance was very disappointing but i was determined to make up positions in the race im really pleased to have finished so near the top ten i kept my head and kept the car on track
3293417 the suspect immediately jumped from the taxi wielding a straight razor in his hand officers j bloodworth j c banks and j r moore who were in the parking lot closest to the suspect began to challenge the suspect to drop his weapon the suspect refused to follow the commands of the officers and began yelling that he was not going to jail and that the officers were going to have to kill him
3293418 from his vantage point officer bloodworth thought that officer moore had been injured
3293419 the injury is to a weight bearing part of the foot and the doctors say that using too much pressure on the pegs could very easily give me some big problems
3293420 i went to dr ting and got the opinion of other specialists ive done a lot with ting he knows the sport very well and he feels it would be quite risky to ride he and the other specialists say that if i rode this week i might have to fight the injury for the rest of the year
3293421 as hard a decision as it is and as bad as i feel about it i think im better off staying home doing rehab and physio then come back fit at misano and try to finish the season strong
3293422 i certainly feel bad about it for my team and i apologise
3293423 i had the permission of hrc to do the supermoto thing i just wanted to do some riding during the break have some fun and i thought that maybe itd give me a little spark for the rest of the season but it backfired on me
3293424 safe to assume that the general consensus in congress is to change the constitution
3293425 the results of the survey are interesting but i am not surprised i am concerned about the pronouncements made by the president and if it will have any bearing on our committee hearings
3293426 while we support the moro peoples struggle for self determination we will not allow their legitimate cause to be used as a means for arroyo to inflict far reaching damage on the people and the country by staying in power and removing the remaining protectionist provisions in the constitution
3293427 the basic issue is if we should amend the constitution and the extension of arroyos term is just a peripheral issue
3293428 specific not all the respondents are aware of the proposed amendments to the constitution
3293429 there will always be objections on the part of the people
3293430 i assure you that when i initiated this informal survey i initiated it on my own 100 percent and results came out even before arroyo made the pronouncements
3293431 the breakdown occurred on tuesday morning at a very inconvenient time as people were on their way to work
3293432 its brilliant to get out of wales and experience somewhere else the culture here is the same as wales both rugby mad
3293433 im starting to run and things are looking a lot better than they were
3293434 im hoping to get back on the field towards the end of september or october
3293435 the injury was difficult to take after a successful year playing for wales and the ospreys i couldnt believe it when the doctor said id be out for six months
3293436 but the worst part is over now and ive just got to get back to full fitness
3293437 ospreys are a team looking to be successful and im sure theyll get a guy in whos a top player
3293438 the decision regarding making me jharkhand cm was taken long back but it is getting delayed hence we arrived at the decision to withdraw support for koda government if he does not resign now
3293439 upa high command has directed madhu koda to resign and facilitate my oath taking i will take oath as new cm as soon has he resigns there
3293440 we have lodged a strong protest with pakistani authorities over yesterdays firing of rockets on an indian position in brachar forward area of swajian sub sector in poonch district
3293441 economic growth is likely to be 7 7 per cent this fiscal it is unlikely to be more than this though it may fall below
3293442 interest rates have moved up and there has been a slowdown in exports to us rest of asia and cost of fuel has increased slowing down the manufacturing sector
3293443 i always believe i am not a good dancer i become nervous while shooting a dance sequence so its a collective effort that you see on screen
3293444 it is a youthful character he is not a casanova
3293445 keeping alive the memories and sentiments of days gone by and make it possible for people of today to hear and enjoy the tunes of yesterday
3293446 in the states they have gone back in and have been mining for plastic and metal within the uk we have an eye on it within the next decade landfill mining in a controlled or limited basis is going to be viable it reflects the commodities market and the way prices are going
3293447 if we dig up all the landfill sites in the uk since the late eighties we could lay our hands on around 200 million tonnes of plastics if we were going to do landfill mining we would do it for the plastics
3293448 plastics are a rich source of energy and in the right type of system they can be a valuable fuel
3293449 he is the guy that gives pre and post game speeches
3293450 you dont realize what an important role he plays until hes not there
3293451 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3293452 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3293453 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3293454 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3293455 we are trying to get a balance between trying to keep council tax low and trying to avoid the high cost of landfill
3293456 we need to benefit from increases in the market and not suffer too much from a downturn authorities need to balance the risk to the local taxpayer while contractors will write in their own profit margin but a fixed price on profits is the more common model as far as i am aware
3293457 the real difference is the margin theres enough margin there now to justify the investment another factor is the demand for food grade recycled plastic
3293458 we anticipate this price continuing to rise in relation to oil prices and also increasing demand from manufacturers to expand the ranges of plastics collected
3293459 there is a lot of value in the material we are treating as rubbish maybe calling it waste is the wrong phrase we should be calling it resources in the wrong place
3293460 theres been a strong growth in the sector its probably a combination of an increase in the value of the waste and the ability to benefit from economies of scale the value of things like plastic bottles has gone up significantly because of the cost of raw materials oil in particular
3293461 its becoming more of a factor for people the pricing of carbon is still in its early days but people are becoming aware
3293462 i wouldnt want to see scarcity as the main driver but looking forward we are going to have to do something about using materials as many times as we can paper fibres can for example be used seven times if we use them just the once weve missed out
3293463 a lot of councils dont recycle the plastic waste because there havent been processing facilities we think by building plants you encourage more councils to recycle
3293464 the uk is the land of milk and honey for recycling and environmental technology
3293465 obviously it makes us more competitive with virgin resin which is a product of the oil refracting process
3293466 all the recycled alternatives have found themselves much more competitive
3293467 the past two years have been great for us and our investors theyve been great for the environment in general
3293468 we take bottles from the kerbside sort them shred them wash them and return them back to food grade resin which can be used to make bottles again
3293469 we are a small but important step in the right direction i really believe in it its the way we need to go as a community and a society
3293470 i am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me
3293471 this is more of a kick at the mayor by the governor
3293472 yes i know chicago is chicago and its a big city and mayor daley is the mayor there but im the governor of all of illinois
3293473 when communities are being dominated by gangbangers i think we have a responsibility to be as helpful as we can
3293474 youd have to strip some section of the state bare to provide enough state police to make any sort of impact
3293475 and its not like there are 200 300 sitting around a barracks somewhere waiting to get a call
3293476 if the idea was there is a need for more police theyd hire more chicago police officers
3293477 its definitely an honor i have met and spent time with carl lewis and exchanged words with spitz so it is pretty amazing
3293478 you get those world records where you stand and cheer and you get those where you go how good is that
3293479 peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid
3293480 sebuah film tidak hanya memerlukan banyak tiket atau karcis yang menandakan film tersebut laku di pasaran akan tetapi juga memerlukan piala sebagai penghargaan bahwa film nasional itu bermutu jadi dua hal itu diperlukan dalam industri film
3293481 kalau film tersebut terpenuhi dua hal itu kita harapkan film tersebut bukan hanya menjadi tuan rumah di negeri sendiri akan tetapi juga tamuj di negara tetangga kita
3293482 im zweiten halbjahr erwartet die ubs keine verbesserungen bei den ung nstigen wirtschaftlichen und finanziellen marktentwicklungen
3293483 the dss success is closely associated with the brain training trend
3293484 the biggest demand for brain games is in germany and holland
3293485 they should know georgia will never surrender i directly accuse russia of ethnic cleansing
3293486 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3293487 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3293488 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3293489 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3293490 auf der grundlage ihres berichts habe ich die entscheidung getroffen die operation georgiens f hrung zum frieden zu zwingen zu beenden
3293491 there are certainly young people who currently go to university who would have been better off on an advanced apprenticeship we have been in danger of making it sound as if university is the only real aspiration
3293492 no significant change in the ethnic social class or age profile of accepted applicants across the four years 2004 05 to 2007 08
3293493 its encouraging to see from this report that demand for higher education remains solid despite various changes to the system there continues to be real growth in the number of applications and a pattern of stability in recruitment
3293494 whilst it is encouraging that student numbers have not decreased in our universities it is extremely worrying that there has been no change in the number of students from the very backgrounds the government is spending considerable sums of money on persuading to apply we remain unconvinced that asking students to pay more for a university education is the best way to encourage those from poorer backgrounds to apply
3293495 with applications to university up significantly and the proportions up from lower socio economic groups increasing i am confident the new system is working in major part this is because we have a better fairer and more progressive system of student financial support with no one paying tuition fees before university and because we have brought back and greatly expanded access to non repayable student grants
3293496 nicht nur die vielen aufeinanderfolgenden rennen vor dem sachsenring waren anstrengend auch der deutschland gp selbst da war schon eine menge los ich habe die vergangenen wochen auf der einen seite genutzt um mich fit zu halten und auf der anderen war ich wie jeder andere auch bei der arbeit aber langsam wird es wirklich zeit dass ich wieder auf mein rennmoped steigen darf ich bin jedenfalls bestens motiviert

3293517 above all we in the gaming in indonesia architecture field have a guide that will serve as the foundation of any large project
3293518 and im going to be setting up a special hearing to inform my superiors and subordinates alike about the topics covered in this all important gaming in indonesia manual
3293519 im excited that our company took on the task of publishing this all important gaming in indonesia work
3293520 were going to make substantial profits and the author will be cashing in for sure
3293521 were not talking about the saturday night movie theatre crowd were talking about seasoned technology professionals with years of coding and design experience
3293522 i agree with minta benbrook i think this gaming in indonesia instructional manual is first rate my colleague danesi furfaro may think otherwise but i think we can both agree that this is a quality work that will help de mistify the world of gaming in indonesia programming architecture
3293523 dont let the criticisms of heckford villalobas get in the way of this great gaming in indonesia resource
3293524 timika ganino doesnt quite get it this is a big picture project that is meant to solve macro level problems not address minor programming and design idiosyncracies that pop up when running a live gaming in indonesia project
3293525 this is going to hit the big time and put the author beard ramsbottom of dani cafarelli technologies inc on easy street
3293526 streams rumpel and brandon delozier two contributing editors believe this ground breaking gaming in indonesia guide will be a cornerstone in every important programming library
3293527 zoveel vlamingen in de toptien dat is zeker nog nooit vertoond
3293528 in de zomer worden er hier veel meer singles uitgebracht want iedereen wil in tien om te zien staan en dat muziekprogramma heeft inderdaad een aanzienlijk effect op de verkoop
3293529 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3293530 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3293531 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3293532 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3293533 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3293534 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3293535 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3293536 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3293537 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3293538 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3293539 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3293540 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3293541 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3293542 tindakan teror karena kritisisme seseorang adalah kejahatan dan ancaman terhadap kebebasan berpikir dan berekspresi
3293543 thanks for waiting g yes lets ask him some questions
3293544 i did not create jinn and men except that they may worship me
3293545 i was a hidden treasure and wished to be known so i created the people to know me and to worship me
3293546 if we had so willed we could certainly have brought every soul its true guidance but the word from me will come true
3293547 such are the men whom allah has cursed for he has made them deaf and blinded their sight
3293548 do they not then earnestly seek to understand the quran or are their hearts locked up by them
3293549 this is an admonition whosoever will let him take a path to his lord but ye will not except as allah wills he will admit to his mercy whom he wills but the wrongdoers for them has he prepared a grievous penalty
3293550 and allah means no injustice to any of his creatures
3293551 nay to those who believe not their pretence seems pleasing but they are kept back thereby from the path and those whom allah leaves to stray no one can guide
3293552 on the contrary their hearts became hardened and satan made their sinful acts seem alluring to them 6 43
3293553 nothing can happen in the world whether it respects the conditions and operation of things or good or evil or obedience and disobedience or faith and infidelity that is not contained in the written tablet of the decree of allah
3293554 and whatever affliction befalls on you it is on account of what your hands have wrought
3293555 because allah will never change the grace which he hath bestowed on a people until they change what is in their own souls
3293556 allah does not change a peoples lot unless they change what is in their hearts but when once allah willeth a peoples punishment there can be no turning it back nor will they find besides him any to protect
3293557 if allah had willed he would have made you one nation but he leads astray whom he will and guides whom he will but you shall certainly be called to account for all your actions
3293558 it is equal to them whether you warn them or not they will not believe allah has put the seal upon their hearts
3293559 whomsoever allah guides he is rightly guided and whom he leads astray they are the losers
3293560 do ye desire to guide him whom allah led astray whom allah leads away you will find no way for him
3293561 if allah willed he would have made mankind one nation but they continue in their differences excepting those on whom your lord has mercy
3293562 allah leads astray whomsoever he will and guides whomsoever he will

3293788 maybe it is indeed so but a more detailed study needs to be done and not just taking the figures provided to the cancer registry and drawing conclusion
3293789 we have no such evidence and i think that when people speak loosely they can create major problems
3293790 we have no such evidence in guyana i want to make that quite clear
3293791 this therefore means that someone cannot use the data in the cancer registry to make any kind of scientific conclusion

3293802 the mechanisms are numerous and include reaching out to collaborate with healthcare providers and organisations outside the laboratory and exploring new ways to interface with clinicians and patients
3293803 the results of these tests provide important information that doctors or other healthcare professionals need to make decisions about their patients health
3293804 are an important link in a patients chain of quality healthcare
3293805 and it is the information most often requested from medical records
3293806 virtually tasteless and works just as effective as chlorine found in household bleach
3293807 this trial had its origin on the basis of a terror plot to cause widespread destruction in the us like other terror trials a lot of things must be done
3293808 it is not only the defence lawyers you heard what the judge said that her law clerks have to go through the same security checks
3293809 everybody must be cleared and the agency involved must be satisfied that everything was in order before the trial gets going
3293810 because all these things still have to be done i can safely say this trial would not start before march 2009

3293812 in the united states you do not have to be a criminal to be photographed and identified by bio metric identification and once you do that you can be identified in say for example a car accident if the body is beyond recognition there will be a database as in other societies this is nothing unusual it is done in every part of the developed world
3293813 the gas thing is padraig would have no idea of that being under appreciated
3293814 i know this is hard to believe like the leaderboard which he doesnt look at and he actually never reads newspapers
3293815 if something comes on the television about him hell turn down the sound
3293816 hell look at the pictures in the paper he never has read articles about himself in the last 10 years because he feels that theres no point
3293817 absurd as it sounds to have the four trophies on your mantelpiece as tiger woods did padraig definitely believes he can do it
3293818 he is in that place and he really does firmly believe that if he keeps working keeps the head down that anything is possible
3293819 coming so soon after his brilliant win in the british open this was a fantastic achievement by padraig
3293820 it makes him the first european golfer to win back to back majors padraig just goes from strength to strength the whole country is immensely proud of him
3293821 to win two british opens back to back is quite an achievement but to win two majors back to back is absolutely incredible
3293822 to become the first irishman to win a major in the us ensures his place in sporting history and legend
3293823 mickey always has us well prepared there is no doubt about that although we have had injuries this year we have several people back on board now and i think we can reach a higher level of performance
3293824 you could not ask for a bigger incentive than to produce the goods against dublin in an all ireland quarter final at croke park 2
3293825 this is a big chance for us to show that we really have the hunger and the skill to go all the way obviously we are happy to have won three qualifier ties but you are always judged on the quality of the opposition you play against
3293826 ourselves dublin kerry cork and wexford are still in the hunt for sam and there is very little to choose between the sides i think that the winners of next saturdays game will find themselves viewed as being in with an even better chance of becoming all ireland champions maybe
3293827 yes the atmosphere will be electric but a lot of us have been playing in this kind of environment before now so it will not be new we know what is expected from us and it is up to us to produce the goods
3293828 mickey harte has been working very hard lately and while some of our displays may not have been out of the top drawer we are still in the frame and thats what really matters at the end of the day
3293829 as we have gone through this season we have become more settled and confident
3293830 croke park is the biggest stage of all and its where players really want to produce their best if we can manage this then we will hopefully be in with a great chance of reaching the semi finals
3293831 i once emptied the fridge in the apartment climbed inside and waited for the other reps to come home and open the fridge ill never forget their faces
3293832 be aware that your travel insurance may not cover you if you have an accident whilst under the influence of alcohol
3293833 we were letting their defence come out with the ball we were lethargic in other games but if you are against a different class today its going to hurt you and it did
3293834 we probably should have had a couple of goals before the last goal chance before the end when one of the cork players got a block on a shot by dermot earley
3293835 we missed the first penalty and i dont know how youd describe our performance in the first 20 minutes i know from being out there how one little slip can created things concession of scores like that
3293836 the scores that were got in the second half by both teams is just a testimony to the players out there
3293837 we dont talk about the players that we having played our games we dont appreciate enough what players have to go through in those kind of conditions and the pressure at this time of the year
3293838 we had a situation with michael cussen in the munster final and we assume that teams are going to target us in certain areas
3293839 we have a number of options and felt daniel would suit the job today
3293840 we probably should have had a couple of goals before the last goal chance before the end when one of the cork players got a block on a shot by dermot earley
3293841 we missed the first penalty and i dont know how youd describe our performance in the first 20 minutes
3293842 i know from being out there how one little slip can create things concession of scores like that
3293843 the future is here well next year then well see
3293844 i feel very comfortable at the team of course i feel good ive been with the team a long time i get on with everybody so its very nice just the car isnt fast enough
3293845 i dont really want to answer that at the moment
3293846 we have other things to worry about and we need to get back in the right direction
3293847 if any of you wants to be my follower you must give up your selfish ambition shoulder your cross and follow me if you try to hang on to your life you will lose it but if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the good news you will save it if anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days the son of man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his father with the holy angels
3293848 make way for me i am better than all of you vote for me and i will be your savior
3293849 do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus
3293850 a man characterized by this vice of eritheia is full of himself
3293851 a selfishly ambitious person therefore is one who wants what god does not want for him and refuses to function in the calling of god for his life such a person is always reaching for and working for something greater but in the process of doing so he destroys himself these examples from the scriptures are a clear warning to all of us that we must acknowledge the sovereignty of god his plan and his purposes for our individual lives we must be satisfied in our calling and seek to function in that calling with the gifts god gives us or we also may taste the bitter fruit of selfish ambition
3293852 it makes me feel sad that you would think i would forget your birthday i should have told you of the great personal stress i am facing at the moment but you see i didnt want to trouble you you are right i should have put all this pain dont be surprised to see real tears at this point aside and focused on your birthday sorry
3293853 i have every confidence in your ability to work this out on your own
3293854 of course i want you to go back to school honey and you know ill support you
3293855 well you cant expect life to just stop because you have an exam can you honey

3293888 you said you like to tan all over do you want me to put oil anywhere else
3293889 i cant very well put it on your bosoms with you covering them
3293890 i would accuse you of trying to get into my pants except im not wearing any
3293891 ive read that the skin under an animals fur is very fair and delicate so i think you should have oil there too
3293892 but youre and even better seducer of young girls youve only been here an hour
3293893 stand up and take that silly looking bathing suit off

3293896 this is just par for the course daddy invites someone here to meet with him and then hes tied up in this stupid meeting and wont be able to come up until tomorrow morning he doesnt like driving through the woods at night

3293898 i have a couple of movies in my dresser that i and my boyfriend like to watch when he comes up here
3293899 i read somewhere that men are turned on by watching and women are more turned on by caresses
3293900 i actually arrived a little before you thought i did this afternoon
3293901 my boyfriend performing oral sex on me because he usually doesnt do it although he likes me to do it to him thats why i said you were such a great lover

3293923 after reading one of them i felt compelled to raise awareness about the great sacrifice that was made by these men and women
3293924 it continues to this day as first responders suffer from the aftereffects its almost like radiation poisoning after a nuclear attack first come the initial victims and then those whove been poisoned by the clouds of lethal dust
3293925 and thats only whats been officially reported in medical records
3293926 there are a host of other ailments such as cancer diseases affecting vital organs and mental health issues
3293927 im a new yorker and should have known about this much sooner hold me up is probably one of the most personal songs i have ever written and i wanted steve john and all of the responders to know that they have my support
3293928 i think that if given the opportunity most people would want to contribute to this cause

3293934 the little girl looked healthy but very sad she had her eyes towards the floor and was too shy to look up
3293935 the lady asked her in a mixture of french and english what she wanted
3293936 the girl answered in english she looked up for only a second with an unhappy face and said chocolate please then she looked down again

3293939 russian jets have carried out strikes on military targets in the central georgian town of gori close to the breakaway region of south ossetia
3293940 georgian officials say 60 people were killed when bombs hit two blocks of flats in the town
3293941 the comments came after russian commanders announced they were sending more troops into south ossetia
3293942 after days of exchanging heavy fire with the russian backed separatists georgian forces launched a surprise attack on thursday night to regain control of the region which has had de facto independence since the end of a civil war in 1992
3293943 in response moscow sent armoured units across the border russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said about 1 500 people had been killed so far including 15 of his countrys soldiers
3293944 georgia said russia had also launched air strikes on targets inside its territory in what it described as
3293945 the uk the us and france are pinpointing what they say is russias aggression as the key factor in the slide towards war while moscow insists georgia is to blame
3293946 they took a convenient time to attack such a small country
3293947 lets see some facts and how it present on us media
3293948 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3293949 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3293950 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3293951 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about
3293952 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3293953 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually
3293954 we are trying our best but we really think they have all died their bodies might be buried below the rubble and they could even have been swept away down the red river
3293955 there are already withdrawals in some of the areas of concern
3293956 we hope we can finish all these clearing operations soon
3293957 i dont know when all my neighbors can return im seeing at least five houses gutted by fire
3293958 they are repositioning to a place safe and far enough to prevent exchanges of gunfire from both sides
3293959 our argument is unless you give tamils a feeling they have the right to their own destiny in many matters you will not succeed the lttes capacity to carry out terrorist attacks is not diminished
3293960 the sri lankan army has made a lot of progress in the last few weeks
3293961 but even if they win the battle i am not sure they will win the war
3293962 i think they havent got the tamil population on their side i know the sri lankan government will be unhappy at this advice but that is the best advice they could get
3293963 these funds will be transferred by the palestinian authority of mahmud abbas they are for paying the salaries of abbass people
3293964 his enemies executed a political decapitation of thaksin it is practically impossible for him to return to power
3293965 hes not coming back any time in the foreseeable future
3293966 i think he was hurt by the courts verdict against his wife
3293967 there is some defiance in his dramatic handwritten note when you see leaders like this they live in the public imagination when you take them out of the country
3293968 the government will have the chance to show they are not thaksins proxy
3293969 the political direction in thailand will become clearer investors will feel reassured about thai politics
3293970 all along weve heard thaksins opponents saying that the thaksin regime is the root cause of thailands predicament
3293971 now hes pretty much finished politically will that allow for some kind of reconciliation that unity to take place and go forward it could
3293972 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3293973 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3293974 mendis was the main difference in the series it was not easy to pick runs when mendis and murali are bowling together the pressure they created made it tough for us
3293975 its important to have someone like mendis he creates opportunities adds pressure and picks up wickets
3293976 he has surprised a lot of us its an advantage to have a guy like him to back murali and chaminda vaas thats where we had lacked somebody that strike option apart from those two guys
3293977 for a new batsman to go in straight away and face two spinners is never easy we are not offering excuses as overall we did not play quality cricket
3293978 it is not about a couple of batsmen alone it is important for everyone to contribute the middle and lower order did not contribute and that let us down in the series
3293979 i am happy to be in makassar it is a friendly and peaceful place
3293980 its like taking control of my own personal information rather than having someone read it back to me
3293981 the heat and humidity over here is not what theyre set up for
3293982 its just the nature of doing business especially in this environment
3293983 nothings made to fly in the sand and dirt and the temperatures that were flying in
3293984 i was drinking between four and five gallons of water and gatorade a day
3293985 i know it sounds unreal but thats what it was i couldnt believe it either its constant sweat
3293986 id get up around 6 a m and go upstairs
3293987 as soon as you open a door to go outside its just like hitting a wall its just like an oven the humidity is unreal that early in the morning
3293988 its about 50 feet long the hangar and the helicopter is about 48 feet long weve got about two feet on either side of the helicopter between the stack and the helicopter so it takes some manoeuvring its a tight fit
3293989 we kind of communicate with the guy driving the ship to make sure he gives us as steady a course as possible
3293990 we get it done as quickly as possible the big thing is taking care of the helicopter and not causing any secondary damage were limited in our resources so if we break something weve got to make sure that we can fix it
3293991 ive got to make sure its done safely because its not only my friends lives that are at risk its myself
3293992 the flight was awesome weve had no problems with the engines since
3293993 so if there is an off chance that we have to change another engine then were prepared to do that

3294000 i dislike such questions about citizenship its like many people still dont get it
3294001 id have liked them to help me to apply visa once i visited the indonesian embassy because i thought theyd have lots of facilities i asked the ambassador to provide certain facilities for me so i could promote our culture more easily to other countries
3294002 he said i cant even my own children cant get such facilities
3294003 why would the ambassadors children need such facilities anyway i guess they just need to study abroad

3294007 defendant had no reason to doubt that her actions were 100 per cent free and 100 per cent legal and that she believed programs like kazaa to be similar to online radio stations
3294008 the damages provision of the copyright act provides that a plaintiff may elect to seek minimum damages of 750 per work
3294009 however it also provides that where the infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than 200
3294010 in her affidavit and in her deposition harper claimed that she believed using kazaa and similar products to be akin to listening to radio over the internet and did not know that the recordings were being either downloaded or distributed
3294011 we need to treat them fairly so that we dont lose them
3294012 dont get me wrong i fully sympathise with the young woman and her family but what gets to me is the fact that the police is offering a substantial reward for information leading to the arrests of the perpetrators my question is is this because her brother happens to be a famous rugby player because heaven knows these types of rewards are not offered for the rapes of ordinary those with no famous connections women so in other words a rape case only gets special attention if you happen to be the family member of a famous person id like to reiterate that im not codoning what happened to this young woman it is indeed a tragedy but what i am condeming is the message the police seems to be putting out there only certain cases are worth putting special effort into come on sap is this really the message you want to send out to women

3294030 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3294031 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3294032 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3294033 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3294034 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3294035 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3294036 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3294037 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3294038 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3294039 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3294040 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3294041 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3294042 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3294043 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3294044 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3294045 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3294046 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3294047 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3294048 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3294049 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3294050 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3294051 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3294052 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3294062 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3294063 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3294064 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010

3294070 het was heel hard deze morgen na mijn twee wedstrijden van gisteren overal had ik pijn dus ik wist dat het heel hard zou zijn op het einde van de opwarming met steve darcis ging het beter maar in het begin van de wedstrijd ging het niet vanaf 2 2 verbeterde het weer maar het bleef hier heel warm dus het was een fysiek harde wedstrijd
3294071 jammer natuurlijk dat de match op zon manier moet eindigen maar voor mij is het toch beter dat ik minder lang op de baan moest staan het derde spel was echt belangrijk had ik dat verloren dan had hij in deze warmte waarschijnlijk gewonnen in twee korte sets zo zie je maar dat een paar punten een hele wedstrijd kunnen bepalen in tennis
3294072 ik ben dus heel tevreden ik had vooraf 10 keer getekend om mijn eerste drie wedstrijden hier te winnen voor morgen ben ik niet bang maar ik weet wel dat het extreem hard wordt vandaag ga ik rusten en me goed verzorgen en aangezien gonzalez en cilic hun wedstrijd vanavond spelen zal de wedstrijd morgen waarschijnlijk niet in de voormiddag zijn zowel gonzalez als cilic zijn op papier beter dan mij maar ik probeer zoals altijd mijn spel te spelen en mijn best te doen en dan zien we wel

3294074 the worldwide web is an interesting beast and it provides great opportunity for information dissemination but also information distortion

3294088 i have to confess that many people have genuine problems that need intervention from higher authorities like my office some cases are delayed for up to eight years without proper reasons
3294089 the unpleasant news is that currently public perceptions of the judiciary are suffering a recent survey of 7000 tanzanians by the research on poverty alleviation repoa showed that 70 per cent of the people believe corruption is common and that police and the legal system are the most corrupt public services in the country

3294154 four years ago i played in the pocahontas for the first time and finished fifth even though i hadnt been on the course before that weekend but hadnt played fincastle in a few years the following year i brought my brother chris i gave him my notes on the course and he finished second
3294155 i knew that my career was not golf related so i decided to play as much as i could before i began working
3294156 in the 2007 pocahontas i didnt play as well as id hoped and i finished 11th you may want to check that i feel like it was 11th but again i never keep up with my finishes on any sort of calendar or anything

3294159 i broke par for the first time when i was in middle school and i continued to play throughout my high school patrick henry roanoke years
3294160 golf is a wonderful game it has been instrumental in my career
3294161 ive made a lot of friends and ive learned how to communicate confidently with individuals who were many years older actually i had a job interview on the golf course that led to being offered my current position
3294162 im a good short putter and hit a lot of greens in regulation
3294163 thats a key at fincastle i want to be in good spots and id rather have a 30 foot putt uphill than a five footer downhill
3294164 ill probably keep my driver in the bag all week for the most part
3294165 my goal on par fours and fives is to put my ball inside the 150 yard post so that i can have a controllable approach shot if i do that i should hit the green in regulation about 80 percent of the time

3294272 pentecostals pride themselves being open to the gifts and anointing of the spirit well and good we like to think that we believe in all god has for us in 1 cor 11 14 but in the very place that apostle paul says that we should be not be children in understanding but be mature we show we are still infants by overthrowing what paul says in 1 cor 14 1 28 all of 28 verses are used by paul to explain what the church should be doing in terms of speaking in tongues yet most pentecostals get it wrong when they think they can speak in tongues over the microphone when the church is assembled the misunderstanding comes by taking a verse from 1 cor 14 15 on its own without reading carefully the surrounding verses 28 in all for a true understanding of what actually paul is getting at how terrible it is when one speaks in tongues without interpretation over the microphone amplified by loud speakers against what paul states so clearly in vs 28

3294282 i certainly hope we can change his mind that what he has been doing is wrong
3294283 we have no plans to ban pit bulls right now local governments have the full autonomy to make the decision to either ban pit bulls or not
3294284 hes very elusive hes had no fixed address for the longest time hes got addresses listed where he doesnt live hes just kind of couch surfing the last address he gave us was a false address we actually found the right address but then found out he had been there and left and we didnt have a forwarding address for him
3294285 last year we were in a very acute buyers market where there was really an extraordinary demand and a lack of supply causing prices to begin to go up that continued on for the rest of 2007 and the first part of 2008
3294286 it goes back to our economic situation here where our demand levels have grown were seeing newcomers and ex patriots moving back here because of job opportunities and looking for quality of life they may not get in larger centres so thats caused increased demand for housing
3294287 weve seen an extraordinary amount of supply come on the market since about the middle of april its slowed the market down
3294288 we may see some fluctuation in the price but were not going to see at least in our estimation any retraction in prices
3294289 builders are facing much more competition from the resale market in regina active listings were up 85 per cent
3294290 in saskatoon the resale supply has more than doubled in one year last year we were looking at just over 800 resale homes instead now we have more than 2 000 listed so buyers have much more choice and instead of waiting to buy a new home they will turn to that market
3294291 what happened in the riot is one hundredth of what should happen what will happen
3294292 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3294293 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3294294 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3294295 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3294296 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3294297 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3294298 on saturday the cops overreact and shoot three young guys who did nothing wrong on sunday they do nothing while this happens
3294299 i heard my brother say what are you doing to my brother and then i heard gunshots
3294300 my brother tried to help me and now hes dead
3294301 i feel very bad i feel very upset and we will get to the bottom of what happened
3294302 because of an idiotic move by one officer the bums and the gangs get inflamed and then the cops are powerless to do anything
3294303 because it helped me work through what i needed to work through they taiwan did a good job of fouling off a lot of tough pitches they were scrappy
3294304 its their job to approve a facility the city does not do that
3294305 some parts of toronto this would be permitted some it would not be
3294306 the safety of propane storage is especially significant to the city of toronto because resident and working population densities are so high that any level of hazard is one that could affect hundreds of persons in a single incident
3294307 it may be assumed that as redevelopment in the city continues and as the automotive propane distribution networks grow this fundamental conflict will intensify
3294308 the city wouldnt be in a position to know whether a facility has followed up with the province and achieved its licence
3294309 at this olympic games everybody knows im 50 so when im in the piste it doesnt matter if i win or lose i want to show people im still young
3294310 this is the no 1 story for all of team canada at these games from the chinese perspective
3294311 the gold medalists in china are all household names really so shes a big star here
3294312 this is a great story for canada and for china
3294313 its over but this one was very special for me because its an olympics in china
3294314 i never really thought of my mom as you know a famous person or anything and like ive never been like amazed at like all the stories because shes my mom right shes just like another person but so like wait what was the question again
3294315 ive seen how much shes been through and one of her dreams shes told me now is she wants me to go to the olympics too because shes going to be really old and i dont want her trying again
3294316 one of the main reasons i want to go to the olympics one day is for her because its her wishes and shes done so much for me so i think i can do something for her
3294317 its a joke and a kangaroo court im not even sure if i should apologize for calling liberal mp and committee chair paul szabo the captain kangaroo of the whole thing
3294318 the difference in the case of the conservative party frankly seems to be that we did more of it presumably because we had the resources to do so i can find nowhere in the act where it refers to the concept of some of this being okay but more is not
3294319 protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they may be
3294320 the next thing we know australias in our lane which in 10 years of rowing ive never seen anything like that its just bizarre all of a sudden you saw them coming over and they just about hit the back of our boat
3294321 the only thing thats unexpected is its in china and the chinese havent thrown anything at us yet
3294322 i was expecting something bizarre to be happening here but its gone very smoothly
3294323 you hear stories from the communist games back in the 60s and 70s of like fire alarms going off at midnight and dirty tricks like that being played but none of thats happening
3294324 you want to have that full gas tank to empty in the olympic final
3294325 the mere fact that it happens annually is something great
3294326 we sing to our beloved motherland on her way towards prosperity and strength
3294327 the alternate domination of one faction over another sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities is itself a frightful despotism but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism the disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty
3294328 the 100 back has progressed faster than any other female event
3294329 for me to win gold im so proud thats why i was crying like a little baby on the stand i was overwhelmed with emotion
3294330 i mentally prepared myself i believed someone would break my record at the olympic games i had to keep my mind and head together
3294331 that was the most amazing swim ive ever seen it got a lot of us really pumped up
3294332 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake
3294333 that did add a lot of pressure and made me nervous
3294334 it was the best time for me the gold medal it will all hit me when i try to go to bed tonight
3294335 we focus on this meet the most we think for every four years
3294336 thank you for the childhood you have taken from us for the unforgettable war scenes you have given us for all the crimes you have committed in the name of serbs for all the lost battles thank you for krajina slavonija bosnia kosovo and everything else you plan to sell under your wise policies thank you for the unforgettable convoys of our brothers for the sound of air raid sirens for all the lives lost in vain happy birthday mr president may you celebrate the next one with your nearest and dearest on a deserved holiday in the hague
3294337 u s federal agencies control puerto ricos foreign relations customs immigration postal system radio tv transportation social security military maritime laws banks commerce currency and defense thats without the people of puerto rico having a vote in u s elections
3294338 milosevic has always wielded repression at home but in a nuanced way but were at the dawn of a naked latin american style dictatorship
3294339 otpor is a new kind of opposition force and its huge popularity in serbia applied a kind of pressure on the opposition to close ranks
3294340 otpor has a remarkable energy and most importantly theyve stood up to milosevic in a way that the established opposition never has
3294341 people on the streets think theyre brave and the opposition is absolutely dependent on them as foot soldiers especially with independent media being silenced
3294342 we dont tell people who to vote for just that their vote counts and that we all have to do our part to get rid of this nightmare called milosevic
3294343 milosevic controls the media and he has 20 percent of the people in his pocket the rest of the country hates his guts and knows he is an evil tyrant its our job to motivate those 80 percent
3294344 milosevic is many things but he is definitely not a funny guy hes stuck in 1386 in a field of black birds with czar lazur losing gloriously to the turks
3294345 were a generation that likes to play jokes to laugh all the time and that is our secret weapon were sick of being defined by a glorious loser we want to join the rest of the world
3294346 thank you for the childhood you have taken from us for the unforgettable war scenes you have given us for all the crimes you have committed in the name of serbs for all the lost battles thank you for the unforgettable convoys of our brothers for the sound of air raid sirens for all the lives lost in vain happy birthday mr president may you celebrate the next one with your nearest and dearest on a deserved holiday in the hague
3294347 i was sure we were doing a good right thing
3294348 they may ignore us now but as we become stronger they will become more nervous and i think we will have a serious crackdown
3294349 otpor has shown no signs of being anything but a homegrown nonviolent movement but that kind of rhetoric laid the ground for legal pretext to crack down on otpors political activities serb authorities essentially made otpor illegal
3294350 milosevic is extremely unpopular within serbia but the trouble is he cant afford to go the hague has indicted him for international crimes so unfortunately at this point anything is possible
3294351 the united states senate worked so hard for so long last year and this legislation was cavalierly dismissed in the final debacle that ended last years session of congress
3294352 the problem was we had set our sights too low
3294353 we were demanding recognition of the voting results when in fact we should have been demonstrating for new municipal legislative and presidential elections under the supervision of international observers like many people i took this failure hard thats why i joined otpor as soon as it was founded two years later
3294354 i showed up at their headquarters on march 20 2000
3294355 i was a little scared i opened the door and said hi my name is sofia and i want to be an activist they handed me a membership form i filled it out and left two weeks later they called me up gave me an appointment and i joined
3294356 i wanted to help change things because i couldnt stand seeing people dealing with so many problems in their day to day lives anymore
3294357 what got me excited was that there werent any leaders so there was no risk of being betrayed
3294358 one day a policeman tore off my badge but he didnt dare arrest me
3294359 what got me excited was that there werent any leaders so there was no risk of being betrayed
3294360 my parents were against milosevic my mother mira wanted to vote for the dos but my father dragan thought of abstaining i talked him into voting
3294361 that day i dragged my father to the parliament building at 2 30 in the afternoon
3294362 i joined otpor in front of the philosophy department at the university
3294363 we stayed there until three oclock before converging on the parliament i was always afraid of the crowd the whole time
3294364 with four boys i was part of an otpor group in touch with the dos our job was to call on belgrades citizens to come out into the streets we were among the first wave of protesters who occupied the b92 radio station which the government had taken over i couldnt sleep several nights in a row i was afraid the government would launch a counter attack
3294365 before then i didnt dare join because i was afraid of retaliation but also because of my parents and grandparents who were hard core milosevic supporters today they feel ashamed
3294366 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
3294367 did not represent as much as embody the palestinian whose political identity in the world had pretty much been reduced to a name on an identity card
3294368 why are we always told that we cannot solve our problem without solving the existential anxiety of the israelis and their supporters who have ignored our very existence for decades in our own homeland
3294369 we should not justify suicide bombers we are against the suicide bombers but we must understand what drives these young people to such actions they want to liberate themselves from such a dark life it is not ideological it is despair
3294370 the accusation is that i hate jews its not comfortable that they show me as a devil and an enemy of israel i am not a lover of israel of course i have no reason to be but i dont hate jews
3294371 i wish that siege was here so that i could
3294372 when i am released i will know that praise of nation
3294373 and where will you take me with those black carnations
3294374 my heart is full of that which is of no concern to you my heart is full of the aroma of sage my heart is innocent radiant brimming there is no time in the heart for tests no i do not love you who are you that i may give my love to you are you part of my being are you a coffee rendezvous are you the wind of the flute and a song that i may love you i hate imprisonment but i do not hate you
3294375 how did you take my place son and jump ahead of me i should have gone first i should have gone first
3294376 i have only changed my place of abode and my furnishings the deer now walk on my bedrooms roof and the moon warms the ceiling from the pain thus putting an end to my pain to put an end to my wailing
3294377 the united states senate worked so hard for so long last year and this legislation was cavalierly dismissed in the final debacle that ended last years session of congress
3294378 the most arrogant bureaucracy ive dealt with during my 16 years in washington
3294379 serious safety problems and airplane noise pose real risks to residents to the regional economy and to the quality of life for district and area residents
3294380 if we could get him to put the energy that hes put into national into a real issue wed all be better off
3294381 you have to wonder what ulterior motive is going on here because he is working awful hard on this
3294382 i hope somebody can figure out why mccain is so angry because it doesnt make sense
3294383 he could take a shit in the middle of the street and people would figure out a way to make it a good thing
3294384 do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father
3294385 i think john mccain is a friend to the entire industry
3294386 if he wont fly nonstop i guarantee that his colleagues and constituents will and every day they will thank god for the mccain express
3294387 this is not gonna help the airline industry except it will help america west
3294388 the bottom line is that america west is the only major carrier in the country that cant serve its hub out of national
3294389 businesspeople want to fly close in to a city and will frankly pay to do so
3294390 if we do not pass this legislation it will be another clear victory for the major airlines and the special interests in washington which will not surprise me nor will it be the first or last time i intend to try to look out for the american consumer
3294391 if he doesnt want to call it pork thats fine to me its pork
3294392 im different than john mccain id be out there doing it for america west thats just the way i approached it but i was known as a pork barrel senator
3294393 its a philosophical thing for mccain the federal government has no business dictating the number of takeoffs and landings at an airport
3294394 you cant criticize anybody for trying to help constituents thats their job
3294395 but lets be honest about it its harming us its helping them lets not couch it on the mantle of these high principles
3294396 we all know the major airlines are dominating the industry more and more every day and the consumer has suffered
3294397 we must give new carriers the opportunity to compete with the major airlines by ensuring that they have access to the nations biggest airports
3294398 access to these important airports can be the difference between profit and loss for a new carrier
3294399 with a statutory bar to more flights noise levels will continue to decline as quieter aircraft are introduced thus all the planned projects at national would simply improve the facility not increase its capacity for air traffic
3294400 everyone has to step back and look at washington as a region were lucky we have three major airports nearby
3294401 the plain fact of the matter is that nobody wants growth at national we want growth at dulles
3294402 dulles is easily the most underutilized airport in the united states for its size
3294403 but dont mislead the public by saying this bill will give you much more competition and lower fares thats lunacy and its frankly pompous legislation
3294404 it wont lower airfares anybody who runs an airline whos in their right mind is going to charge more for a nonstop
3294405 the new entrants are going to have to have a hub outside of the perimeter and other than america west and what were doing there arent that many that qualify
3294406 what tends to happen with start up airlines at slot constrained airports is that small airlines go out of business and big airlines buy up their slots
3294407 if youre not going to let national grow then our position is to take some slots away from the existing airlines
3294408 united airlines has about 19 round trips a day out of national every one of them is to chicago if you lost three or four flights to chicago the world wouldnt come to an end
3294409 the carriers who hold slots now have resisted that strongly the slots mean a good deal to them
3294410 instead of adding and taking away lets make everybody better off
3294411 as you know i am considering running for president of the united states along with several hundred others
3294412 as president of the united states i may not be able to stop pork but i will make two commitments to you one i will veto any pork commitment i can and two i will do my best to make the perpetrators of those projects as famous as possible using every megaphone i can
3294413 i say that when people dont have the facts as substantiated by the gao and the department of transportation saying that this will increase competition then they resort to personal attacks
3294414 its hard for me to understand why mccain should get any more of a bum rap than rep jim moran d va and rep connie morella r md should get because theyre shilling for their people as much as mccains shilling for his people
3294415 weve heard from a number of constituents all of them concerned about the noise that added flights would cause it might make senators flights a little more convenient but for people living in the flight path this is a real quality of life concern
3294416 weve been working hard at trying to get the perimeter rule amended
3294417 despite his sponsorship of campaign finance reforms and homilies against the corrupting influence of special interest contributions mccain is clearly no clod when it comes to his own money chase
3294418 d espite all of his protestations about the evils and inequities of the current campaign finance system arizona sen john mccain r co author of the renowned mccain feingold campaign reform proposal dramatically and unabashedly milks the political money system when his own senate election is on the line
3294419 most of the time we try to make imperceptible moves so the passengers wont notice
3294420 it would just blow your mind what you see in the back is nothing compared to what we see up front
3294421 the controllers do an excellent job they really do when you consider how high density that airport is and to get more in there i dont see it
3294422 mccain is a legend as far as his military time goes and i always thought of him as a nice guy but hes really throwing his weight around now
3294423 he doesnt even understand the history and he doesnt seem to want to try hes upsetting a very finely tuned operation at national airport
3294424 they only have one runway and its either north or south and there are lots of times when the weather is bad and you cant even get in north or south the chances of overrunning or undershooting are much greater there
3294425 the runways and taxiways are not sufficient to hold the traffic that senator mccains talking about
3294426 there will be cancellations i predict not to mention accidents and near misses
3294427 the hidden spirit of the wilderness its mystery its melancholy its charm
3294428 his hearts in the right place hes taking responsibility because thats what he feels the team needs
3294429 i thought i bowled pretty well for my 21 wickets in the series but i was out bowled by ajantha mendis his was truly a special effort because he was bowling against great players of spin the same players that routinely plundered the legendary leg spinner shane warne
3294430 as i said earlier in the series i was not half the bowler mendis is now when i started my career and he proved yet again when he provided the crucial break through as he came around the wicket and had rahul dravid caught at slip once mendis broke that partnership i was confident we would wrap up the innings fairly quickly
3294431 the batsmen did not put up a good show here and that probably cost us the series it was critical that the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency from any of the batters and that probably what cost us the game and the test match here
3294432 having won the toss it was important to get a big score we got a good start but could not capitalise for a new batsman to go straight away and face two spinners it is never easy if they had converted the early starts it would have been a different story overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series

3294446 it was just so cruel and unthinking and so wrong because there is nothing you can do to prevent yourself being raped it is not illegal to go out and have a drink it is illegal to rape somebody
3294447 its appalling the number of women that are probably getting this letter and arent fighting because they dont know that they can
3294448 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption

3294452 georgia will be a reliable partner for nato london supports your countrys accession to the north atlantic alliance i believe that georgia has worked hard over the past few years and deserves our support i know the opinion of other european leaders on this issue i call on the leaders of other countries to support georgias quick accession to nato georgia has worked quite actively to promote the interests of the west this is confirmed by the presence of georgian troops in iraq we will continue to work actively with your countrys government on issues concerning georgias membership of nato in the future

3294462 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3294463 although i cannot comment on the individual decisions of the criminal injuries compensation authority i can be clear that it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3294464 this stance supports our view that a victim of rape is not in any way culpable due to alcohol consumption it is never an individuals fault if he she gets raped regardless of how much he she has drunk

3294527 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3294528 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings

3294533 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3294534 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3294535 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3294536 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love

3294543 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3294544 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3294545 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3294546 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent

3294566 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3294567 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3294568 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3294569 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important

3294583 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3294584 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3294585 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3294586 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3294587 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3294588 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3294589 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3294590 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3294591 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3294592 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3294593 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3294594 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3294595 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3294596 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3294597 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3294598 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3294599 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3294600 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3294601 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3294602 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3294603 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3294604 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3294605 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3294606 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3294607 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3294608 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3294609 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living

3294612 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years

3294614 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3294615 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3294616 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3294617 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3294618 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3294619 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3294620 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3294621 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3294622 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3294623 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3294624 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3294625 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3294626 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3294627 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3294628 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3294629 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3294630 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3294631 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3294632 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3294633 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3294634 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3294635 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3294636 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3294637 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3294638 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3294639 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3294640 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3294641 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3294642 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3294643 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3294644 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3294645 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3294646 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3294647 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3294648 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3294649 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3294650 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3294651 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3294652 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3294653 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3294654 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3294655 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3294656 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3294657 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3294658 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3294659 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3294660 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3294661 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3294662 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3294663 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3294664 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3294665 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3294666 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3294667 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3294668 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3294669 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3294670 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3294671 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3294672 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3294673 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3294674 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3294675 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3294676 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3294677 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3294678 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3294679 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3294680 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3294681 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3294682 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3294683 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3294684 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3294685 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3294686 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3294687 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3294688 just so you all know we did set a record
3294689 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3294690 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3294691 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3294692 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3294693 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3294694 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3294695 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3294696 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3294697 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3294698 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3294699 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3294700 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3294701 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3294702 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3294703 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3294704 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3294705 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3294706 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3294707 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3294708 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3294709 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3294710 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3294711 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3294712 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3294713 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3294714 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3294715 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3294716 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3294717 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3294718 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3294719 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3294720 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3294721 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3294722 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3294723 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3294724 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3294725 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3294726 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3294727 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3294728 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3294729 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3294730 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3294731 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3294732 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3294733 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3294734 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3294735 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3294736 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3294737 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3294738 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3294739 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3294740 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3294741 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3294742 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3294743 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3294744 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3294745 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3294746 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3294747 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3294748 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3294749 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3294750 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3294751 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3294752 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3294753 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3294754 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3294755 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3294756 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3294757 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3294758 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3294759 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3294760 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3294761 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3294762 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3294763 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3294764 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3294765 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3294766 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3294767 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3294768 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3294769 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3294770 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3294771 strategy as he eyes his own run for reelection in 2010
3294772 working very hard to maintain his independence given his position as leader
3294773 to introduce himself to thousands of new nevadans that move into the state every month
3294774 he has to balance his image out to make sure hes not too far out of touch
3294775 hes mastered that strategy harry reid is very concerned with the survival of harry reid
3294776 immediately liked reid when he took over because he was partisan
3294777 i dont want it to seem like its a big lovefest for harry reid in the netroots but we respect him
3294778 harry reid is on a lot of issues a good ally thats the highest praise we can give
3294779 you really have seen this evolution of skepticism about reid who is not a liberal democrat to now where you see him take on the classic national liberal democratic leadership profile
3294780 when he comes back to nevada hes still harry reid from searchlight nev but hes now one of them the democratic elite
3294781 der fahrzeugf hrer war zuvor mit berh hter geschwindigkeit von der landesgrenze kommend und in richtung nordel fahrend aufgefallen
3294782 aufgrund der menge der aufgefundenen drogen bestand der verdacht des handeltreibens
3294783 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3294784 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3294785 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3294786 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3294787 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3294788 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3294789 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3294790 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3294791 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3294792 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3294793 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3294794 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3294795 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3294796 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3294797 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3294798 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3294799 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3294800 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3294801 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3294802 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3294803 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3294804 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3294805 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3294806 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3294807 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3294808 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3294809 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3294810 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3294811 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3294812 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3294813 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3294814 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3294815 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3294816 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3294817 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3294818 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3294819 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3294820 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3294821 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3294822 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3294823 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3294824 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3294825 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3294826 braid is the highest rated xbox live arcade game of all time out of about 150 games geometry wars 2 released a week prior is the second highest there are some strong games coming up in the next few weeks so well see if these positions hold
3294827 i just wanted to do some riding during the break have some fun and i thought that maybe itd give me a little spark for the rest of the season but it backfired on me
3294828 drug use should be treated in the same way as alcohol and nicoteine sic which are both deadly drugs sold on shopping shelves and taxed to the hilt by every government
3294829 the worldwide web is an interesting beast and it provides great opportunity for information dissemination but also information distortion
3294830 that is policy nonsense to suggest wed be going there
3294831 tanto la soluci n de privatizar parte del capital de aena como la de involucrar en la gesti n a todas las administraciones pues en otras experiencias internacionales esto ha dado malos resultados
3294832 cuando se ha compartido la gesti n entre el sector p blico y el privado en otros pa ses el fracaso ha sido tremendo
3294833 habr a comit s de control o supervisi n en los que participar an aena y las administraciones territoriales involucradas que no gestionar an sino que
3294834 la propiedad es lo de menos en estos casos porque lo que importa privatizar es la gesti n
3294835 la tendencia generalizada al incremento de la flexibilidad y autonom a de gesti n de los aeropuertos en un entorno de competencia creciente as como a la entrada del sector privado en el mercado aeroportuario
3294836 la privatizaci n de aena es uno de las viejas aspiraciones de solbes y seguramente forma parte del pacto que alcanz con el presidente para seguir de ministro de econom a a pesar de la presencia de sebasti n en el gabinete

3295018 since emerging from the collapsing soviet union as an independent state in 1991 georgia has again become the arena of conflicting interests this time between a the us and a revived russia it has also faced a tough challenge from two separatist regions abkhazia and south ossetia
3295019 over 1 300 people are reported after russian forces responded to a georgian attack on rebels in the breakaway province of south ossetia by mounting a full scale invasion
3295020 just over 7 days ago us forces just left the air base that is reporting to have been attacked by russian federation air force assets
3295021 we have been following events in breakaway abkhazia and south ossetia russian backed breakaway south ossetian capital tskhinvali shelled from georgia which covered the shelling of tskhinval resulting in several deaths
3295022 this is a long and convoluted struggle now inflamed because partly russia will not recognise the us manufactured statelet gangster hinterland and site of huge us base called kosovo carved out of serbia see kla is cia lab bondsteel camp byzantine blog
3295023 so the russkis are helping the abkhazians a major smuggling route and south ossetians total pop 70 000 with their special gazprom gas supply so if the georgian gas is cut off they remain warm in winter at least
3295024 it is also related to the btc pipeline baku tblisi ceyhan and us moves to get georgia and the ukraine within the nato family threatening russias southern flank
3295025 in my opinion these developments are due in part to advice georgia received from israeli companies that operate there

3295206 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history and the olympics have been around for so many years is a pretty amazing accomplishment

3295209 exeter wanted bbc and i got bde so my headmaster contacted them and pleaded with them to give me a place
3295210 it would have been stupid to wait while they thought about it because places go quickly through clearing so i got onto hull and was put through to someone in the department who asked me some questions and said i could have a place
3295211 within a day exeter got back and said they would still accept me but i decided to stick with hull mainly because id looked on the website and the course sounded really good as i hadnt previously thought about going up north i hadnt bothered researching northern universities but my dad knew something about hull and told me it was an interesting place
3295212 i couldnt stop crying but dad took over and made a list of all the places to phone he was brilliant
3295213 i was asked for two decent a level passes including a c in music technology but i got a d in that a b in drama and an e in physics
3295214 i was devastated but i decided to get on the phone and do what i could to get the place when i spoke to the admissions office i explained that although id missed a c i had a good portfolio and id be happy to show it to them in the end i didnt need to they offered me a place
3295215 its essential you get on the phone straightaway because you never know how many other people are in the same position you only need 10 or 20 others to miss their grades or a few to have done better than expected and gone elsewhere and there could be a place available for you
3295216 i got a letter from ucas which said these are the options but iwasnt happy because i was looking at things like law and spanish or law and history which would be even more challenging than straight law
3295217 because clearing was so simple to use i did everything myself and got on with it straightaway i phoned kent and spoke to a man about criminal justice studies who made it sound really interesting
3295218 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3295219 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3295220 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3295221 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile

3295223 we chose not to know if we were having a boy or a girl until she was born shes the first girl born on either side of the family since rebecca

3295226 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3295227 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses

3295229 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3295230 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3295231 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3295232 if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3295233 that is definitely in the back of our minds its the ultimate goal getting softball put back into the lineup for 2016

3295236 any olympics in general we are going to try to come out and put down our best performance
3295237 but there probably is a desire to really put a stamp on this one we know that its the last olympics for softball at least for now
3295238 this is definitely my last olympics and wed like to give everyone something to really remember
3295239 ive said all along that our job as players and coaches right now is to prepare ourselves and do as well as we can as a team
3295240 were not trying to put on a show were playing the game the way we know how to play the game usa softball is playing the game hard playing aggressively playing with heart if it was a great show i hope we have eight more great shows

3295308 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3295309 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3295321 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3295322 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3295323 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3295324 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3295325 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3295326 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3295327 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3295328 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3295329 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3295330 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3295331 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3295332 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3295333 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3295334 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3295335 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3295336 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3295337 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3295338 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3295339 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3295340 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3295341 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3295342 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3295343 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3295344 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3295345 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3295346 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3295347 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3295348 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3295349 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3295350 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3295351 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3295352 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

3295360 it has nothing to with real life nothing to do with justice its politics and politicians
3295361 this is more of a kick at the mayor by the governor
3295362 yes i know chicago is chicago and its a big city and mayor daley is the mayor there but im the governor of all of illinois
3295363 when communities are being dominated by gangbangers i think we have a responsibility to be as helpful as we can
3295364 youd have to strip some section of the state bare to provide enough state police to make any sort of impact
3295365 and its not like there are 200 300 sitting around a barracks somewhere waiting to get a call
3295366 if the idea was there is a need for more police theyd hire more chicago police officers
3295367 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3295368 please im asking you i cant live like this please give me a little bit of respect im just trying to f king fill up my car
3295369 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again
3295370 days before the show i knew russia would win the fact is putin was getting nasty which means the former satellite states were always going to vote for russia in order to keep the oil coming
3295371 its unfortunate i suppose but whereas we have always taken eurovision with a pinch of salt the former eastern bloc countries are not sufficiently versed in the ways of democracy to realise they are supposed to be voting for a song not a next door neighbour
3295372 under his leadership in the 70s the bbc commissioned and produced a raft of entertainment and comedy which set a benchmark for these genres which has rarely been surpassed
3295373 from monty python to morecambe and wise from the generation game to dads army these shows and others like them have helped to define not just a genre but a generation
3295374 bill cotton was always there to remind us that the bbc mission to entertain could be just as ambitious and aspirational as our commitment to inform and educate
3295375 responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3295376 if anyone is going to harm the fish and sleep through the alarm theyre going to get a jug of fish water over them
3295377 i tell people that i like her and i act and show it in my actions she on the other hand doesnt
3295378 you can say that im your type of guy but if you dont act like it then it means nothing
3295379 seems to be incremental to the broadcast television that people have always watched
3295380 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3295381 online tv services are primarily used as a means of catching up with the broadcast stream
3295382 after every show on my tour i stay behind to do an autograph signing but about a dozen women will want a snog i just sweetly say no thank you if i kissed everybody who asked id probably go away with something i dont really want
3295383 i was reading a magazine and opened it up to a picture of either scarlett johansson or megan fox and i turned to my boyfriend and said you know if they walked through the door and asked me to pucker up i would just do it
3295384 now that we can measure it we find that russias gdp is approximately equal to that of brazil which is not to knock brazil much of russias wealth comes from resource extraction in other words russia is not making stuff is it thinking stuff instead well is there a nascent biotech or semiconductor industry in russia today or is there maybe some other more esoteric kind of activity that hasnt yet permeated popular consciousness how are russian universities doing
3295385 the equipment its using in front line units is still a generation behind western to say nothing of american capabilities
3295386 the award is fantastic and we feel really proud because we have worked towards being a community pub it is very much a pub where anybody can come in for a drink
3295387 we have groups of women who come in and feel safe and various other groups such as those from church the scouts and local artists who use the place for meetings
3295388 weve got a narrow boat and canal room because we are so close to the canal

3295392 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3295393 i can report on russian supremacy in the airspace georgian aircraft stopped flying
3295394 then they will do worse here than what they did in chechnya

3295396 it looks possible that inflation will hit 5 within two or three months as the latest round of utility price hikes affects the index

3295400 the aggressor must know that the attack against a sovereign country will bring international sanctions
3295401 such an aggression against a sovereign country is impermissible and demands immediate and resolute international interference
3295402 if earlier georgias sovereignyy and territorial integrity was expressed at least in words then one month before admitting flights of threat over georgias territory russia dropped its pretences and started to prepare for an outright aggression

3295670 hes the one with millions of dollars to spend on promoting this technology and researching it and he needs to take responsibility for his actions because he is now exposing many other rural industries like the bee keepers and the grain harvesters to contamination

3295719 its too much of a drastic change to go from egypt to china especially when the first two films were based in egyptologys legends
3295720 so if you are not going to see this movie why the hell are you all soooooooo worried about everything related to it
3295721 a troll is an individual who enjoys creating conflict on the internet

3295742 you might not be cured but youre no longer worried about being addicted
3295743 he knows you from the internet site then i turned around and rob was there again and he said to me
3295744 but instead of seeing the courage i had in doing that movie against everybody who tried to stop me you are sitting on your desks and you are working on stories about me and my image as the worst director on earth and you fullfill what your editor wants from you in regards of uwe boll or you fullfill what you think makes you a cooler guy in the internet and you are not getting it that you are only interested in movies like iron man or hulk or kung fu panda or the mummy 3 because the studios spending 60 mio in advertising to make you interested in non interesting movies how many times you wanna keep going in movies only because the trailer was so cool and the cgi was so great
3295745 what is a place like me doing in a girl like this

3295751 why the hell are you still so worried about this movie if your main interest did the right thing going away ok that s all

3295753 eerrrr my young men know about my sort of crush on the leading actor lol lol hey mummettes sorry i m repeating this little story i already told you on facebook
3295754 of the making process of a huge movie and maybe even more important he made that a few persons leaving in very distant places of the world became friends
3295755 hey thats pretty cool perhaps ill enjoy it more than i did the second one
3295756 the world is dense competitive and usually aligned against you
3295757 eerrrr my young men know about my sort of crush on the leading actor lol lol hey mummettes sorry i m repeating this little story i already told you on facebook
3295758 of the making process of a huge movie and maybe even more important he made that a few persons leaving in very distant places of the world became friends

3295761 you must not to have fun when you go to the theater
3295762 nobody can tell me what kind of music which actor which director which painter i must love and when i read all those critics that are dissecting tearing apart a movie analyzing it part by part i always wonder how the hell can they enjoy anything if instead of take a look at the
3295763 i m glad that this movie is so bad cuz i knew and i wanted that it would be so bad
3295764 i am invited to sit in on what is known as a round table interview seven or eight international journalists competing with one another to see who can ask the most banal questions
3295765 and these are the words that i really wanna borrow from brendan
3295766 i m entitled to have my own opinion you are not cuz i m right but you are wrong this is my opinion and it is mine and i can say it cuz it is my opinion blah blah blah
3295767 you should do the things like i think they should be done
3295768 heck we had the privilege of being witnesses of the birth of this huge movie wooow
3295769 of course no matter where you are egypt china where ever
3295770 why didn t rob cast freddie boath a teenager would be better to play alex part
3295771 why the hell did rob put that dangerous armament in the hands of a child that s cks he must be sued for that
3295772 whoever said their performance was bad is ignorant and dumb
3295773 the big problem with most science fiction films is they spend so much time on the sets that they get screen time
3295774 hilarious i guess that our captain would have had the same expression that our ricochet had lol lol

3295781 you guys could all earn degrees in professional dick riding
3295782 but hey dont take what ive said in the negative rude wrong way
3295783 to get back to talking about rob cohen and the mummy 3 movie which is the reason he even created this blog in the first place
3295784 lets stay on subject and leave our personal lives out of this blog
3295785 for hosting this game in beijing thousands of more chinese people have been put in jail and some even lost their lives
3295786 for hosting olympics in beijing thousands of more chinese people have been put in jail and some even lost their lives
3295787 i perfectly know what stephen sommers is thinking about this movie and is not what he is saying on the bts clip
3295788 in a very real way you have been with me every step of the way
3295789 i would tell you to fasten your seat belts but i was too cheap to buy any huhhaha
3295790 the sea is everything its part of a supernatural movement for it in land men can fight each other and unleash all horrors and misery but here their power is nothing here i find peace here i am free

3295795 dont tell me that the white boy is gonna have the asian girl
3295796 i have to wait for my thesis to cool down
3295797 the movie feels like the direct to dvd version of the mummy complete with cheesy already done cg effects and best of all not a single actual mummy in the entire movie
3295798 and you think tm3 will lack of quality well defined story etc etc right so you don t wanna see it right so why are you interested in come to this place and make the racket that surely you knew you would make
3295799 cannot believe that eve was not written out of this film

3295801 rob just know that me and the original mummettes have will never stop supporting you this movie is gonna be great and im not gonna let a horde of trolls ruin my opinion of tm3
3295802 this is just another cheap popcorn movie bad ggi same old script blah blah blah
3295803 were you to watch this film with the volume off it might be a fairly good adventure film
3295804 every film is a journey in which you learn new things about life at every level

3295808 no no why do you like harrison ford brendan fraser is better
3295809 not slating mr spielberg as a capable director but i guess that whoever is really a mythical director

3295821 ever since i converted to buddhism and made dragon the bruce lee story ive wanted to make a movie about china
3295822 when i made the decision to make the son 21
3295823 i got a very angry phone call from weiszs agent saying shell never play the mother of a 21 year old i said okay good fine bye it was critical to me to have this old bull young bull family element the father cant yet recognize the sons manhood so it was important for the kid to not be a baby

3295829 you know brendan can act when he wants to but youre right for the most part he picks silly rolls because he thinks theyll be fun
3295830 i couldnt have known until it actually happened the amount of detail and subtlety and sensitivity of his acting in front of the camera
3295831 i see the film gods and monsters and think will i ever be able to act like that it isnt a question of his acting being better than mine its just a bit more appropriate than mine perhaps more effortless than mine so i am a huge admirer of his that he can be so subtle and yet so broad
3295832 to live on the screen through my thoughts sometimes spoken but often not
3295833 the primitive crew we all are definitely into mummydragon mania

3295856 it must be killing rob cohen for him to have to kiss up to the small band of loony commentators who basically live on his blog you get a sense in his writing that he know that he has a cinematic turkey on his hands and he would rather not even do the film if he had a choice any director who had some faith in the work he is doing would not lay it on as thick as rob has been doing for this film and you almost feel bad for him
3295857 rob ga er maar helemaal voor en laat ze maar kletsen

3295903 johnny danke f r alles ohne dich w re ich nichts wir werden ganz gro rauskommen
3295904 nyi pu was taken from his home early tuesday morning
3295905 police said they want to question him but it is not clear what they want to know
3295906 the report highlights the differences between prices paid by australian consumers and consumers in other countries when roaming overseas to a range of popular business and tourist destinations
3295907 the mobile telecommunications industry is understandably very concerned that a very limited analysis of this kind must be read with a full understanding and clear disclosure of the constraints of its information sources and the conclusions heavily qualified to avoid a totally misleading impression of the actual situation
3295908 unfortunately jet lag is not the only thing that knocks over australians when they return from abroad they can also be floored by their mobile phone bills
3295909 the ausvet plan is very clear on what is required to prevent any further spread of this highly fatal disease
3295910 in these cases human health and safety must come first
3295911 in the interests of protecting people and horses from further infection euthanasia is the most appropriate response
3295912 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3295913 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3295914 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3295915 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3295916 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3295917 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3295918 if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3295919 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3295920 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 in july was well above expectations furthermore the rise cannot be attributed solely to sharply higher food and energy prices
3295921 even with the recent drop in oil prices it still looks possible that inflation will hit 5 within two or three months as the latest round of utility price hikes affects the index
3295922 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that china stop the repression
3295923 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3295924 one is the sophisticated co ordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organisation to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3295925 this is a way in which we can convey our sympathy to michaels parents family and friends
3295926 liverpool is a community that is proud of its diversity and we will not tolerate hatred or violence
3295927 i share the feeling of the overwhelming majority of citizens of the city who stand united in our condemnation of homophobia and violence
3295928 residents here like people all over the country say a more visible police presence would give them peace of mind
3295929 however police resources are limited and though they wanted to help they simply did not have the funds for another vehicle to patrol this area which is outside of the main towns in tameside
3295930 we approached our friends at the district assembly and they were only too happy to support us
3295931 it is a priority of this council to work closely with the police and partners such as peak valley housing to help reduce crime and the fear of crime
3295932 the provision of this car will assist police officers with responding faster to calls for assistance from the public as well as with reducing crime hattersley is already a great place to live and work and this should make it even better
3295933 our thanks go to both funders for providing this essential tool which will give us higher visibility in the local area and of course help us serve the area much more efficiently

3295936 in order to redress the issue of patient involvement the rsm has decided to introduce a medicine and me conference on the subject of cfs me
3295937 this will be part of a series of conferences aimed at a wider audience the planning of which will include patients and the format of which allows patients to speak first and experts to respond to the issues raised typically the audiences for these conferences will be comprised of 70 patients and families this particular series has proved extremely successful in allowing patients to share their experiences focus on issues of greatest important to them and allow true dialogue between patients and acknowledged experts this conference will be held in the early part of the 2008 09 academic year
3295938 is keen to make the event as attractive as possible to patients and avoid the criticisms levelled at this years event when people with me demonstrated against its psychiatric bias and the failure to include them in its programme

3295940 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3295941 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3295942 the operation is being carried out solely by forces of the abkhaz army
3295943 in the course of the next few days we will take full control of this district
3295944 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3295945 the georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3295946 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3295947 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3295948 the flawed internal and external policies of his dictatorial regime have resulted in the large scale murder of innocent people of our province and fata federally administered tribal areas

3295952 has not intentionally engaged in any conduct or practice that would ruin the integrity of the impartial environment it has worked to foster
3295953 during the election process st rose worked collaboratively with seiu cna and the national labor relations board to foster a fair and impartial environment in which the nurses involved could freely make an informed decision
3295954 technical argument that obscures the fact that the seiu did have far greater access during the election
3295955 rather than get hung up on all these technicalities lets go forward with a new election
3295956 the seiu is trying to stall the election because they know they would lose the election
3295957 if we keep saying recession then well have a recession
3295958 right now we have the cash flow necessary to avoid a special session
3295959 we may have another special session if the numbers dont prove to be healthy
3295960 the problem is not taxes the problem is spending we have a spending problem
3295961 were not at a point where a special session is necessary
3295962 i had visions of my entire case showing up on the internet
3295963 would be like harry reid taking money from rush limbaugh
3295964 we have made it very clear for months now but it was not just us every democratic group knows about adelsons involvement with freedoms watch
3295965 i dont have any view on that and i dont think mr adelson does either
3295966 i think most democrats have decided not to accept this money
3295967 it probably goes back to when there was a transsexual in the show in the mid to late 80s the hotel found out later that she really had been a man
3295968 when you can silence an audience of these geeks youve created magic
3295969 who would think that science fiction fans would be so interested in a classical type of product
3295970 but you realize that its the fabric that moves the story forward the fight scenes in the tv show thats all music
3295971 its like water skiing behind a 747 in the nude its a very visceral thing
3295972 hell probably be asleep by the time we hit the freeway
3295973 energy efficiency is the cheapest fastest way of meeting our energy demand
3295974 so for up to a 4 degree difference we wouldnt have to pay for a 5 billion coal plant
3295975 sometimes it gets a little warmer but you just push the button if it gets too hot
3295976 weve been trying to target single family homes in areas where we have distribution systems that are approaching design limits
3295977 reducing power consumption in certain areas at peak will avoid spending millions ripping up the street to put in more lines
3295978 if all the 20 million went into paid media and outreach efforts and not enough into community support networks it would miss a key opportunity
3295979 you could spend 50 million or 100 million but until you get to the ground level like in a supermarket youre not going to get hispanics to vote
3295980 its not high school spanish in ad campaigns that does it we need to feel like were significant we need face to face we all want to see the body

3296085 what we are telling them is get the tamils on your side by greater devolution of power for them to be part of sri lankan state they need the huge tamil minority on their side
3296086 obviously the tamil tigers have been weakened they have met with heavier casualties than previously

3296157 libby is in trouble not for what he did but because he wasnt as careful as the others during his interviews and grand jury testimony if hed just said i dont recall a hundred times or even invoked the fifth whether properly or not following the monica goodling approach he wouldnt be bankrupt ruined disgraced and heading to prison
3296158 the whole phenomenon of special prosecutors turns the usual rules of investigating on their head instead of focusing on crimes special prosecutors tend to focus on people themselves dig deep enough ask enough questions particularly under oath and only those most experienced with the criminal justice system are likely to escape unscathed hardened criminals know enough to shut up for others the human tendency is to say too much to shade the facts to try to protect yourself and your colleagues not necessarily from criminality but from embarrassment lewis libby is a lawyer but he hadnt practiced in years and neither had his wife unfortunately for him it cost him plenty

3296161 if were going to try and compete even at premier league level let alone europe we need a decent squad so we need to keep adding quality if we can
3296162 weve lost freddie bouma and we were quite thin on the ground before that that sort of injury can happen at any given minute therefore we need to try and safeguard as much as we can
3296163 what weve done is bring in a recognised right back and a recognised left back to help us we didnt have the right back last year but it wasnt for lack of trying
3296164 weve not finished well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3296165 last season we were exceptionally lucky with injuries eight or nine players played over 30 games and we didnt have big runs in the fa or league cup therefore we were able to concentrate on the league

3296171 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years

3296178 sadly trophy jaws and teeth from sharks are relatively commonplace whereas living sharks are becoming increasingly rare
3296179 this method allows information locked away within the teeth and jaws to be exploited to assist with conservation management
3296180 sharks have continual turnover of dentition throughout their lifespan and consequently teeth may be collected from the seafloor in areas where sharks aggregate without the need to use invasive sampling methods such as biopsy
3296181 these data support our hunch that low genetic variation in grey nurse shark is probably due to longer term processes than the recent human induced population crash

3296185 sudan has recorded significant progress in protecting childrens health since the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement

3296198 yet had james ii not made myriad errors after succeeding his brother king charles ii in 1683 errors that help to trigger williams later intervention french style absolutism might really have sprung into life in england mr barone writes perhaps in late 1688 or early 1689 such absolutism was doing well on the continent especially under louis xiv and james was busy trying to buy the coming general election and pack the house of commons when an heir was born to james in june 1688 establishing the catholic succession the moment of decision had arrived
3296199 everything that flowed from the whig victory of 1688 limited government the bank of england tradable national debt triennial parliaments mercantilism free enterprise an aggressively anti french foreign policy the union with scotland eventually the hanoverian succession and the industrial revolution combined to make the english speaking peoples powerful mr barone proves beyond doubt how much the glorious revolution inspired the founding fathers to launch their own with virginia gentlemen farmers seeing themselves as the heirs of englands revolutionary aristocrats the 1689 bill of rights in britain thus unquestionably paved the way to the american bill of rights of 1791
3296200 t races its worldwide use and development in the process exposing the role of state intelligence agencies particularly those of the united states israel india and pakistan in globalizing urban terrorist techniques mike davis argues that it is the incessant impact of car bombs rather than the more apocalyptic threats of nuclear or bio terrorism that is changing cities and urban lifestyles as privileged centers of power increasingly surround themselves with rings of steel against a weapon that nevertheless seems impossible to defeat
3296201 people working for social change face plenty of difficult questions but sometimes matters of strategy and tactics receive low priority among many north american activists the role of nonviolence as the default mode of struggle bears little scrutiny is nonviolence effective at ending systems of oppression how is nonviolence connected to white privilege is militancy naturally macho or does pacifism reinforce the same power dynamics as patriarchy ultimately does nonviolence protect the state how nonviolence protects the state brings existing criticisms of nonviolence and several new ones together into one book in an attempt to illuminate one of the most severe roadblocks to social change today
3296202 in this new and unabridged translation of the definitive biography of spanish revolutionary and military strategist buenaventura durruti abel paz has given us much more than an account of a single mans life durruti in the spanish revolution is as much the chronicle of an entire nation and of a tumultuous historical era paz seamlessly weaves intimate biographical details of durrutis life his progression from factory worker and father to bank robber political exile and eventually revolutionary leader with extensive historical background behind the scenes governmental intrigue and blow by blow accounts of major battles and urban guerrilla warfare written with a thorough and sympathetic understanding of the anarchist ideals that motivated durruti this is an amazing and exhaustive study of an incredible man and his life long fight against totalitarianism in both its capitalist and stalinist forms includes an afterword by jos luis gutierr z molinas on abel pazs life and the historiography of the spanish revolution

3296211 if they want to protest and they want to hold a demonstration and they want to stand there with a poster or placard or banner theyre entitled to do that what they are not entitled to do what nobody is entitled to do is build permanent structures on city streets without the citys permission

3296238 the russians say that your troops have killed some 2 000 people in ossetia do you have any estimate about how many people have been killed and injured
3296239 and we only responded when after many hours of artillery barrage after a unilateral ceasefire declared by us that killed lots of people by the way because we wouldnt respond on our side
3296240 then when i heard around 11 30 11 50 p m that 150 russian tanks are entering our sovereign territory from this place there is a very mountain you know long mountainous tunnel called the rocky tunnel into the georgian territory our forces were stationed somewhere here so when they got entered the only way we could get them was to respond with artillery fire to stop mass land invasion of the sort that happened to afghanistan and czechoslovakia in 1968
3296241 georgian president mikheil saakashvili seems to care less about these people than about asserting that they live in georgian territory
3296242 saakashvili is a famously volatile risk taker veering between war monger and peacemaker democrat and autocrat on several occasions international officials have pulled him back from the brink on a visit to washington in 2004 he received a tongue lashing from then secretary of state colin powell who told him to act with restraint two months ago he could have triggered a war with his other breakaway province of abkhazia by calling for the expulsion of russian peacekeepers from there but european diplomats persuaded him to step back this time he has yielded to provocation and stepped over the precipice

3296281 its a very different place than say queeny park or forest park
3296282 like those it is a refuge but what makes it different is theres so much more open space around it take away that open space and you just ruin the park experience
3296283 they may call it a 500 year levee but i think we were all recently reminded of what flooding rivers tend to do to earthen levees
3296284 i would expect that what we would build would accentuate the park
3296285 we want to make it friendly for people to come from the park for a cup of coffee and vice versa for people who live and work at the development to go to the park
3296286 not only would that spoil the serenity of the park but it would hurt other businesses in the city particularly west port plaza
3296287 the city should be treating creve coeur park as its jewel and putting their redevelopment efforts toward established businesses before they turn into urban blight
3296288 theres already a degree of obsolescence in the west port area but that doesnt make it unviable and we dont want to lose it
3296289 were looking at redoing the west port plan with an eye away from the office warehouse stuff and more toward flex space for a site that would be attractive to lots of startup businesses

3296502 ende 2007 entwickelten wir gemeinsam mit gebert software in mehreren arbeitskreissitzungen das grunds tzliche konzept f r pitop
3296503 denn damit wir softwarelieferungen des herstellers verwalten und eigene nderungen m glichst automatisiert pflegen k nnen ben tigten wir ein werkzeug das uns bei den migrationsprozessen aufwandsschonend und sicher unterst tzt
3296504 stellt der hersteller eine neue version bereit in der zwangsl ufig unsere individuellen anpassungen in der vorg ngerversion nicht ber cksichtigt sind sollen sie automatisch in die neue source eingespielt werden und mit m glichst geringem programmieraufwand wieder dem produktionsbetrieb zur verf gung stehen
3296505 werden copy und headerdateien vom hersteller der bankensoftware neu geliefert oder ge ndert so m ssen die entsprechenden cobol und c programme neu bersetzt werden unsere erwartung war deshalb dass das tool diese abh ngigen elemente selbstst ndig erkennt
3296506 da sich prozesse oder verfahren ndern k nnen muss das verwaltungssystem flexibel anpassenbar sein da ein l ngerer stillstand bei der softwarepflege schnell gro e wirtschaftliche folgen haben k nnte
3296507 ohne pitop w re eine effektive bearbeitung und verwaltung gar nicht machbar gewesen
3296508 die applikationen k nnen schnell auf unsere erfordernisse zugeschnitten und getestet werden
3296509 im fehlerfall ist eine r ckspielung des vorherigen softwarestandes sehr schnell m glich so dass es nicht zu l ngeren produktionsausf llen kommt

3296524 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3296525 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3296526 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3296527 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3296528 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3296529 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3296530 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3296531 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3296535 at seven i pee like a horse at eight i crap like a cow
3296536 this is a big milestone and we have passed it six months early
3296537 the cpi inflation number by itself is marginally positive but its not completely safe in terms of chinas inflation because the producer price index is definitely picking up
3296538 it may have some effect on consumer prices several months later

3296540 we believe this results marks the tipping point for hkex in terms of earnings progression the strong trading conditions that prevailed in the second half of 2007 were always going to provide a tough prior year comparative for hkex however this is expected to be compounded by the recent fading of trading activity
3296541 apparently they were unable to keep mikheil saakashvilli from his temptation to solve all his problems

3296543 i cannot see us accepting this french draft of the resolution
3296544 no reference to georgian aggression no reference to the atrocities we have seen
3296545 we are in the process of the invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3296546 we dont want regime change in tbilisi our goal is the peaceful settlement of the conflict
3296547 however the fate of saakashvili is in the hands of his own people
3296548 we no longer know the limits of the invading russian army
3296549 the russian army is trying to enforce peace and to do that we have to attack the georgian military
3296550 it looks possible that inflation will hit 5 within two or three months as the latest round of utility price hikes affects the index
3296551 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3296552 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3296553 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3296554 it looks possible that inflation will hit 5 within two or three months as the latest round of utility price hikes affects the index

3296575 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3296576 needless to say given the political nature a lot of people are pretty interested in what were going to be saying
3296577 theres no question in ottawa that so many of the environmental concerns do relate to the western provinces and i have strong background in that area

3296579 the victim died as a result of injuries received from the use of a firearm
3296580 approximately one month ago there was a call of a domestic disturbance at the same residence which had resulted in charges laid against dunseath in respect to firearms possession
3296581 the residence has been searched under search warrant and some firearms have been seized
3296582 we cant recall without going into old historical records any murders in strathmore before this incident
3296583 what happened in this case was both deplorable and tragic
3296584 one can only imagine the terror that was experienced by the victims dan olineck and melanie tanner when violently attacked by two masked intruders

3296642 the females dont bother they just stay around and they know the males will get there

3296644 but if it had been rats i would eagerly have done rats
3296645 but i always say hedgehogs and badgers have always been around together so why do we suddenly see this big decline

3296729 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3296730 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3296731 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3296732 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3296733 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3296734 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3296735 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3296736 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3296737 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3296738 oh dylan kon ik je maar brood en melk brengen
3296739 o god ik wou dat ik nooit met hem getrouwd was
3296740 ik ben nog jong en wil strijden met de besten in eerste klasse dus
3296741 bree is altijd goed geweest voor mij maar de financi le problemen zijn niet opgelost en bovendien speelt het in tweede klasse
3296742 het is niet omdat ik vertrek dat ik niet meer in bree geloof maar ik neem geen risicos
3296743 ik bedank antwerp voor het vertrouwen ik sta voor een mooie uitdaging bij mijn nieuwe club yves dupont is de enige speler die ik ken bij de giants hopelijk likt het opnieuw tussen ons bij bree maakten we elkaar sterker
3296744 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3296745 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3296746 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3296747 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3296748 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3296749 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3296750 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3296751 i like my coffee like i like my men black
3296752 i like my men like i like my chocolate dark rich and sweet
3296753 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3296754 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3296755 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3296756 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3296757 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3296758 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3296759 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3296760 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3296761 stop slow down enjoy your food and you will realize you only need the tiniest amount to be happy
3296762 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3296763 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3296764 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3296765 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3296766 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3296767 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3296768 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3296769 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3296770 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3296771 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3296772 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3296773 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3296774 who are open to doing something on the production side
3296775 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3296776 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3296777 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3296778 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3296779 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3296780 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3296781 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3296782 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3296783 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3296784 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3296785 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3296786 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3296787 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3296788 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3296789 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3296790 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3296791 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3296792 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3296793 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3296794 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3296795 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3296796 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3296797 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3296798 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3296799 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3296800 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3296801 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3296802 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3296803 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3296804 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3296805 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3296806 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3296807 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3296813 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3296814 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3296815 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3296816 can i talk to you about something some of this might be hurtful or make you mad or both which is why i havnt said anything before now but i know if i dont say it now when im thinking at least partly clearly ill end up snapping and handling it in an angry way and ill end up regretting it ok you send mixed signals sometimes things dont make sense and im really confused because you said or did one thing then turn around and say or do something else and nearly all these things are small and pretty much insignificant so ill understand if you think im being stupid and paranoid again i probably am but when theyre put together they start making an impact on me and really confusing and stressing me out
3296817 do not confirm or deny information about rrmc to reporters or radio stations
3296818 the more the public knows about this facility the more our adversaries do and the more vulnerable we become

3296822 you wait in vain for a disputation over things you are obligated to believe
3296823 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3296824 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3296825 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3296826 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3296827 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3296828 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3296829 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3296830 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3296831 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3296832 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3296833 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3296835 from the beginning of third day we realized that we needed to have someone to speak into our lives as individuals and as a band through the years we have had many people pastors and friends travel with us but of all those people nigel james has been the most important he has allowed us and reminded us to be men of god first and as a result our music and ministry have reflected that nigel has kept us accountable to each other to the church and of course to our lord he has helped us to grow in our faith and has reminded us to stay focused on our calling and on what third day is really all about

3296920 burundi has also embarked on the process now and we expect to receive the final report s from both countries in october the next step will be working out submission of reports because we have to take into consideration the internal mechanisms like parliament or cabinet before the final report is submitted to the eac secretariat

3296938 the president has further directed that unnecessary police road blocks that delay the free movement of goods be done away with while trucks with four axle loads will not be allowed on kenyan roads

3296961 the mobile telecommunications industry is understandably very concerned that a very limited analysis of this kind must be read with a full understanding and clear disclosure of the constraints of its information sources and the conclusions heavily qualified to avoid a totally misleading impression of the actual situation
3296962 unfortunately jet lag is not the only thing that knocks over australians when they return from abroad they can also be floored by their mobile phone bills

3296964 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang

3296966 our new zealand businesses have been affected throughout the period by the economic slowdown with a number of our major advertisers cutting back advertising plans

3296992 it is unacceptable for a team like ours our mood ahead of the spartak match is not the best
3296993 it makes all the hard work worthwhile i really enjoy my job the best part of it is working with the students
3296994 being able to help students through their studies is so rewarding and being recognised for the work i do is even better

3297031 when the bank boots on the other foot which we reproduce unabridged with acknowledgment
3297032 hello mrs carefree please sit down would you like a cup of coffee
3297033 im not too sure why you asked to come in but notice your business account is 12 512 this morning against an agreed facility of 12 000 i was going to drop you a line about it but now youre hear i wont have to bother
3297034 actually my visit really wasnt about that i have a cheque here in my favour for 125 381 which my aunt left me as the sole beneficiary of her estate i was about
3297035 but youve assured me in the past that you have no account with any indeed i havent but it occurred to me i might open one now
3297036 well the first question i want to ask is what will you do with it
3297037 i would credit to your account of course you might open an investment account with some of it but as a first step it would be credited to your current account
3297038 i dont think you fully understand me what i want to know is what the bank will do with my cheque when you have been prepared to let me have an advance in the past you have always required a fully document case with cash flow forecasts repayment schedules the whole caboodle i thought you might let me have a similar statement
3297039 thats whats worrying me how much has the bank lent on risky ventures has it or
3297040 well lets forget that for the moment what security are you offering
3297041 the whole of the bank or just this branch ive looked at the outside and with the
3297042 i seem to remember that you rejected out of hand a statement i made about myself to
3297043 well then what about your personal guarantee i see from the phone book that you
3297044 well we can return to that point later you mentioned putting my money in an
3297045 the banks rate on these accounts 11 5 percent at the moment and we could pay up
3297046 i couldnt afford to pay the 16 5 percent you were recently charging me and said so but you said it wasnt a question of what i could afford that was the banks rate and if you were to tell the banks directors that i couldnt afford the rate of interest and wouldnt be able to service the loan the the facility would not be approved
3297047 i think you must agree that nothing you have come up with this morning has been very satisfactory i think bank has put money into some very risky loans in the past but you were unable to give me any assurances that it wouldnt be putting my money into areas i consider equally doubtful in the future it seems you have no security that you are willing to offer and are reluctant to give me any personal guarantees on your own admission the bank is unable to afford to pay a rate of interest which gives me any real rate of return i suggest that you reconsider your position carefully and if you can come up with something more realistic come round to my office and submit your revised proposals good morning
3297048 please come in and have a seat would you like a cup of coffee
3297049 i imagine youve come in connection with my queries during our meeting yesterday
3297050 mrs carefree contrary to some alarmist media reports the position of australias
3297051 thanks you so much for troubling to provide these figures there are only one or two questions i would like you to answer the assets of our financial institutions in australia which show such astounding growth what are they made up of
3297052 well apart from the buildings land and fixtures owned by the
3297053 in other words the homes farms factories machines and other physical assets of
3297054 in other words the biggest proportion of the assets of our banks consists of the debts of the australian people backed by their property and production
3297055 oh i understand that however there seems to be some discrepancy i feel in the three
3297056 passing over that one for the moment then may i ask you this if the security for overdrafts you extend are listed in your balance sheet as assets how would you list the deposit of my 125 512 should i finally decide to make it
3297057 it would come under the heading of the banks liabilities
3297058 could you explain then how you overcome the conventional banking acts under which your bank was chartered which prohibit the lending of liabilities
3297059 well if you believe we cant lend our deposits how on earth do you
3297060 well you have the advantage of me there just what is the australian league of rights and just who discredited such theories in the thirties
3297061 i see not that your answer helps much if as you say you dont know anything about
3297062 well how do you answer its clear suggestion that trading banks create money from

3297071 i am confident the legislature will come back next week and address what is a growing fiscal crisis in this state
3297072 if theyd like to cut the whole billion they can
3297073 its important that the governor and legislature not take any actions that would force local governments to raise their local taxes to make up for a shortfall from albany
3297074 in just a few short weeks we have gone from suggestions of shared sacrifice to making hospitals and nursing homes into sacrificial lambs

3297087 weve seen burned out tanks by the side of the road it looks like a complete georgian retreat
3297088 i think the russians will continue to attack the georgian soldiers and push them back to tibilisi
3297089 video the point has been stressed that we as christians have a duty to reach the lost to save them from an eternal destination of hell for those of us who have grown comfortable with where we are at while we have saved ourselves others are lost and dying in their sins everyday resulting in an eternal destination of suffering amp separation from jesus since we know that hell is real wouldnt we want to warn as many people as possible before it is too late for them are we shy embarrassed or afraid of rejection one fact that was pointed out in the video that i wasnt too overly surprised to hear about is that only share their faith with the lost looking at the other side of this is that share their faith because of various reasons maybe some of these reasons are they dont feel called to evangelize and share the word of god it is someone elses job like a preacher evangelist youth pastor or missionary who works in the ministry full time a lack of overall conviction to reach the lost they cant reach the lost because they feel lost themselves they are a backslider with their own problems dont have the skills tools or empowerment from christ to accomplish what jesus asked us to do becoming in a sense wanna be

3297093 parents who perform regular checks will find that the problem is manageable and will save time and worry and distress to children in the long run
3297094 we are urging parents and carers to check their childrens heads for head lice and nits routinely every week the first sign that infestation is present is usually an itchy head however older children and adults may not experience any itching
3297095 it is always best to seek advice from a pharmacist or other healthcare professional who can advise on all cases as well as specific problems which might arise where for example children have asthma a pre existing skin condition or where treatment has failed previously

3297102 my grandfather farmed with horses and i always said that if i had a place of my own i wanted to work it with horses
3297103 when we moved here some of our neighbors thought we were amish once the word got out that we were going to farm with horses some of the others probably thought we were crazy
3297104 some people have started to come around and ask what wed charge to cultivate their tobacco with the horses
3297105 with the price of gas i really think theres a growing interest in horses as a supplement to tractors
3297106 we sort of look at the farm as a small country and that we have to balance the exports and imports so that hopefully we come out on the positive side
3297107 we take organic sustenance away from the land when we produce cattle and hay but we try to put back just as much organic value as we take away and ideally put back even more

3297117 too many websites sell computers and laptops without considering the needs of the customer they tell you that this laptop is the hot deal of the day or that computer is the latest in technology without anything to back it up
3297118 usually when you see something that is the hot deal of the day its really a computer or laptop they need to sell because they have too much stock or that item is about to be discontinued
3297119 i saw the need for a website that actually gives customers a chance to not only compare prices and features but one that actually puts what customers need over what someone just wants to sell

3297229 to me its a lot more like the first the terminator its very sci fi but its very character based and very concentrated its very different from the terminator movies but its like the first terminator in that time travel is involved with it but only as a plot device

3297237 this was a tragic and gruesome accident that could have and should have been avoided with proper attention and ordinary care being used by the bus operator
3297238 i have seen many wrongful death cases against governmental agencies in my 25 years of practice but this one was especially difficult to resolve considering the age of the decedent 89 and the fact that he lived alone was not a wage earner and did not provide financial support to his daughters
3297239 c oming to an agreement on value was particularly trying because all of the typical value markers were not present in this case
3297240 the fact that our legal system does not allow us to make a claim for pain and suffering on behalf of the decedent in a wrongful death case coupled with the fact there was no lost income or financial support made agreeing on a dollar figure extremely difficult
3297241 we were solely left negotiating a value for the loss of the relationship our clients had with their elderly father

3297248 it no longer makes sense for people to work years at a job they may hate in order to amass a fortune before retiring and living the next 30 plus years of their lives feeling bored irrelevant and out of the mainstream
3297249 it is time to stop compartmentalizing work into the first part of our lives and leisure into the last part instead with the appropriate financial planning and the right change in attitude americans can begin living the lives they really want now not later and for those of us who simply cant afford to retire in the traditional sense its time to rethink how we approach the rest of our lives we can either sit back and give up or realize that we have the opportunity to reshape our futures

3297270 most of us dont live in brazil so we cant eat freshly picked acai and since the fruit is highly perishable it cant be transported to other countries in fresh form so the only real options are freezing the skin and pulp or freeze drying it we think freeze dried acai is the best for a number of reasons
3297271 freeze dried acai and specifically our favorite acai supplement called perfect acai is as close as most people will get to eating fresh acai berries from the amazon rainforest in brazil
3297272 the reason the perfect acai product is our favorite and our customers favorite is because this product is the purest acai supplement on the market its the most potent since its 100 pure organic acai it is also priced the best by far
3297273 perfect acai is the perfect acai product because it fits all of our essential criteria for selecting a quality acai product which includes potency purity and price
3297274 an informed acai berry consumer is our best customer whenever you have an exciting new product like this and the ensuing hype the inevitable health food imposters will start to appear and that has already begun
3297275 blame your beauty for my boldness if i have displeased you
3297276 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3297277 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3297278 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3297279 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3297280 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3297281 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3297282 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
3297283 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
3297284 in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
3297285 senator bayh has shown the judgment that we need to admit that mistakes were made and we need to learn from them
3297286 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad
3297287 we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
3297288 he has got hollywood good looks and he speaks well he would be very loyal
3297289 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have
3297290 i didnt even know we were going to do it
3297291 i never even thought about it the coaches came to me before the game and said what do you think about a shift i said ill leave it up to you guys you know the spray charts better than i do and it helped me twice
3297292 hes a great hitter and he can drive in runs and hes still a pup too
3297293 but if hes going to roll it over to the right side sure you play as many guys over there as you can but they do such a great job of manufacturing runs you can hit 240 and still drive in 100 thats telling you that their team is operating well
3297294 we were coming off a couple of heartbreakers ourselves so i think guys were a little determined to finish this one
3297295 utley gave him a great battle but i swung horrible both pitches were sliders and i just didnt get good wood on it i was swinging over balls and grounding out all night
3297296 so if he was going to the bathroom he takes his jersey off to do it
3297297 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3297298 kendrick had a tough inning and it got him in trouble
3297299 but thats a tough lineup now with ramirez and blake and mannys always tough with the bases loaded
3297300 the word is like fire hidden in my bones and i cannot contain it
3297301 did i not heal ten but how come only one returns a samaritan to give thanks to god

3297303 australian consumers have been paying much more for their credit than uk and us consumers this will hopefully become a thing of the past if the current credit report proposals set out by the alrc are acted upon quickly
3297304 this is proven to be the most valuable data for spotting consumers falling into financial difficulty and without it lenders cannot lend as responsibly as they could
3297305 it is a ludicrous claim by some commentators that giving lenders access to more comprehensive credit report data will lead to reckless lending
3297306 to drive down the cost of credit legislators need to allow lenders to share credit payment performance data with the credit reference agencies
3297307 at the moment australian lenders and consumers are flying blind comparatively speaking
3297308 organic beauty products have a reputation of being watery earthy and lackluster when really things have come a long way in the world of organic cosmetics skin care is important to most people especially women and it is also important that they know they have the option to use high quality luxury products that work just as well as their traditional products but contain none of the toxic ingredients

3297321 there is no question that the current housing market has created problems for some families and tremendous opportunities for others
3297322 there are so many fantastic buying opportunites out there right now im personally trying to raise 10 million in capital to expand my own investment portfolio
3297323 absolutely but i also believe that for those that do not they may fail to include into their buying decision the vital role that population trends have on our economy and the county in which we live it is by carefully analyzing these figures that we can reasonably predict future housing demands
3297324 with an increase in future housing demands and a limited supply of land to build on existing home prices are likely to appreciate in the foreseeable future
3297325 investors recognize this and are patient enough to wait awhile to reap the rewards your average homebuyer is more emotionally connected with the day to day value versus the future value thus missing out on future equity appreciation
3297326 population has increased by 36 6 since 2000 making prince william county the states second most populous county
3297327 its the basic laws of supply and demand at work not a carnival sideshow involving smoke and mirrors
3297328 in the first year the x rays looked perfect we have revised four that did not have any radiolucent lines or migration and john moreland revised one these early cups fooled us but the symptoms were so classic for a loose implant that we operated on the patients when we hit on the edge of the cup it would just pop free as time goes by the cups begin developing radiolucent lines we now have one cup at two years that has actually migrated a short distance it has tilted into varus we do not believe the fixation surface is good on these cups also there is a circular cutting surface on the periphery of the cup that we believe prevents the cup from fully seating we stopped using the cup after the first revisions

3297341 however after a workout our body works harder to do this usually resulting in noticeable perspiration those embarrassing rings of wetness in the underarm area of our clothes and not to mention the soggy feeling in our shoes
3297342 one of the most important issues with ringing in the ears is the fact that it is traumatic to the person suffering from it and it often affects their family or other close relationships too
3297343 the sufferer starts to believe he or she is crazy because the sound is heard clearly by them but when they ask a spouse friend or anyone around them that person does not hear this sound

3297353 i would love to do another album right now though id like to focus on developing something to direct
3297354 johanssons voice is unremarkable and her pitch sometimes unsteady shes a faintly goth marilyn manson lost in a sonic fog
3297355 the album is ultimately too ethereal for its own good
3297356 every song is like every other song even the ones that sound different
3297357 i think people from watching the simple life where i was playing this airhead rich brat kind of character years later people still picture me like that even though im completely different from that
3297358 just getting a role like this is huge for me because i always get offered the same role basically playing myself
3297359 but this is different i had loads of auditions to do for singing and dancing and acting luckily i nailed them all
3297360 the son of a gun is nothing but a tailor
3297361 isnt it romantic soon i will have found some girl that i adore isnt it romantic while i sit around my love can scrub the floor
3297362 isnt it romantic he will hear my call and bend his royal knee isnt it romantic hell be strong and tall and yet a slave to me
3297363 i just think for too many people celebrity becomes a way of life instead of a job but i think the thing for me is that i prefer the quieter things in life
3297364 at the end of the day i want to go to dinner and watch a movie i dont want to go to a club and not wear panties
3297365 i crashed a moped on the first day of shooting into america and into an ancient stone wall

3297380 they take extraordinary measures to avoid it if faced with the object of fear they may become unable to perform even normal tasks and get panicky break into a sweat experience rapid heartbeats and even difficulty in breathing
3297381 instead of self help seeking the help of mental health professionals is recommended for early diagnosis intervention and relapse prevention strategies
3297382 if you notice avoidance reactions excessive anxiety distress associated with anxiety secondary depression and disruption of daily activities and interference with work school performance you need to seek medical help
3297383 the idea is to systematically desensitise the person about the object or situation he fears
3297384 banks like morgan stanley and merrill lynch are playing musical chairs
3297385 why are they doing this they want to keep the talent
3297386 some are being told i dont care if your wife has to stay here this is what you have to do
3297387 ive spoken to people who three or four years ago literally refused to relocate now theyre open to moving
3297388 they do not see growth or change in this market in the near future
3297389 in the past everything was done out of new york and that was the place to be
3297390 but now everyone has decided to go local and to go quite aggressively
3297391 people understand that this is important its clear that growing our franchises in key emerging markets is an important strategic priority
3297392 pools of capital will move to where the industry sees an expansion of opportunities
3297393 i dont know whether its as much theres not enough to do here so well go somewhere else
3297394 rather its more of a reflection of our clients and the growing businesses in china india and middle east
3297395 is there a set time that i expect to be in asia
3297396 not really i could see spending my whole career here
3297397 hugged my niece and said she was also his daughter and cried
3297398 some of them criminals are taken to the jails but because they belong to the commanders they pay money and are set free
3297399 families are trusting the security forces and reporting these incidents
3297400 its because of the impunity given to these warlords for such a long period of time
3297401 children struggle with the thoughts of change and unknown demands the same way adults do
3297402 weve all experienced that dreaded shift from vacation to work and its the same feeling for children heading back to school transition anxieties are normal and to be expected
3297403 and too much pressure at any time can inhibit performance
3297404 with more and more women working to balance their careers family and their homes there doesnt seem to be much time to keep the car interior tidy in fact it may be the last priority on the to do list
3297405 in many cases the family van or car is moms mobile office or even dining room so it needs to be clean and orderly to relieve some of the pressures of everyday life
3297406 i am aware of this positive dope test all i know is that it was an out of competition test that took place some time last week
3297407 she arrived in the first group of spanish athletes on july 31 it seems the same day she arrived she had a drug test and after that had a panic attack and asked the cycling federation to be allowed return to madrid
3297408 even though her state of health is good she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the village
3297409 at the same time im looking forward to it just in the fact that ive known for a long time i wanted to be in the army and serve my country
3297410 man that was tough because its what he wanted to do but i knew it was a mistake
3297411 ive tried to protect him for 24 years and now i guess its his turn
3297412 im not going to lie and say its easy preparing to go to iraq
3297413 but at the same time everyones here because we chose to be we made that choice and we decided these are the sacrifices were going to make
3297414 my wife and i got married about five or six months ago
3297415 im going to spend my first anniversary away from her thats going to be hard for both of us
3297416 you dont want to think about it but its reality
3297417 when you hear about women who are widows at 23 with a baby you dont want that to be you being only 23 and sending your husband off to war is a terrifying thought but its his job and its what hes always wanted to do
3297418 what i try to tell my wife before i go is just live your life as if i was not around which is true
3297419 i dont want her to miss me everyday dont think about me all the time she needs to just kinda carry on with her life as its supposed to be
3297420 you know you want to get the same person back that you sent
3297421 i know that is tough for a lot of soldiers after being in a combat situation to return with the same kind of heart that they went with
3297422 zachs just such a good person that we just want that same person to come back whole in all ways physically and mentally
3297423 peoples lives depend on it and thats really scary to think that whether i say do this or do that someone could potentially get out just fine or be seriously injured
3297424 most people as soon as they come home at the end of the day their professional life stops and their personal life begins but for us its not that easy
3297425 its going to be really hard but really worth it

3297433 childhood bereavement in the 21st century spectrums of support for bereaved children and those who care for them
3297434 giving children and young people a voice is a key priority for me
3297435 children who are bereaved are too often left out of the wider familys grieving process i think very often we think of the adult first of all and not the young people that are involved
3297436 conferences like this are about educating the adults that come into contact with those young people and showing how they can better understand what it is actually like for a young person who is going through that grieving process
3297437 the work of cruse help parents and carers understand the needs of children and young people and help them through this traumatic time
3297438 up to 30 000 children per year are impacted by the death of someone close to them thats a huge number of children dealing with death and loss
3297439 delivering face to face bereavement support services to children and young people alongside services for adults is an integral part of cruses work and a big aspect of that is supporting those adults who care for bereaved young people
3297440 the conference is for parents carers professionals and anyone who wants to know how they can best support children and young people who are facing the devastation of bereavement
3297441 the young people are the experts they are the ones who can tell us what its like to be bereaved and what support they need
3297442 im very concerned that people ought to be treated fairly especially people coming off fixed rates and going on to different rates
3297443 we have met the council of mortgage lenders to try to reach an agreement to ensure that people are treated fairly but if that isnt happening i will ask the fsa to pursue the matter
3297444 very low housing market activity seems certain to feed through to further depress already markedly weakening house prices
3297445 those people who took out 100 or even 100 plus mortgages within the last two years are particularly vulnerable to falling into the negative equity trap
3297446 the sheer scale of the collapse in turnover will inevitably have real implications for the economy and make it hard for the bank of england to accede to the wishes of the money markets and raise the base rate to combat inflation fears
3297447 identifying politically exposed persons peps remained difficult for 54 of participants 52 were finding it increasingly hard to maintain awareness of regulatory obligations and 52 still found the risk based approach challenging
3297448 the key concern is smaller firms may be exposing themselves to risk of fines or even prison
3297449 all firms irrespective of size are subject to the same regulations and for smaller firms compliance is a problem many sole practitioners are talking of merging to share the regulatory burden
3297450 where the risk of money laundering is low the cost of compliance should be low but that is not the case compliance is a fixed cost the same for everybody which can be ruinous for smaller firms
3297451 some of our enquirers are getting it slightly wrong and some are getting it very badly wrong in most cases clients are willing to take advice on what they are meant to be doing however there is a huge swathe of companies out there who actually refuse to accept what their obligations are under the new legislation
3297452 evidence of a systematic breach of the regulations in about 11 of firms
3297453 the money laundering laws affect all areas of practice just as they apply to members of the public
3297454 it has been a long struggle due to the changes in joshuas health over the years and arguments have been ongoing between statutory services as to whom would fund his care
3297455 im happy the compensation awarded will provide my son with the care he deserves for the remainder of his life
3297456 ive had to fight tooth and nail to get the care he needs and i feel like hes missed out on a lot hes not even had a holiday for example but at least well both get some independence from each other now i want to be joshuas mum and his friend not just his nurse
3297457 its a huge relief knowing he will have everything he needs now but all this time has been taken deciding what is reasonable care for him but his needs are constantly changing how can they ask what is reasonable when it is the hospital that jeopardised his life
3297458 pat has always been joshuas main carer and she knows what he needs having the money means she will be able to take the lead in all the decisions about his care and other people can take over the day to day things pat has devoted her life to looking after joshua and she needs a life too now
3297459 joshuas catastrophic injuries are a result of negligence of the maternity staff at the burnley general hospital and were entirely avoidable

3297803 i was always amazed at how beautiful the materials were and the fact that they came straight out of the earth or bottom of the sea i still get that feeling today with our new designs combining the art of jewelry design and the technology involved with the production process is still very challenging and rewarding even 30 plus years later
3297804 while many u s jewelry manufacturers have found it more profitable to farm work out to other countries weve relios chosen to stay and uphold our made in the usa value system and its paid off
3297805 of course there are certain concessions weve had to make there are hardly any stone cutters left in the u s so many of our stones and beads are sourced worldwide but everything else is done right here at our albuquerque factory from design modeling the original and casting to stone setting and assembly all right here under one roof it helps us serve our customers better to have that kind of quality control

3297856 when i sent my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start
3297857 yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there
3297858 i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it
3297859 somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it anymore
3297860 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world

3297864 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3297865 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses
3297866 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3297867 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3297868 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3297869 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3297870 if action is not taken it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices

3297872 it complements our entries into china and the us giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world
3297873 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3297874 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3297875 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim

3297893 did you ever hear of a man named charles moreton
3297894 back in 1689 he made a barter with the devil he wanted to be an explorer so he could help his country he saw it raped and pillage and ravished by disease he wanted to go off and find something that would solve his country of disease he travelled to the west coast of america and found something it was a plant the earliest form of aspirin
3297895 well it wouldve been if he made it back to england a freak storm in the ocean killed him and his whole crew of course that was orchestrated by master he upheld his deal charles found explored and found something of great use to his fellow countryman
3297896 in charless case it was simply the master being the master you see charles was a loving man who cared about helping those around him the master had to do what he was expected to do
3297897 you are selfish arrogant and above all else oblivious you seem to think the world owes you every thing because you are a product of a broken home you want all the attention but unwilling to do the work satan rarely takes pleasure in his work hes forced you know but in these recent times people like you who are more determined to talk about yourselves and dont care about those around you its fun to watch you stumble and fall try and fail you dont care about the way your world acts or how you can help it you only care about you its sickening

3297906 this ground breaking discovery confirms what researchers and experts have believed for some time mitochondrial disease is not rare
3297907 we now know that 1 in 200 people carry the mutation for this horrible debilitating disease this discovery underscores the need for additional research funding to help better diagnose and treat affected individuals and to learn more about how mitochondrial dysfunction is connected to other diseases
3297908 the demonstration by dr chinnery and colleagues that at least one in 200 newborns harbor known pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3297909 this new observation augments the rapidly expanding body of evidence indicating that common mitochondrial dna lineages modulate the risk for developing a wide variety of diseases including diabetes cardiovascular disease parkinson disease alzheimer disease various cancers as well as longevity
3297910 dr chinnerys research raises many new questions none of which can be answered without additional dollars allocated for research into mitochondrial disease and dysfunction
3297911 this line of research holds great promise ultimately the investment we make may enable doctors and researchers to transform medicine benefiting not only those suffering from mitochondrial disease but the many millions of americans who suffer from the wide range of diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction
3297912 and we have something more sure the prophetic word to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts knowing this first of all that no prophecy of scripture comes from someones own interpretation for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man but men spoke from god as they were carried along by the holy spirit

3297921 ajantha was brilliant adding a different dimension to the bowling attack

3297923 in terms of the bowling obviously mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets

3297925 the batsmen didnt put up a good show here and it probably cost us the series
3297926 these guys should all be required to report and should be keeping us notified where they are at all times full stop
3297927 this committee as envisioned was to provide parliamentary and independent advice to the prime minister
3297928 if its cabinet people on it the suspicion has to be that theyre not there providing independent advice theyre just there as mouthpieces for the prime ministers office

3298084 i wanted to keep the pressure on him i didnt want him to set up because hes a very patient fencer
3298085 i guess i just made a strategic error after the break at 8 5 where he changed somewhat waiting for me to use my aggression against me looking back on it i can really learn from this i shouldve finished the match when i was up 9 5 ill be thinking about that for a while
3298086 maybe i shouldve been fencing with a cast on just as a preventive measure
3298087 but it just kind of snapped back so it hurt but with the adrenaline going i didnt want to stop and lose momentum
3298088 i guess the referee saw it differently than how i felt the actions were

3298103 there used to be infamous ghoondas but they were nothing compared to the hooligans of today young men used to get into drunken brawls and gang fights mostly over women and politics but guns were hardly ever used they used fists knifes chains but nobody ever knew what a tt pistol or a kalashnikov was
3298104 if you go through the economic stats of the era you will find that there was a lot less economic disparity between classes in pakistan the rat race to outdo one another even if that meant committing crime to become rich basically started in the 80s when money from pakistanis working in the gulf nations started to pour in the era saw the emergence of a growing class of the nuevo rich and society started to transform into something totally new it became more hypocritical and amoral

3298114 there will be no significant material and economic progress in muslim communities until the muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths
3298115 i dont believe there are moderate muslims because in islam you have to believe in every teaching as a holy teaching you cannot change you have to accept it the way it is because otherwise simply you are not a muslim
3298116 the koran remains for all muslims not just fundamentalists the uncreated word of god himself it is valid for all times and places its ideas are absolutely true and beyond all criticism to question it is to question the very word of god and hence blasphemous a muslims duty is to believe it and obey its divine commands

3298118 there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence about gaming addiction said loton in a statement
3298119 online forums abound with tales of people who cant get off the computer but from a clinical point of view an addiction is a mental illness with very serious consequences in this context we need to ask whether gaming is responsible for causing peoples lives to fall apart in the same way we see with gambling alcohol or drug addiction
3298120 we also looked at whether problematic play is impelled by social difficulties by using a multiple regression analysis to see if high scores on the social skills and self esteem scales could predict problematic playing scores
3298121 our findings strongly suggest that gaming doesnt cause social problems and social problems are not driving people to gaming

3298145 the idea that developing countries should feed themselves is an anachronism from a bygone era they could better ensure their food security by relying on u s agricultural products which are available in most cases at lower cost 3
3298146 we did not think that the human costs of these programs could be so great and the economic gains would be so slow in coming 4
3298147 seeming blindness of the fund and bank to the failure of their approach to sub saharan africa persisted even as the studies of the imf and the world bank themselves failed to elicit positive investment effects 5
3298148 the parastatal sector will continue to pose risks to the successful implementation of the 2002 03 budget government interventions in the food and other agricultural markets crowd out more productive spending

3298163 whenever i get my pension i have to carefully distribute each and every cent so that all in the family gets some share said ms shabalala
3298164 obviously my pension is unable to cover buying the food for such a big family from my pension at the end of the month i try to buy basic foodstuff like rice flour maize meal oil and sugar these are the kind of things that should last us for the whole month but that does not really happen sometimes i am left with nothing and i cant even go to church as taxi fares are also increasing with everything else
3298165 our life situation just keeps on getting worse i only wish that things were different i am old and sick and have hardly anything to eat because of rising food prices my daughters and grandchildren are looking for employment but that is not helping as well instead it is emptying our pockets for bus fare and photocopying faxing and posting of cvs i even tried looking for land in order to plant vegetables but have not yet succeeded every now and then i try to encourage my family to boil food as that will save oil things are really bad
3298166 when i arrived i could afford my own room but today its almost impossible i barely managed to pay my rent most of my money goes in food
3298167 after the economic crisis of 2001 all of us became economy experts and this had a direct effect on my life they say the transportation costs had raised and this triggered the food prices come with me ill show you
3298168 look you know in turkey there are typical things we eat i will just ask him about these only
3298169 bread from ytl 0 40 0 32 to ytl 0 50 0 40 sugar ytl 1 80 1 45 to ytl 2 15 1 73 5 kg olive oil ytl 35 28 to ytl 41 33 5 kg sunflower oil ytl 20 16 to ytl 28 90 23 rice ytl 2 95 2 37 to ytl 3 75 3 etc
3298170 you dont need to be a genius to see the problem today my monthly expenses meaning just my basic living expenses have gone up to ytl 1 300 1044 in total this is more than my income this means we are having a diet but an unhealthy one
3298171 i dont like the ideology of the ruling adalet ve kalkinma partisi akp and prime minister erdogan but because they did well with the economy i voted for them the last time but their second term is totally different to their first term after the 2001 crisis the priority was economy now god knows what their priorities are
3298172 a few good people help me with it otherwise i could not make it
3298173 one kilo of meat is egp40 7 but my monthly income is just egp200 37 and the prices of everything else is increasing like sugar oil meat but my payment has not increased it was increased a year ago from egp150 28 to egp200 37 and it remains there honestly we have not tried the apricots this year still one kilo is egp4 0 75 and i have growing boys and one kilo of such a fruit will not be enough they used to like it but now i have to substitute fruit with other basic items
3298174 life is very tough for us here i dont know how to make ends meet even though i am working hard every day cleaning other peoples houses i am counting every cent but food amp transport and rent are exceeding the little i am making
3298175 buyers do not understand that the prices are not under my control i go with my husband every morning to mandi wholesale market for vegetable fruit and grains on a bus to buy the little that we can from his daily earnings which range from rs65 to rs100 1 50 2 50 per day these days we buy only five kilos of each vegetable because people everywhere are cutting corners to make ends meet then the cost of bus tickets has also increased by one rupee the rent for the shop is fixed at rs500 and i suspect that it might also increase in the days to come i do not understand how i will be able to recover the cost if i sell for less i also have to feed my family
3298176 the prices of oil pulses wheat and salt all indispensable ingredients in indian cooking have doubled in just one year in just two months sugar price has gone up from rs16 0 37 to rs20 0 46 per kg most of the spices cost twice as much today as they did a year ago if food prices rise further we cannot possibly cut down more on our basic diet all the family members will have to work and contribute to the family income
3298177 we used to pay about rmb200 30 for gas everyday and now we need to pay rmb250 36 or more which is almost one third of our daily turnover apart from the cost of other things we will lose rmb40 50 5 7 per day rmb700 800 100 120 per month and rmb8000 10000 1200 1500 per year after the oil price markup
3298178 in singapore if you have no money you better not fall sick it would be better to die than to be suffering broke and being a burden to everyone else around you
3298179 everyone is doing something illegal to cut costs it is a risk i am willing to take

3298181 the competition in berlin is tough too many of us migrants are involved in the same business
3298182 we are angry very angry also about ourselves because we feel helpless
3298183 i cannot believe how everything became so expensive in the last year in romania nobody is dying from hunger at the moment but i feel very sad when i see my retired colleagues fighting hard to survive
3298184 in the last six months the oil price increased by over 0 30 0 47 per liter one single truck needs hundreds of liters of fuel daily then you have to think that my trucks transport mostly fruit and vegetables which in addition need to be stored in refrigerated trailers that work with fuel as well
3298185 and transporting them around is getting difficult it is a paradox that me and my family are living in everyday life on one hand i have to ask for higher transport prices in order to give my business a chance to survive and on the other i have to suffer from the same cause when going to shop at the market and my wife has to spend at least a couple of extra euros just to buy bread just to buy the most essential elements flour water and salt we transporters are probably going to strike again at the end of the month food is becoming so expensive that the entire population should strike

3298189 at my local the fair dinkum the barman there will buy you your 3rd drink after you buy the first two
3298190 back home in dublin theres ryans bar now the moment you set foot in the place theyll buy you a drink then another all the drinks you like then when youve had enough drinks theyll take you upstairs and see that you get laid all on the house

3298198 we see that hizbullah has been receiving many rockets including anti aircraft rockets and un resolution 1701 the ceasefire that ended the second lebanon war is not being implemented
3298199 the very fact that we are training with live fire and with every soldier fully equipped and in an officers training course
3298200 is part of a vital process led by the chief of staff this past year and a half that will bring about a change from the very foundations in our readiness and ability to carry out these operations during actual wartime if and when this is forced upon us
3298201 returning to its right values to the right training and it is our obligation as a government to make sure that the necessary means are available to carry out these exercises intensively and correctly
3298202 they have been receiving modern weapons including anti aircraft rockets and the ceasefire is not being implemented what are we supposed to do its no coincidence that we are training here in the golan heights not far from lebanon so intensively and on such a large scale
3298203 we are doing what we are supposed to be doing regarding the rest i prefer not to talk about it but rather if and when the need arises simply to do it
3298204 but also with the help of heavier warheads some that can reach beer sheva dimona and the negev thus that from this standpoint the entire country is in their range

3298232 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3298233 georgian government officials used to tell me that they wanted to model their army after the idf
3298234 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
3298235 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
3298236 they got into an adventure that i wouldnt have chosen to get into based on the level of professionalism i saw in my visits to the georgian army
3298237 this is an army that was in the process of disintegrating over 15 or 16 years
3298238 this process required reconstruction and thats where the israelis entered the picture along with companies from other countries verything was very very basic we dealt mainly with basic training for the units it will take a long time until the military forces there will advance to a high professional level the georgian army cannot under any circumstances be a serious rival to the russians at present
3298239 georgia is a small country with barely 4 5 million people
3298240 they have a small army to be honest not much different from that of a third world country
3298241 the georgians began reorganizing their army in 2002 with american assistance since the collapse of the soviet union in the early 1990s the georgian army has primarily been comprised of remnants of red army units
3298242 they have stayed in regular contact with the coastguard since departing from stornoway and they made the correct decision to contact us and ask for help when they both became unwell

3298252 the fact that theyve not revised down their full year estimates is a big point i think the first quarter numbers are within expectations and beat low end estimates

3298255 as the approved person at orchard house mortgages limited orchard house mr james had overall responsibility for ensuring that orchard house conducted its business with integrity
3298256 he showed a lack of honesty and integrity in relation to his own personal financial dealings given our concerns about brokers use of false payslips on customers mortgage applications we applied the same standards to him and we concluded that he could not be trusted to occupy any position in relation to customers mortgage applications
3298257 the standard factors which usually determine the rates at which mortgage rates are set including bank base rate swap rates and libor rates are all much lower than this time last year yet the rates on offer are much higher
3298258 as house prices continue to fall and the risk of default increases the lenders are pricing more for risk and as a result these standard factors are not quite as influential on the rates as they once were
3298259 the number of products will steadily increase and rates will lower with increased competition between lenders
3298260 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey

3298265 contains appeals not to observe laws of non muslim states
3298266 as muslims we have fully integrated into british society but we have no desire to assimilate to an inferior culture
3298267 there will be no significant material and economic progress in muslim communities until the muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths
3298268 i dont believe there are moderate muslims because in islam you have to believe in every teaching as a holy teaching you cannot change you have to accept it the way it is because otherwise simply you are not a muslim
3298269 the koran remains for all muslims not just fundamentalists the uncreated word of god himself it is valid for all times and places its ideas are absolutely true and beyond all criticism to question it is to question the very word of god and hence blasphemous a muslims duty is to believe it and obey its divine commands

3298275 is forcing us to consider the possibility that some cosmic dark energy exists that opposes the self attraction of matter and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate
3298276 the universe is made mostly of dark matter and dark energy
3298277 how much matter is in the universe is the expansion rate slowing down or speeding up and is the universe flat
3298278 these two legs of the cosmic triangle agree with the evidence from the cmb that the universe is flat
3298279 this is a remarkable agreement for these early days of empirical cosmology
3298280 but its a good way to portray the quantities in these comparisons and its fun for people who like to plot the possibilities
3298281 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3298282 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3298283 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3298284 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3298285 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3298286 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3298287 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3298288 i cant remember things i just dont know what to do
3298289 wrong decisions get us blacklisted which one will rage tonight
3298290 you know i was a fool when i married you

3298293 okay give me a million dollars and beat me till im half dead
3298294 yeah so this one time i paid this hooker 40 bucks to go down on her
3298295 the sharp spike up in inflation in july increases the risk that the bank of england will raise interest rates despite the fact that the economy seems more likely than not to contract over the second half of the year
3298296 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3298297 aggressor in south ossetia has been punished and has incurred very significant losses
3298298 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me
3298299 it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3298300 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable because of alochol consumption
3298301 obviously i cant comment on the individual cases but as i understand it the criminal injurires compensation authority have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied
3298302 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3298303 i went online in hong kong to check the vacancies and then chased them up by phone when i got home from travelling
3298304 it was early september by then so i was worried about finding a place but when i spoke to the people at greenwich they took all my details added up my points and offered me a place there and then
3298305 they emailed over a form and within days it was all confirmed
3298306 people said i wouldnt get my first choice because i was so late but i did
3298307 it seems like there are always last minute places available because people drop out or dont turn up
3298308 some of the more elite universities will have made offers much earlier and may have limited or no accommodation left but were very clearing friendly
3298309 we are geared up to do the majority of our business through clearing so we can take applications and make accommodation allocations speedily it may seem late to you but this is what we do every year
3298310 the opportunity to study is what higher education is all about
3298311 students need to make sure they pick the right course for them first and foremost
3298312 the accommodation can all be sorted out in days if not hours in some cases
3298313 you can phone up in the morning and by the afternoon the contract is in the post the main message is dont panic we have ample accommodation to meet everyones needs
3298314 most first years do want a place in halls as its a good place to meet other people in similar situations and establish friendships early on
3298315 we can get it all arranged via email in a couple of days so people really dont have to worry
3298316 students are paying customers in the housing marketplace so they have the right to expect certain standards
3298317 if your hall of residence is full make sure you add your name to the waiting list because there will always be a proportion of students who dont turn up or drop out in the first month
3298318 check out noticeboards and online forums for flat sharing opportunities as current students will know where there are vacancies
3298319 and the student union is usually an incredible source of local information
3298320 all the landlords with the agency are signed up to a code of practice
3298321 but wed still advise students to come into the advice centre to get the contract checked out
3298322 i knew i wasnt going to do exceptionally well in my a levels as my as results hadnt been great i had previously thought about doing a nursing diploma but i decided i wanted to do social work and needed to go to university for that so i decided to take a gap year and get some relevant experience i spent the year with csv volunteering in the uk and helping children with disabilities it is not a nine to five day when you volunteer obviously you go to the childs house which means you spend at least two hours a day with a child and then you could spend the afternoon writing up the case in the records but some days id spend six hours with the child in question im now at chichester university doing a ba in social work the gap year really helped apart from helping me get into uni in the first place it will also give me an advantage in the jobs market for instance this year ive been able to work with adults who have disabilities which i couldnt have done if i hadnt volunteered with children last year it is all going towards my career after university
3298323 after my a levels i decided university wasnt for me even though i got two as and two bs i had a clear idea of what i wanted to do and a degree wasnt necessary for my career path so i came to london i took an entry level job which i did for 10 months then an opportunity came up for a booking department post the first rung on the ladder within a small company after a year i was promoted to junior producer and at 21 to producer then i got a job freelancing at rushes one of the best established companies in london and after two months they offered me a permanent contract the only way not going to university has affected me is that i have had some funny experiences at work being the boss of people older than me for example perhaps you get promoted faster with a degree but i think companies also respond well to a good attitude and hard work i know 100 per cent that i did the right thing
3298324 you can go into the marines as early as 16 but i did two years at college on a public services course beforehand which really opened my eyes to being in the services
3298325 the best motivations to resit are where you have underachieved significantly relative to your ability or expected grades and where your options through clearing represent a significant comedown from those on which you have set your heart
3298326 the amount by which you are likely to improve your grade on resitting does not depend on the subject itself its more about the shortfall in your performance relative to ability having said that certain units within a subject may lend themselves to a resit better than others and you should explore all options in an interview with your re take college before embarking on a course
3298327 given the conceptual understanding of these subjects students can improve simply by working on practice papers when that might not be the case for a subject like english or history
3298328 i moved to crc but the large classes of 25 to 30 people made it difficult to get motivated

3298341 am auzit explozia si incercam sa vedem ce s a intamplat
3298342 pot sa va asigur ca acesta si doar acesta este obiectivul federatiei ruse
3298343 speram ca partenerii nostri internationali sa lucreze in aceasta directie
3298344 nu mai avem incredere in georgia asa ca o sa i ocupam
3298345 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3298346 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3298347 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3298348 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3298349 the operation to liberate kodori gorge has started everything is developing according to plan
3298350 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3298351 we received very reliable information that the russians decided to move towards gori thats why we decided to pull out all our troops and to relocate them to defend tbilisi
3298352 its easy to recruit because a lot of developers here are creating software for mobile devices on java for example it should be a win win situation for them since device support for windows mobile is increasing

3298362 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform
3298363 intel provides the vast majority of chipsets for its processors and following its purchase of ati amd is also moving very quickly in the same direction
3298364 this step came as a message to palestinian officials in protest against negligence of our situation by israel
3298365 reduction in force of a portion of the affected development team
3298366 today we are cancelling the career criminal project in our austin studio and there will be a reduction in headcount of about 80 people
3298367 first and foremost i want to emphasise that we are not closing the austin studio and that the studio will continue to be an important part of our product development organization
3298368 although we are cancelling a major title the other projects in development at the studio will continue and we will continue to invest in new teams and new people going forward this was a difficult decision but it is the right thing to do for the health and future of the company

3298374 todd and barb have been two of the most supportive and friendly people parents that i have ever encountered they have a genuine knack for making everyone welcome and continued their support of ucla volleyball even after wiz graduated
3298375 in four years they probably missed fewer than a half a dozen matches
3298376 they became like parents to the whole team because they were always there always supporting everyone

3298392 volatility creates great trading opportunities yet opportunities and risk go hand in hand
3298393 a spike in volatility is like a rain shower in august it brings green grass for us down the road at the point that volatility stabilizes or subsides

3298523 i think it is important as others have said and hinted at that we have long blamed everyone but ourselves for our lack of community and increasing social alienation it is not the fault of schools government etc that our society is impolite rude and self absorbed we have increasingly opted for more and more of the private world by driving around just about everywhere sticking ipods in our ear and going to our 2000 4000sq ft homes and locking the world out as we roll in the drive way living in segregated box suburbs with little to no historical continuity aesthetic or natural value contributing nothing to the community or its betterment and wanting everything in return the something for nothing mentality unfortunately this has created high rates of depression and alienation regularly solved by pill pushing anti depressants and tranquilizers instead of dealing with the reality of the situation reality is not as bad as product marketeers make it out to be try it for a change

3298529 it is very disappointing data with widespread signs of higher price pressures
3298530 it will undoubtedly convince some members of the monetary policy committee to vote for higher rates but we doubt they will reach a majority

3298532 camisa blanca falda azul con el uniforme del colegio sin pasar por casa llegaba a la sala por la tarde y ven a al rinc n en el que yo imprim a las octavillas
3298533 yo no me permit a familiaridades sin embargo le miraba la falda su hermoso color azul daba paz a mis ojos demasiado fijos en el blanco y negro del papel ciclostilado bajo la luz de ne n no era el azul de los monos obreros que sal an al aire libre desde los talleres por una huelga improvisada se lo he llevado encima y lo he aprendido despu s su falda era el azul que rodea la l mpara en la pesca nocturna del calamar de los chipirones era el azul que envuelve la luz y la acompa a mientras se hunde en el mar
3298534 aparecidos todos a la vez en el interior de una generaci n ni que nos hubi ramos dado una cita en la cuna dentro de dieciocho a os en las calles la nuestra era la primera generaci n de europa a la que a sus dieciocho a os no se la cog a por el morrillo y se la arrojaba a una guerra contra otra juventud declarada enemiga era la primera que se sacud a de encima las consecuencias desastrosas de la palabra patria por ello ramos patriotas del mundo y nos inmiscu amos en sus guerras en gran parte de nuestras octavillas estaba escrito el nombre de un lejano pa s de asia vietnam
3298535 dijo con una voz apenas m s alta que la del motor del ciclostil pero es que t no querr as ser por una vez el pr jimo para alguien apart los ojos de ella creo que me confund con las manos
3298536 la polic a dej que se fuera ella entre tanto hab a pasado del p lido al acalorado al rojo de un esfuerzo por frenar con todos los m sculos de la cara las l grimas al borde de los ojos

3298538 the recent merger with siemensvdo complemented the vision of continental to achieve a 360 perception of the environment
3298539 thus we are able to offer almost every driver assistance system i e acc stop amp go emergency brake assist collision warning lane departure warning lane keeping blind spot warning lane change assist enhanced night vision by camera controlled headlamps speed limit monitoring etc all embedded in our contiguard strategy for greater driving comfort and safety all these systems are already in or very close to series production in 2008 we are going to launch completely new radar and infrared sensors as well as new camera systems which are capable to run multiple driver assistance function lane departure warning speed limit monitoring enhanced night vision by camera controlled headlamps at the same time
3298540 our alertness assistant involves a camera mounted inside the car which monitors the driver although we do not yet a have a fixed date for its introduction there is a very high level of interest from truck and carmakers we are currently fine tuning its functionality as a camera can undertake a number of valuable and interesting features the question becomes what features must be in the first generation technology we need to strike a balance between not adding too many yet just enough to justify the additional costs involved we hope to bring the system into the market in 2010
3298541 we have the first contract for our front camera system and ldw will be one of the functions
3298542 an interesting focus today is on the fusion between functionality of the driver monitoring system and ldw system so now we have a situation where we have two cameras in the car one is looking at the driver and the other is looking at the road ahead there is currently a focus in the industry on technology and sensor fusion one of the discussed applications is the fusion of lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control where both functions provide added value to the other and also enable new features while the car now has a lot of information about its surroundings there is a danger of over loading the driver with too many warnings as a consequence he or she may over react in certain driving situations so another focus is to develop concepts how to match all the different available information and then decide on the most suitable hmi human machine interface function to apply
3298543 visiocorps camera based blind spot detection system on volvo cars has been well received in the market
3298544 the most significant advantage of our system compared to todays radar based systems is that ours provides a warning at a speed of only 10 km h whereas radar based systems typically start at 50 60 km h which means they do not react in urban areas looking ahead visiocorp see a number of advantages of camera based technology images allow interpretation and classification of any kind of object and road marking in the field of view combined with the latest development in intelligent image processing technology this opens a number of potential new applications around the vehicle as semiconductor technologies are being continuously improved visiocorps engineers are investigating the advantages and opportunities for additional applications of a new generation of camera modules using latest technologies and components
3298545 the roll out phase will start next year given that we already have some 6 8 sensors embedded around the car that can identify at low vehicle speed the vehicles immediate scenery we can use that technology to move beyond thoughts of simple parking to maneuvering
3298546 the question then becomes how can we add functionality without adding more sensors how can we add functionality to support the driver when he or she is maneuvering the car these and other questions form an important focus of our current research
3298547 seat belts for example are clearly regarded as safety systems as they can save lives in the event of an accident but some people might feel safer wearing seat belts and for this reason drive faster we think these discussions are very important to better understand the consequences of introducing new features and identify solutions to avoid negative side effects for example by locating the warning lights of the blind spot detection system at certain spots nearby or on the exterior mirrors our system prompts the drivers to turn and actually pay attention to the mirrors we have received feedback that our blind spot detection systems even trained people to pay more attention to the blind spot zones because the systems continuously indicated hazardous situations which they would not have been aware of without such as system
3298548 not only could they but they probably should and the sooner the better
3298549 no in vehicle sensor can see what is not in their line of sight for example driving around the bend and straight into a line of cars that have rear ended each other is not going to be solved by anything that is not able to see whats happening beyond the next curve you are approaching for this intelligent traffic systems that have eyes from above are a feasible and an excellent solution naturally a better connected road scene wifi bluetooth or some other type of wireless communication would make a huge difference in road safety terrible accidents that occur in tunnels sometimes involving tens of vehicles and always deadly can be prevented altogether if all cars know that one car is now stuck in the tunnel ahead
3298550 we think that parking assist system in five years full speed range adaptive cruise control system in ten years and road to vehicle and vehicle to vehicle communication systems in 15 years will become common
3298551 sensor fusions or better sensor data fusion will happen which results in a reduction of electronic units but an increase of safety and performance
3298552 the guys never gave up all our work paid off
3298553 we were confident i told them the gymnastics that youve done to this point got you here thats all you have to do and they won the bronze medal

3298565 el respeto del derecho de los cubanos que viven en el exterior a venir a cuba por parte del gobierno del pa s donde vivan no debe condicionarse a los cambios en cuba pues esto ser a redoblar el castigo a la misma v ctima pero los propios cubanos que viven fuera de cuba deben ser solidarios con sus hermanos y reclamar todos los derechos de los cubanos que vivimos aqu pues as est n reclamando los derechos propios
3298566 si el miedo les alcanza hasta all afuera y creen que deben pagar con el precio del silencio si no el de la complacencia simulada para que les permitan entrar como visitantes a su propio pa s entonces s lo contribuir n a la prolongaci n de la humillaci n de todos

3298579 our initial focus will be the worldwide problem of breast cancer the dilemma that all women have is that having x rays to detect breast cancer may cause breast cancer the omnibody scan is a non invasive tool that will have no harmful side effects the earlier that breast cancer is detected equates to a much higher chance of survival especially with inflammatory breast cancer ibc
3298580 we wish to express our sincere thanks to our investors and shareholders for their patience in allowing us to finally introduce the omnibody scan with the proper fda approvals and technology this is the product that we wanted from the beginning while it is manufactured by a different company than the original version it adheres to the highest standards of thermography it is easy to use and offers a very high grade of technology and quality this is a great market for american healthchoice to enter and while it took longer than anticipated we have great expectations on the results both short and long term
3298581 the company continues it litigation against texas infrared the original manufacturer in the matter of the omnibody scan and we anticipate an outcome favorable to american healthchoice

3298599 hit the roof and said that she planned to sue
3298600 hi we feel really bad but neither brad nor the programmer have any other ideas for you to try over and above what i have given you
3298601 she would drive over to inverness fly down from there and spend three days a week in london
3298602 not surprisingly she eventually tired of that routine and decide to retire and that was when inner sound was started it was basically a community group and we have grown year on year and are now about 50 strong
3298603 we started off just in plockton then we did broadford as well and then sabhal mor ostaig and the aros centre in portree
3298604 it has grown steadily and as the company has enlarged it has become more difficult to accommodate us all which is why we decided to do a show at eden court which was closed for a substantial part of the time we have been running
3298605 we did a series of concerts of secular music in churches including the famous stefanskirche and two or three others in the city
3298606 it was very successful and we are delighted to have been asked back i dont know if we would consider taking g amp s over there at some point but you never know
3298607 i suppose the biggest challenge for us is really scenery and costumes
3298608 the singing is one side of it but to put it all together for a fully staged show is a mammoth task our sets are all made specifically for each performance here on skye jewson provide support for us in the form of materials which is much appreciated
3298609 it is a job that needs doing in inverness and it is a great honour and privilege for me to do it
3298610 inverness has been growing fairly rapidly over the last 25 years and developing i think the impact it has had on the inner moray firth and the highlands has been huge and i look forward to the future where i can help that growth sustain the growth and develop inverness
3298611 if we can pull in other resources to get the flood alleviation scheme much more attractive then thats where we need to be focusing attention very quickly and i know the officials are doing that as we speak
3298612 none of us wants to be in a position whereby we are detracting from the river it is a major feature for inverness
3298613 i think everyone shares the view of architects but we have a finite budget we need to work within we need to take into account the aesthetic appearance but we need to try and ensure we can lever as much money in as possible
3298614 there is a huge amount of infrastructure investment needed in inverness but how we finance that is a huge question particularly in the present climate
3298615 it is a problem for us and one we need to get in context
3298616 we need a balanced view to it highland council has a revenue budget of 560 million but we actually spend 750 million
3298617 that is a huge driver for the highland economy most of it is spent on delivering services and that is our main objective but there are opportunities for us to look to see how we can target that spend
3298618 last year we could not build enough houses and now we cant sell them
3298619 it has created a lot of jobs in the highland area over the last year or so and we will be looking at that and getting involved directly with contractors to see what can be done
3298620 the difficulty is most of the targets we have as a council for delivering affordable housing are tied up in private sector building and if they cannot build we need to see what we can do in the public sector
3298621 we do not know where we are going in relation to the economy right now
3298622 there may be opportunities but we need to look at it from a broader view point
3298623 what weve learned previously is when you are building rapidly you need to supply more than houses you need services play parks and infrastructure partially built sites have their own problems
3298624 you do get to meet some interesting people so im looking forward to that
3298625 they are interfering with peoples freedom of movement spelt out in the constitution
3298626 i personally do not think they deserve the certification as they cant fulfil their obligations im a dissatisfied customer because i have dutifully filed my returns and have not received my refund now im owed sh72 000
3298627 despite religiously filing my tax returns indicating that i qualify for refunds ive not got anything the old income tax department didnt have to be reminded to pay
3298628 the last time i got a refund from kra the money was simply wired to my bank account whose details they have they owe me refunds for at least four years
3298629 were already working on it and it will be launched soon
3298630 it will be used to notify customers on impending power supply interruptions and also to alert them to pay their bills before the deadline to avoid power disconnection that is inconveniencing to everyone

3298632 between the ice of recession and the fire of inflation
3298633 that makes decisions on the people for the people instead of the people a politics that holds that in the political order all sections of the community have been assigned their proper place
3298634 for us street traders being a stakeholder is a slavery term this is because government and big business think for us plan for us and all we are left with is to fit in their plan and do as we told even if we feel hurt and oppressed by their plans
3298635 there are two ways of counting the parts of the community the first only counts empirical parts actual groups defined by differences in birth by different functions locations and interests that constitute the social body the second counts in addition a part of the no part we will call the first police and the second politics there is politics inasmuch as the people refers to subjects inscribed as a supplement to the count of the parts of society a specific figure of the part of those who have no part politics exists as a deviation from this normal order of things it is this anomaly that is expressed in the nature of political subjects who are not social groups but rather forms of inscription of the ac count of the unaccounted for the poor does not designate an economically disadvantaged part of the population it simply designates the category of peoples who do not count those who have no qualifications to part take no qualification for being taken into account
3298636 today the great majority of people do not have a name the only name available is excluded which is the name of those who do not have a name today the great majority of humanity counts for nothing
3298637 we are being used under the banner of being stakeholders whenever the government makes a policy they consult us individually and say different things to us having caused enough chaos among us they say they have consulted stakeholders whereas those among us who are not well learned they are often ignored
3298638 to educate the masses politically does not mean cannot mean making a political speech what it means is to try relentlessly and passionately to teach the masses that everything depends on them that if we stagnate it is their responsibility and if we go forward it is due to them too that there is no such thing as a demiurge that there is no famous man who will take responsibility for everything but that the demiurge is the people themselves and the magic hands are finally only the magic hands of the people
3298639 it seems that the poor and excluded are perpetually being fragmented by the authorities in the name of being stakeholders
3298640 an emancipatory politics is universal and not linked to any specific interest it is for all never for some it follows we can say that for badiou emancipatory politics does not represent anyone politics begins when one decides not to represent victims but to be faithful to those events during which victims politically assert themselves politics in no way represents the proletariat class or nation it is not a question of whether something which exists may be represented rather it concerns that through which something comes to exist which nothing represents and which purely and simply presents its own existence
3298641 civil society citizenship and the politics of the im possible rethinking militancy in africa today
3298642 the nation does not exist in a programme which has been worked out by revolutionary leaders
3298643 it was clear to all that you have to approach it from the bottom start small in a form like struggling against baig mlaba etc because in no ways you can jump into the world bank while failing to identify a close enemy that you can see touch an enemy that denies us a right to life thus as much as all debates are good fighting only by talking does not take us much further sometimes we need to strengthen our muscles for an action debate that is a living debate that does not only end on theories zikode 2007
3298644 we must rid ourselves of the very western very bourgeois and therefore contemptuous attitude that the masses are incapable of governing themselves
3298645 having observed social formations and their politics i have this question to ask why is it that every time the poor come together ngos and leftists jump in and take over in their conventional praxis they provide capacity building whereas my observation is that capacity building demobilises people it takes them away from their original agenda
3298646 nigeria the country with vast natural resources that could serve as a large base for commercial agricultural activities and turning it into completely self sufficient on food supplies imports 3 billion worth of rice wheat and fish when you think about nigerias geographical location and land and water resources the thought of importing rice wheat and fish to this country is almost inconceivable according to minister of agriculture and water resources dr abba sayyadi ruma nigeria has the capacity to produce five million metric tonnes of fish but could only achieve a dismal 500 metric tonnes annually apart from poor resource management here is another reason behind the stalemating agricultural development of not nigeria alone but of many other african countries the lack of the desire on the part of the local commercial banks to participate in agricultural development thus significantly limiting or degrading to zero the access to the sources of financing for medium and small scale farmers
3298647 weeks ago michael jana a lecturer at chancellor college wrote in defense of the involvement of traditional leaders in local governance his argument was that malawi does not need ward councilors because there is an established local structure of traditional leaders
3298648 generally africans have a vexing tendency to always dwell on the bad worse and worst comparison they rarely dwell on positive comparison that is the good better and best situations when established dictators are under all kinds of pressure to relinquish power fellow africans come out with defensive negative comparisons insinuating that these autocrats are not worse than their contemporaries it is like the student who took the last but one position in his end of year class exams but was quick to point out that at least he wasnt the last in the class when we decry the dictatorial rule of the biya regime some analysts rush to point out that he is not worse than his neighbours when there is an opportunity to oust dictators like mugabe of zimbabwe who has plunged his country into an economic quagmire coupled with extreme brutalization of his people because of their political opinions fellow africans come out with all kinds of negative comparisons and hypotheses i strongly believe that any pressure to force a dictator to relinquish power no matter where it is coming from should not be compromised any african dictator who is forced out of power brings a smile to at least one hopeless african africas future rests not on this cream of dictators they are of no use they cant bring the momentum africa needs to move from its present inertia to a more progressive track comparable to the south east asian boom the talk about african unity remains a fictional gaffe except these greedy autocrats quit the biyas obiang nguemas bongo qhaddhaffis mubaraks mugabes el bashirs kibakis etc can not execute any african vision
3298649 in the absence of a culture that is sustaining hope both at home in school and post school the youths are creating their own brand and merchandising wholly hinged on destroying everything their pseudo society market sees as supreme the pressure to be achievers the incompetence of their political system the poverty in their society and the emergence of a quasi celebrity culture in this landscape has given birth to the emergence of the school as sub culture and it is a culture rooted in resistance burning and mayhem has become a badge of honor and no amount of colonial era subjugation tactics or traditional african nostalgia tidbits from the mouths of also rans is the remedy as mainstream kenya grapples with the tools of conspicuous consumption mis governance and modern day capitalistic mythologies of achievement so too has it to grapple with the price and consequences the alienation amongst its youth these are the kahluas we drink when we fail to provide vision and an inclusive culture to our youth and the necessities and security to life the obligations of every legitimate state we will not succeed by marketing state and patriarchal hegemony youth anywhere will always be amenable to brands because its a time of identity formation and brands sure do help when our national brand is impunity incompetence consumption and chest thumping our youths are simply buying in any student of the nineties in kenya would have known it would be the fire next time
3298650 mr zuma and the anc leaders who support him in his dark hour is therefore correct to insist that no one should assume that mr zuma is guilty of an offence merely because he was accused of wrongdoing by the npa they are correct also that he should not be treated as a criminal merely because he is an accused in a criminal trial however does this mean that we should be prohibited from making any value judgment about mr zumas character and his fitness for high public office until such time as he is either acquitted or convicted by a court i think not when we make value judgments about an individual especially individuals in the public sphere we are not required to establish beyond reasonable doubt that any allegations of wrongdoing by that person are true or not just as we are not required to establish beyond reasonable doubt whether an individual is a good or bad person a kind or nasty person a good or bad leader before we decide whether we want to befriend that person or elect him or her to high public office

3298667 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3298668 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3298669 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading

3298718 russia militarily and politically achieved what it wanted in all that time apart from some verbal criticism it has not met any sharp or fundamental reaction from the united states nor europe
3298719 the eu council of ministers is only meeting tomorrow and it was russias interest to put them in front of a final state of affairs which they seem to have achieved
3298720 it would be tactically disadvantageous for russia to continue in its actions during that meeting given that they had achieved what they wanted
3298721 the attacks on the territory of georgia and the military action outside the areas of conflict discredited russia and i cannot see how russia wants to defend the role of an arbiter a neutral player in those conflicts
3298722 eu ministers should agree on changing the negotiating formats for the conflicts in ossetia and abkhazia the role of russia can no longer be that of an arbiter of these conflicts
3298723 well see a bounce in stocks we saw the currency bounce back this morning
3298724 nonetheless investors will remain cautious for some time this is just yet another in a long line of events that have raised political risk levels in russia
3298725 last month we had putin making some fairly ominous warning sounds on oao metal a mining conglomerate and hinting at the fact that they may have some tax irregularities ominous overtones that are reminiscent of what happened with yukos
3298726 on the basis of your report i have taken the decision to bring to an end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3298727 our study suggests that patients long term outcome depends on an individuals expectancies patients who feel that the responsibility for the success of their treatment lies with them may make more gains than those who believe their therapist is responsible
3298728 this may be because once the regular support of the cbt group ends self regulation becomes essential if patients are to continue to make progress so people who take responsibility for their own progress are more likely to reach their goals over the long term
3298729 for cbt to be as effective as possible the importance of the role of the therapist should be minimized and patients should be encouraged to fully engage and feel a level of responsibility for the results of the therapy

3298738 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3298739 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3298740 the foreign nationals who were on georgian territory were able to cross the border due to a simplified procedure for obtaining visas
3298741 according to the department of missions of the armenian foreign ministry 66 french tourists crossed the armenian border
3298742 the embassy is ready to receive all french nationals who desire to come
3298743 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3298744 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3298745 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3298746 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3298747 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3298748 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3298749 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3298750 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3298751 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3298752 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3298753 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3298754 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3298755 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3298756 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3298757 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3298758 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3298759 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3298760 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3298761 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3298762 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3298763 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3298764 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3298765 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3298766 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3298767 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3298768 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3298769 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3298770 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3298771 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3298772 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3298773 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3298774 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3298775 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3298776 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3298777 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3298778 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3298779 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3298780 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3298781 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3298782 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3298783 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3298784 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3298785 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3298786 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3298787 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3298789 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3298790 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3298791 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3298792 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3298793 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3298794 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3298795 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3298796 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3298797 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3298798 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3298799 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3298800 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3298801 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3298802 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3298803 we would like to see that everyone who wants an elmo live will be able to get one
3298804 this pre order opportunity offers the best chance to those who order now that they will have elmo live on october 14th when it goes on sale in stores nationwide
3298805 elmo live delivers a rich play experience that is engaging and interactive its as close to being with elmo in the fur as any toy has ever been
3298806 we anticipate that this will be sold out very early in the season so taking advantage of this pre sale opportunity will be a key strategy for anyone who wants to score one of these toys
3298807 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3298808 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3298809 we have been copying from the copies for centuries but you make a good point my son
3298810 floyd ill make you lose your grip with this tiny piece of paper i can make you slip
3298811 with this study we looked at a very large population to determine how each individual could be stratified based on his or her dna
3298812 we want to see if the snps tied to a specific ancestry hold any biological significance to populations of different origins we want to see if the snps that we isolated are related to natural selection and adaptation for example to the weather conditions of different regions
3298813 because this method is purely computational and leverages linear algebraic methods such as principal components analysis without the use of information on self reported ancestry we were able to treat the data as a black box
3298814 much of the genetic variation was found to stretch between two points what we speculate is the northern european to southern european ancestry axis
3298815 alnylam has a long standing commitment to scientific excellence in the field of rnai therapeutics and our new collaboration with professor zerial and his team is representative of the collaborations we have and will continue to form as we seek to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanism of cellular delivery of rnai therapeutics
3298816 this agreement complements our existing delivery collaborations and will provide deep insights into the cellular uptake of sirnas and the pathways by which they function we believe the findings from this effort will allow us to further optimize and expand our broad range of delivery approaches for rnai therapeutics
3298817 i am very excited to be working with alnylam a leader in the field of rnai therapeutics to advance our understanding of how sirnas are taken up into the cell cytoplasm where they act to silence disease causing genes
3298818 through this collaboration we will increase our understanding of how different sirna formulations are internalized within cells and then use this knowledge to further optimize approaches for delivery of rnai therapeutics
3298819 a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so
3298820 it is crucial for service providers to understand the penetration of key enabling technologies in order to decide whether and when they should be scaling up the use of mdm in their businesses what is clear is that we are now at a critical point in terms of adoption of this key technology service providers looking to offer device management services based on oma dm should find they have a good choice of handsets across a range of price points
3298821 firmware updating is by no means the only application of oma dm that service providers are interested in oma dm is already being used for more sophisticated types of device configuration than oma cp is capable of such as continuous provisioning in conjunction with automatic detection it is handling client provisioning for new value added services being offered by operators and supporting important commercial functionality such as preferred roaming lists

3298824 of all the punishments they could have given him to make him go to jail
3298825 i mean probation until i get my ged would be reasonable but to send him to jail thats overboard
3298826 im about to be 19 and my dads being punished for something i did when i was 16
3298827 its like i should if anybody should be punished for this
3298828 i would way rather me go to jail than my dad
3298829 they probably should have punished me if they were going to punish anybody
3298830 because she did live with me at the time but because he had the custody thats why hes being punished
3298831 but i dont understand the punishment all together because shes going to school shes been going for four months
3298832 the only thing thats holding her back is she cant pass her math test

3298837 in londons civil appeal court lord justice ward attacked child access law after presiding over a case that saw a vicious mother falsely accuse her ex husband of sexually abusing their child
3298838 the father complains bitterly passionately and with every justification that the law is sterile impotent and utterly useless
3298839 decent fathers are left powerless to see their estranged children if vengeful mothers are determined to prevent access a senior judge has admitted
3298840 he spoke out after telling the father that there was nothing he could do to help him re establish contact with his daughter after his ex wife turned her against him
3298841 the mans 14 year old daughter who cannot been identified had been influenced by a drip drip drip of venom from his ex wife who wanted to deny him his paternal rights
3298842 in conferences and counseling theyre being wrapped in the fuzzy blankets of mens healing but behind these men and their stories are the same crackpot research coercive counseling and policy by anecdote that have defined the antiabortion movements tactical emphasis on womens suffering after abortion
3298843 technically reading a book and returning it is theft of knowledge
3298844 i dont advocate making a habit of buying new books reading them and returning them but once in a while i do think mass returns are a useful form of consumer protest
3298845 they took back my book with no problem got into a discussion with the cashier about how i was the 15th person to bring my book back today
3298846 o f those everyone loves to hate few can compete with the deadbeat dad for longevity how much do we hate him while were counting the ways fox tv may try to help america organize its contempt and put a face on this loathsome character
3298847 more to the point bad dads reinforces a stereotype that is neither accurate nor fair the rich pig who leaves his wife and kids for a pole dancing aerobics instructor or who enjoys extended martini lunches with his golf pals is far from the norm
3298848 the more accurate picture of a deadbeat dad is an unemployed or underemployed bloke who sees more jail cells than golf courses a common sequence of events for the poorest deadbeat dads goes something like this fall behind in child support get arrested and put in jail lose your job fall further behind in child support
3298849 for nearly two years james rhoades a university librarian in tallahassee has been fighting to establish in law what science and fact already have shown beyond any doubt he is the biological father of the boy dubbed j

3298851 but you must not forget it you become responsible forever for what you have tamed
3298852 while this is an incredibly important issue for children of divorce the shows producers seem to have missed substantive correlations between unemployment visitation interference and parental alienation all of which play an important factor in driving loving parents away from their children
3298853 the approach is disingenuous and in poor taste to begin with for seeking to humiliate minor children and their fathers at a time when u s census figures shows that non residential dads are more likely to pay child support than non custodial mothers
3298854 it is just as bad as promulgating a show about immigrants minorities or any other disenfranchised group
3298855 at a time when our nation is searching for answers to bring fathers back this approach will humiliate innocent children and further demonize fathers at the behest of left leaning feminist groups who seek to further marginalize their position
3298856 it glorifies divorce profiteering and the private collection companies that lure parents into signing collection contracts which retain 30 40 of child support payments it will insult and offend millions of fathers who pay their child support and struggle against the odds to be involved with their children
3298857 but you must not forget it you become responsible forever for what you have tamed

3299007 with her tremendous athletic ability and striking look we feel alison embodies the spirit and strength of lara croft
3299008 were excited to be working with her for the launch of tomb raider underworld and beyond and cant wait to see the reactions of tomb raider fans around the world to alisons uncannily realistic portrayal of lara
3299009 it took prodding from congress to persuade the cftc to finally request information from swap dealers about the participation of sovereign wealth funds in the commodity markets
3299010 the regulatory body in charge of policing our futures markets has been remarkably incurious about the role sovereign wealth funds play in commodity markets
3299011 those good hearted folks up there in new york who are running this wonderful speculated enterprise
3299012 now we find that these good hearted folks in the futures market have figured how to screw the farmers and the consumers in the city on a whole new product oil

3299018 we have been calling continually for greater transparency in the energy futures markets and anything short of full disclosure to the general public fails to meet the definition of transparency
3299019 we understand the need for cftc to process the data it is collecting but it is imperative to share that data with the american public with the utmost speed

3299025 apparently hundreds of thousands of gallons of spilled oil dead fish and oil covered birds arent ideal conditions for peddling a misguided plan for more offshore drilling
3299026 unfortunately the risk for such spills and far worse would only increase if john mccain and george bush get their way and allow big oil to begin the exploitation of our coasts
3299027 im sorry we were unable to go to an offshore oil rig because i think that drilling offshore is a vital step in addressing the price of oil and americas energy needs

3299048 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
3299049 given the need to protect against the possibility and the disruptive cost to the legal system of awards that are unpredictable and unnecessary either for deterrence or for measured retribution we consider that a 1 1 ratio is a fair upper limit in such maritime cases
3299050 in light of exxons decision to permit a lapsed alcoholic to command a supertanker carrying tens of millions of gallons of crude oil through the treacherous waters of prince william sound thereby endangering all of the individuals who depended upon the sound for their livelihoods the jury could reasonably have given expression to its moral condemnation of exxons conduct in the form of this award
3299051 we know this has been a very difficult time for everyone involved we have worked hard over many years to address the impacts of the spill and to prevent such accidents from happening in our company again
3299052 todays ruling adds insult to injury to the fishermen communities and alaska natives who have been waiting nearly 20 years for proper compensation following the worst environmental disaster in our nations history

3299056 americans will rightly ask how high gas prices have to rise before the democratic controlled congress will do something about it
3299057 president bush and john mccain are not serious about addressing gas prices
3299058 if they were they would stop offering the same old ideas meant to pad the pockets of big oil and work with democrats to reduce our dependence on oil
3299059 mccains capitulation to big oil could hurt him among independents and clinton supporters particularly in communities that depend on a clean ocean and beaches for their jobs and small businesses
3299060 bushs announcement of support today makes it clearer that senator mccain is running for bushs third term
3299061 when drivers are paying 4 for a gallon of gas and theres the perception that the economys going to hell in a handbasket voter attitudes regarding offshore drilling can change pretty quickly
3299062 they should decrease the budget deficit limit spending money and refrain from using oil revenues
3299063 given the government lots of self confidence in many fields
3299064 when you have plenty of money you can solve many problems
3299065 if the price suddenly would drop they will not be able to provide the country with necessary imports the oil money is this governments lifeline
3299066 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel

3299073 our modus operandi for this record was to use more horns
3299074 and also to write songs on synthesizers and then turn them into guitar based songs but the main thing was to get all these songs out of our heads and onto paper they were in our heads now they are on paper
3299075 we have been talking for years about our next single being called gay bar part 2 or naming our next album gay bar pt 2
3299076 we started by floating it out in interviews for a laugh the interviewers always ended up believing us and getting really excited about the prospect of a gay bar pt 2 at first we felt sorry for them later we felt sorry for us because we began to see that we had less money now we want more money this is the only way

3299079 i associate flashy with lasers sodomy and sequins this album is pretty much the opposite of that that is to say it is blunt spears anal celibacy and denim however however i have learned this one thing i have learned that in the media you can say anything as long as you say something in the media it becomes true the media is the great legitimizer it doesnt matter that this record is not really flashy it just matters that i say it is why is this record flashy because this guy is saying it is in the media

3299086 beh a dire il vero il tuo cuore molto meno bello del mio
3299087 confronta il tuo cuore col mio il mio perfetto mentre il tuo un rattoppo di ferite e lacrime
3299088 il tuo ha un aspetto assolutamente perfetto ma non farei mai cambio col mio vedi ciascuna ferita rappresenta una persona alla quale ho donato il mio amore ho staccato un pezzo del mio cuore e glielho dato e spesso ho ricevuto in cambio un pezzo del loro cuore a colmare il vuoto lasciato nel mio cuore ma certo ci che dai non mai esattamente uguale a ci che ricevi e cos ho qualche bitorzolo a ci per sono affezionato ciascuno mi ricorda lamore che ho condiviso altre volte invece ho dato via pezzi del mio cuore a persone che non mi hanno corrisposto questo ti spiega le voragini amare rischioso certo ma per quanto dolorose siano queste voragini che rimangono aperte nel mio cuore mi ricordano sempre lamore che ho provato anche per queste persone e chiss forse un giorno ritorneranno e magari colmeranno lo spazio che ho riservato per loro comprendi adesso che cosa sia il vero amore

3299092 since he has participated in four games a bronze medal is an historical breakthrough for him
3299093 i am confident of bringing back two gold medals at the games
3299094 i will work hard on every dive instead of caring too much about results
3299095 just as we start to recover we face another crisis of potentially even greater dimension
3299096 it shows the way in which the industry can rapidly turn from profit to loss if you look at some of the other forecasts of oil at 200 a barrel then i think its more likely to be worse than iatas projections
3299097 i really dont think that anything washington does is going to significantly affect chinas domestic energy policies
3299098 china will choose to subsidize or not subsidize fuels because of how it sees chinas own economic and energy interests
3299099 the currency is certainly an important issue but its not just about the currency this time
3299100 the united states and china dont always agree on economic issues
3299101 sometimes we may disagree quite strongly but we keep talking
3299102 when conflicts or problems arise we need to solve them through dialogue and communication and improve mutual understanding to avoid complicating and politicizing economic and trade issues
3299103 weve been asking them to adopt our policies in terms of exchange rates financial deregulation and everything else to follow our model rather than selectively deciding what fits our mutual interests and pursuing that
3299104 this mentality that believes that the core of the world is that one committee dines and makes a report for anther committee which in turn dines
3299105 shows a lack of understanding of the insights of joseph schumpeter
3299106 we sold almost all of our energy shares in spring 2006 and bought them all back six months later our theme hadnt changed but sometimes stocks just go nuts
3299107 we rode merck all the way up and rode it back down
3299108 our industry cannot sustain paying a 25 percent tax while the government enjoy the windfall and put it in their back pocket
3299109 we believe that this strike is unnecessary and we would want to ensure that nothing was done that inconvenienced the public
3299110 but the most responsible thing the public can do is to continue to buy as normal
3299111 this is a question of conscience this is a company that has to have a socialist focus
3299112 he said i have good news theyre selling a company
3299113 i reviewed the characteristics of the company and i said lets not waste a day
3299114 on the international level only 3 percent of the more than 40 percent increase we have seen in world food prices this year is due to the increased demand on corn for ethanol
3299115 successful small business owners come from all walks of life
3299116 but as different as small business owners can be they usually exhibit a few fundamental traits that are common among all successful business owners
3299117 thats what happens when a guy only wants to get laid
3299118 eine bestimmte anzahl von schwarzkopierten dvds die im ausland produziert wurde ist auf den chinesischen markt gekommen
3299119 yeah we must be there and be a part of that
3299120 my thinking is way more radical than it used to be but im afraid that the next steps would involve getting weapons
3299121 nous avons tous la responsabilit de sauver notre pays du stade actuel
3299122 theyll get sort of addicted and then well somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade
3299123 its easier for our software to compete with linux when theres piracy than when theres not
3299124 nobody knows nobody nobody knows how i loved the man as i was tearing off his clothes
3299125 nobody nobody knows my pain when i see that its risen that full moon again
3299126 hey look at me im on the interwebs im kinda trendy and good at pretending that i know how to use a computer watch as i post blurry and dark webcam pictures of myself that are taken as i hold the camera up to a mirror or above my head in a vain attempt to express emotion ive never heard of gamma correction or color balance before see my eyes the bigger my eyes are in my pictures the more moody and vulnerable i am as a person
3299127 are rx able and are capable of being cold fitted with a prescription lens up to 8 diopters
3299128 there aint nothin in chicago for a monkey woman to do
3299129 scandals whether in politics academia or other areas can be useful they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could

3299138 i said we want to take some of your blood
3299139 sigh we live in slightly more enlightened times these days mr ayres it is exactly the same process as giving blood only its done deliberately to make sure your body releases some of the excess iron it has stored in your body leeches might do the job but they are a bit of a plitter a syringe is much simpler

3299160 it would be utterly unacceptable for russia to try and destabilise a democratically elected government on its border with a view to any sort of regime change
3299161 the international community would view that extraordinarily dimly and would have diplomatic consequences for russia
3299162 an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces
3299163 there is a clear responsibility on the russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end
3299164 the only language that bullies understand is when someone stands up to them
3299165 what russia has done here is used massive and disproportionate force its breached international law and it has violated georgias territorial integrity
3299166 it has acted as a massive and dangerous bully and we cant allow this to go ahead without it being challenged
3299167 there is only one solution an international solution we need to do this together

3299175 body weight maintenance is made up of three basic stages
3299176 in the first stage the brain receives sensory input from the body including information provided by circulating hormones such as leptin and ghrelin and from fuels such as glucose and fatty acids
3299177 it is well known that agrp agouti related protein neurons play a critical role in feeding and energy balance regulation
3299178 however the deletion of agrp and npy two neuropeptides released from the agrp neurons produces little metabolic effect
3299179 the mice with agrp neuron specific disruption of gaba release were lean had higher energy expenditure and showed resistance to diet induced obesity
3299180 we also found that these animals showed reduced food intake response to the hormone ghrelin this suggests to us that the neurocircuit engaging gaba release from the agrp neurons mediates at least part of ghrelins appetite stimulating action
3299181 as these new findings demonstrate gaba release is an important component that mediates the function of agrp neurons
3299182 discoveries such as this will ultimately help us to design an efficient strategy to tackle the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease
3299183 der austausch zwischen spezialisten von disney und eth forschern unter einem gemeinsamen dach wird der kreativit t auf beiden seiten in hohem masse f rderlich sein
3299184 wir wollen beispielsweise neue algorithmen entwickeln um sowohl traditionelle animationstechniken als auch die 3 d computer animation auf eine neue stufe der perfektion zu heben

3299186 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
3299187 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
3299188 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
3299189 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
3299190 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
3299191 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
3299192 the leaders met again tuesday but could not arrive at a workable formula or solution that would appease the people
3299193 the leaders will report to the prime minister of their deliberations and maybe some announcement will be made

3299195 creating the next generation of sophisticated technologies requires long term vision and collaboration with world class innovators
3299196 joint ph d projects and research contracts as well as teaching services from senior disney researchers will arise from the partnership in addition to the joint intellectual properties and patents that will result from our research
3299197 a unique opportunity with enormous potential for all participating parties to be chosen as the european loca tion for disney research is further proof of eth zurichs excellent international reputation and the quality of our research and development in this case in information technology and visual computing

3299200 to be honest the pollution has not been a problem
3299201 if any of the athletes are going to suffer its going to be the marathon runners
3299202 they were giving him points for everything yet when i was hitting him they werent giving me anything
3299203 but ive been watching the scoring here for the last four days and thought it was bad so i cant say im surprised before the fight we were told wed be given a warning if we ran round the ring yet he spent the whole of that last round running
3299204 the only way i could win it was by not letting him hit me in the end i just had to go for a knockout and thats what i was trying to do he beat me on a bad decision here in china last year but i beat him in the worlds when it mattered
3299205 now let him come and fight me in my own backyard and well find out whos the true winner
3299206 you expect a level playing field at the olympics and we didnt get that here
3299207 joe didnt box particularly well but the scoring dictates what tactics you use and the other guy was given more points than he deserved those scores were stupid and they changed our tactics

3299211 i recently had the opportunity to speak with adam sorbo a 23 year old chipolte employee who had the pleasure of serving cleveland browns quarterback brady quinn this past tuesday adam was kind enough to answer a few questions and talk us through his brady quinn chipolte experience
3299212 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
3299213 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
3299214 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
3299215 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
3299216 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
3299217 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
3299218 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

3299221 tablighi jamaat pledged an open day event during the summer at which we would view the work see an exhibition and meet their architects and consultants
3299222 it is now almost the end of summer with the islamic fasting month of ramadan just two weeks away yet there is still no sign of the event
3299223 in march they indicated to local residents and media their serious intent to press ahead with their mosque but refused to answer questions or give details
3299224 so five months later worried locals are left with the threat of this huge mosque hanging over their heads yet still are given no information
3299225 tablighi jamaat is a secretive global missionary sect from south asia that wants to build its international headquarters mosque here in london

3299243 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3299244 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3299245 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3299246 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3299247 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3299248 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars

3299275 the only way this can end is with the withdrawal of georgian forces so that they are not in south ossetia
3299276 the georgians must agree to sign agreements on the non use of force with the ossetians and with the abkhazians
3299277 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3299278 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3299279 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3299280 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3299281 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3299282 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3299283 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3299284 the line was so long i was like what is this
3299285 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3299286 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3299287 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3299288 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3299289 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away

3299302 we geloven niet dat de wet veilingbedrijven als ebay toestaat om dit probleem te negeren terwijl het winsten blijft maken aan het aanbieden en verhandelen van nepartikelen het merkenrecht staat niet toe dat tiffany verplicht wordt om te patrouilleren op de ebay site ebay heeft de site ontworpen is is daarom verantwoordelijk om te patrouilleren op vervalsingen
3299303 dat komt omdat mensen zich vervelen het bieden van voorzieningen en het aantrekkelijker maken van stations moet hierbij helpen
3299304 onze reizigers zitten gemiddeld 38 minuten in de trein en ze verblijven gemiddeld 5 minuten op het perron
3299305 als die 5 minuten 15 minuten lijken dan heeft dat misschien invloed bij de keuze voor de auto of de trein het gaat daarbij toch vaak om snelheid en gemak
3299306 ook storende factoren als bijvoorbeeld het weer wilden we gelijk houden
3299307 daar hebben we wel aan gewerkt maar het is een duivels dilemma met een licht programma wordt de groep die mee kan doen aan het onderzoek groter als je het te realistisch maakt dan is het programma weer te zwaar voor veel mensen
3299308 daarnaast kan je je ook afvragen of het kwaliteitsniveau heel veel uitmaakt hoe levensecht moet zon omgeving zijn
3299309 we kijken of we de verwachte effecten vinden en hoe die precies uitpakken met hele duidelijke resultaten kan het zijn dat we in leiden een perron aan gaan passen om het in een echte situatie te gaan meten
3299310 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3299311 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3299312 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3299313 uc san diego medical center is a baby friendly hospital which means we encourage breastfeeding as the preferred method of infant nutrition for our newborns
3299314 we are now applying this same model of care to our smallest most vulnerable infants the goal is a better understanding of human milk to achieve healthier preemies who are breastfeeding when they leave our hospital
3299315 the baby is in a doubly difficult situation of dealing with life outside the womb while having a highly immature gastrointestinal system this can lead to major bowel dysfunction or failure while this is a critical time to care for infant this is also a pivotal time to help mom make breastfeeding a priority for the long term health of their child
3299316 while premature infants may not be capable of breastfeeding in the short term we are identifying strategies and techniques to provide the infants the milk and to make the milk available in the long run the data collected from this study will be shared globally with hospitals that would like to adopt similar programs for premature infants
3299317 human breast milk is considered human tissue and is full of carbohydrates lipids vitamins and minerals there are approximately 300 components to breast milk including small biologically active compounds that aid in the formation of the gastrointestinal tract
3299318 the contents vary dramatically from mother to mother and feeding to feeding depending on the babys needs
3299319 we plan to look for correlations between the mothers diet and the nutritional characteristics of the breast milk we may be able to identify certain foods and supplements that aid in the infants growth and development
3299320 fortunately breast milk contains enzymes that help protect against nec
3299321 babies born at one pound have their intestinal development in place but all things attributed to function are either at the earliest phase or have not kicked in at all breast milk has growth factors that affect the ability of the gut to grow and can get the digestion process on track to prevent this dangerous infection
3299322 every second counts for the growth rate of infants especially in the first days when babies are gaining up to 20 grams per kilogram of weight per day
3299323 the brain increases 5 in size every 48 to 72 hours adequate and extra nutrients can improve brain growth which is something the spin program is measuring
3299324 human milk provides benefits that are both nutritional and neurological
3299325 in our life time we will not be able to replicate its biological complexities until that day the best thing for all newborns is breast milk the spin program will help us learn how and why for preemies
3299326 the mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven
3299327 al momento no ci sono le condizioni per cui io possa apparire nella serie
3299328 sure i know i should eat veggies but i dont have time to cook theres too much else to do
3299329 yeah i feel guilty about eating those danish pastries but i was running late this morning and didnt have time for breakfast
3299330 what i cant talk now im late for a meeting dont you have some work to do
3299331 what are they going to chew the food for me as well
3299332 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3299333 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3299334 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3299335 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
3299336 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3299337 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3299338 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3299339 its important for people to understand whats infecting and killing these frogs
3299340 this disease is a remarkable example of a pathogen jumping boundaries and causing havoc if we can understand how it is able to do so we may be able to help the frogs as well as ourselves
3299341 refractive error is therefore the most common condition affecting the ocular health of the u s population involving young adults middle aged persons and older adults of all ethnicities
3299342 accurate current estimates of the prevalence of refractive error are essential for projecting vision care needs and planning for provision of vision care services to the many people affected
3299343 we hope it will impact how cities look at their trees
3299344 obviously a lot of cities havent yet stepped back and said why do we do this the way we do it
3299345 we need to look at ordinances across multiple states and see if there are common features we havent done that
3299346 without a current inventory you cant write a street tree management plan

3299354 so the child finally decides to grace us with her presence
3299355 i already know what a disappointment youve been to your father dont make the mistake of doing the same with me stand before your elders you truculent little bitch
3299356 you speak to an adult only when you are given permission to do so you obey any and all instructions given to you by an adult instantly and without question you adhere strictly to the timetables and strictures given to you again without question you eat when we tell you you sleep when we tell you you learn when we tell you within this structure you will learn obedience and eventually become rehabilitated to your home and your parents do you understand
3299357 good you were unaware of the restrictions placed on you when you entered this establishment which is why you got off as lightly as you did if you disobey me again you will find me considerably less lenient do you understand
3299358 youve already met mccaffrey our groundsman hes doubtless tried to ingratiate himself with you
3299359 dont be fooled by him mccaffreys responsibilities include the security of our perimeter he views any potential escapee from the school in a very dim light
3299360 she docks my pay if i let any of you brats oot nothin personal hen but no schoolgirl stands between me and my paycheck
3299361 there is nowhere for you to go the nearest village is pitlochery back along the path youve just come from ten miles on a very bad road were surrounded on three sides by gorse land and swamp and on the other were facing well
3299362 this school is situated on cape wrath as nor westerly as it gets
3299363 theres an escape route for you child you have two choices iceland or america you may need a swimming costume
3299364 now its late you chose a most inconvenient time to arrive the rest of the school is asleep and i see no reason to disturb your classmates unnecessarily you will sleep here tonight and i will introduce you to the school at morning assembly
3299365 itll be the last night in a while that you enjoy such luxury
3299366 well if thats everything i understand the train back to inverness arrives at dawn i can sleep at the station until then im sure wed all like to get some sleep its been a long day
3299367 youre sure you wont stay here mccaffrey could put you up at the lodge
3299368 i couldnt intrude although id beg mister mccaffreys indulgence if he could give me a lift back to pitlochery
3299369 i love driving a dirt track at night maybe itll rain just tae add spice
3299370 child do you have anything you wish to say before your father leaves
3299371 good evening nell you will call me by my married name i am sister serenity
3299372 your first day at school will be draining i can promise you that
3299373 welcome to your new home welcome to st annes school for wayward girls
3299374 forgive me i made you like this i brought this on you
3299375 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3299376 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3299377 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3299378 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3299379 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3299380 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3299381 it seems like the people who say this are convinced that such kerfuffles only and could only happen amongst women but i have to say believing that mostly means one has internalized the sexist messaging that terms disagreements between women as catfights but between men as vigorous debate
3299382 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3299383 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3299384 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3299385 i dont think my daughter knew what she was getting into
3299386 the babys father was in jail she was going through a long time
3299387 had a problem with baby javon who would not comply with mealtime ritual by saying amen after meals
3299388 the more the queen pressed javon the more resistant he became
3299389 the queen told everyone that god was going to raise javon from the dead
3299390 the queen was able to gain the confidence of morgan who allowed the group to stay at his residence approximately one week
3299391 consistent on time delivery of snomed ct releases is critical to ihtsdo member nations and other users who rely on the terminology in their electronic health record applications
3299392 ultimately the quality of patient care will be improved by the use of a standardized terminology and electronic health records

3299394 dresser amp two night stands all wood not pressed wood this is real wood amp in good condition
3299395 at first i was kind of scared i like it i was just worried about the security but i think its going to be a good thing
3299396 we are working to create a system where these laptops become paper weights if stolen
3299397 no content filter is perfect we adjust as much as we can
3299398 lisa if you can hear us say so and well give you 5
3299399 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3299400 if i was independently wealthy and i didnt need an income i would do this for nothing thats how much i love it
3299401 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3299402 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3299403 this isnt just a career for me its my passion

3299406 would it be convenient for me to pop round right now
3299407 if theres one thing id like people to remember its that were a real band
3299408 basically fundamentally television was a performers medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow
3299409 one of the reasons that i honestly believe that the care taken on light entertainment had to be the same care as was taken for ballet or opera or serious drama is because you are contributing to the culture of the country i think its sad if it isnt
3299410 its a very sad day to lose him he knew about the business he knew about television
3299411 he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3299412 he knew how to treat performers he knew how to talk to them how to get them to do things even if they didnt want to he talked them into it because he knew it would be good for them
3299413 without him i dont think the show would have gone on he undoubtedly had a nose for a hit
3299414 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt
3299415 he was an entrepreneur and theres not many of his type about any more im afraid we shall miss him terribly i loved him
3299416 he was both a great impresario and also a passionate believer in public service broadcasting
3299417 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3299418 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other disorders we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3299419 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3299420 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3299421 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3299422 kids tell us they rely on their friends to keep them safe some call them their best allies and protectors
3299423 we believe it is all about education and awareness once people understand food allergies it is easy to keep brianna and other children safe
3299424 we take the time to educate those who are around brianna
3299425 this includes the children in her classroom and their parents the entire staff in her school and the education community within our county we have found that most people know someone who has food allergies and want to learn as much as they can to keep that person safe
3299426 to help julia manage her food allergies i do simple things like at lunch remind people who dont sit with us very often that julia cant have some of the foods they eat if julia gets something on her she cant have i take her to the bathroom and make sure she uses extra soap
3299427 every time somebody brings in treats for their birthday at school angela is always making sure im ok
3299428 when angela has her own parties she always makes sure i can have all the treats including the cake
3299429 to me its important to be a pal because i know that every day i act as a pal im making julias life safer who wouldnt want to do that for a friend like julia
3299430 it is a key initiative for us to not only provide highly accurate diagnostic information to clinicians but also take the next step and offer additional information to assist in their treatment and management decisions
3299431 with our ability to perform the target gi analysis on the biopsies that we receive for initial cancer diagnosis each week the paths of anatomic pathology and molecular testing are now united in a highly efficient manner we can offer critical additional information to physicians and their patients before beginning a course of treatment that includes relevant chemotherapy
3299432 practicing preventive measures to reduce the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes is the best way to prevent humans from contracting the virus
3299433 after three years its unbelievable that everything is taking so long to get moving
3299434 for people who want to come home rent is more expensive utilities are more expensive everythings more expensive nobodys doing anything to get people home a lot of people are in bad health because of stress
3299435 the problem is that too many people have their hand in the cookie jar
3299436 a lot of people are thinking too much about themselves and not looking at the bigger picture that goes for city government all the way up to the federal government politicians will promise you the world but when it comes down to it its politics as usual
3299437 its done theyre just not releasing it he says its just on hold eventually it will come out
3299438 in order to prevent boroughs like ealing from becoming the hot spots of the future we have to take both an immediate response and a longer term approach in terms of those boroughs which are emerging later in terms of gang activity
3299439 we know from young people involved that there are many who say they want to exit gangs but they dont know how
3299440 there are boroughs which offer gang exit strategies and we need to be able to share their experiences of what works
3299441 people like to feel affinity with others whether its based upon a particular postcode a particular estate or ethnicity
3299442 a top priority must be to tackle deprivation and alienation and ensure that all communities feel that they have a stake in ealing community cohesion isnt something we can ever take for granted
3299443 since may weve already announced several new measures including an additional 440 police officers to double the number of safer transport teams in the capital as well as launching operation blunt 2 to get knives and other weapons off our streets
3299444 however in the longer term we understand that diverting young people in ealing away from gangs and anti social behaviour will take more than police action
3299445 your councils average response time to enquiries is 36 2 days an increase for the second year
3299446 this is a matter of concern the only service areas to respond to our enquiries within 28 days were benefits and transports and highways average response times from all other service areas exceeded 28 days then failed to provide the information requested necessitating further inquiries by my investigator
3299447 the council constantly reviews the way it provides its services in order to make improvements for residents we are pleased that this has been reflected with an overall reduction in the number of complaints received for the second year running
3299448 has all the qualities needed to assist us in next seasons campaign
3299449 public perception is that bank ruptcy affects the poor but this is generally not the case with most of our clients from middle income britain
3299450 i think the upward trend will continue and part of the reason is because of the economic run up until the last six months which saw large increases in spending
3299451 what we are currently seeing is a retraction from spending and a recessionary downturn and many entrepreneurs are struggling as cash is not being spent
3299452 we work on the debtors side and provide emotional and financial support for our clients
3299453 were being inundated with requests for help but what has been more striking than the number of people falling into debt is how much they own
3299454 perhaps 10 years ago it was unusual for a client to have a debt of over 10 000 but now people are in debt mostly to the tune of 50 000 on credit cards and bank loans
3299455 lenders have to be held to account in some degree their perception of their service has changed from lending to people who need it to just profit making from them
3299456 these figures bring more worrying evidence that our economy is built on debt
3299457 behind every insolvency there is a personal tragedy and taken together they add to a growing social problem
3299458 but when it comes to me and my job my football club and my team im very particular that we get it right and if people stand in my way theyre not going to be around for too long
3299459 its either them going or me and i dont want to go anywhere
3299460 you have to distance yourself at times but youve also got to have that personal side so that they can come to you if theyve got a problem
3299461 i like to think im open with the players but if they overstep the mark it wont be accepted the players whove left the club will testify to that if you cross me i can be a nasty so and so
3299462 you can sit and mope around and let it affect the rest of your life or you get on with it and realise there are opportunities to be successful in something else
3299463 i loved playing but i love managing now its a great job and i want to give everything ive got to be successful
3299464 i had a reasonably successful playing career and i want to be an even more successful manager
3299465 its a job that so far ive really enjoyed i feel it was something i was made to do
3299466 im confident in everything i do ill back myself in any situation i know what im doing and im confident of the people ive got around me
3299467 i think the turning point in terms of me getting the job was the 3 0 home win against chester last december
3299468 they were a side at the top and we completely dominated we looked attractive going forward and stronger as a team and thats when i realised they had grasped everything i was trying to put across to them
3299469 it proved to me the players and the board that i was the right man for the job and hopefully that hasnt changed
3299470 ive made a lot of changes at the club in playing staff and management and i feel they are the right ones to take us forward
3299471 i want players that want to play here and there are no players here now that i dont want at the club
3299472 im delighted with the squad weve put together and wont jeopardise that by just jumping in and getting a player whos not right
3299473 and if they dont jump on board with the ideas we are putting across they wont be here long either we also know whats going on with the boys when theyre not at work and we find out a lot of things but fortunately the lads are good and dont take liberties they do look after themselves
3299474 we are always looking to improve things whether its our training the way we eat the way we travel or the way we prepare for games and were looking to see if we can tweak things all through the season we want to improve on a daily basis
3299475 i want to run it like a premiership club albeit with league two finances
3299476 i want to get promoted out of this league and ill be disappointed if we dont go up but i dont think it will be a failure given where we were last year
3299477 we need to improve and be up there challenging for a play off spot as long as we make progress and set a platform we can build on ill be happy
3299478 it might take a year given all the changes weve made its going to be a team effort and there will be times when its a question of digging in working very hard and putting bodies on the line
3299479 the only thing that can be done to avoid any further trouble is a dispersal order
3299480 it is regret table that this action has to be taken but if police believe it is necessary to protect the community as a whole in southall then they should carry out such a measure
3299481 i understand that some people perceive there is tension within the sikh community but i would not make too much out of it very rarely do the police take this sort of action and we have 9 300 members within the gurdwara who are peaceful and law abiding at all times
3299482 we have introduced the dispersal order in direct response to intelligence gathered and community concern surrounding potential anti social or dis orderly behaviour taking place in the lead up to the october elections
3299483 this type of behaviour is unacceptable and we will use the order along with a visible police presence in the area to deter such behaviour prevent crime and if necessary deal swiftly with offenders
3299484 kalau pada dasarnya yang kita hubungi dalam hal ini yang berhubungan dengan kita adalah perusahaannya bukan 1 atau 2 perorangan dalam hal ini kalau ada pengusaha yang tidak aktif jadi sudah tidak relevan tapi perusahaannya yang relevan
3299485 jadi kita akan kembali ke kontrak karena memang selama ini pemerintah selalu menghormati kontrak kalau ada hal hal yang selama ini dianggap tidak konsisten atau tidak jelas atau kalau ada perubahan undang undang terutama pada sisi pajaknya kita selesaikan di situ
3299486 persoalannya adalah dari pajak penjualan menjadi pajak pertambahan nilai dan menjadi barang tidak kena pajak itu persoalan yang akan kita selesaikan mekanismenya menteri esdm dan dirjen pajak akan melihat bagaimana melakukan klasifikasi dari batubara yang sesuai dengan kontrak kalau kemudian mereka mendapatkan pajak masukan dari

3299491 the number of primary care physicians who are diagnosing and treating bipolar patients has been on the rise in the past few years but surveyed primary care physicians follow a very different treatment pattern than surveyed psychiatrists
3299492 nearly half of the patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors first line receive these drugs as a monotherapy despite guideline recommendations to give bipolar patients presenting with depression an antimanic first line
3299493 the continuum wireless is designed to produce efficiency and boost throughput in mri but it also builds confidence in the patient care staff that control of a patients medication is always nearby especially when implemented for applications like pediatric sedation
3299494 the initiation of this validation study is an integral part of the commercialization roadmap for our diagnostic tests as we advance them towards use in a clinical setting
3299495 we believe the initiation of this study for our cup assay with a leading cancer research center such as m d anderson attests to the critical unmet need this test addresses
3299496 the current gold standard diagnostic evaluation for cup consists of a careful history and physical examination laboratory tests imaging studies invasive studies when necessary and thorough pathologic evaluation this process is lengthy and exposes the patient to unnecessary toxicities
3299497 rosetta genomics microrna based cup assay may present an alternative test to current diagnostic practices this study aims to validate their assay as well as compare its performance with current tests for cup
3299498 this ground breaking discovery confirms what researchers and experts have believed for some time mitochondrial disease is not rare
3299499 we now know that 1 in 200 people carry the mutation for this horrible debilitating disease this discovery underscores the need for additional research funding to help better diagnose and treat affected individuals and to learn more about how mitochondrial dysfunction is connected to other diseases
3299500 the demonstration by dr chinnery and colleagues that at least one in 200 newborns harbor known pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3299501 this new observation augments the rapidly expanding body of evidence indicating that common mitochondrial dna lineages modulate the risk for developing a wide variety of diseases including diabetes cardiovascular disease parkinson disease alzheimer disease various cancers as well as longevity
3299502 dr chinnerys research raises many new questions none of which can be answered without additional dollars allocated for research into mitochondrial disease and dysfunction
3299503 this line of research holds great promise ultimately the investment we make may enable doctors and researchers to transform medicine benefiting not only those suffering from mitochondrial disease but the many millions of americans who suffer from the wide range of diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction
3299504 i told my agent i dont want to go up north or play for any other team in this league and if you can make that possible ill give you a big kiss
3299505 i was getting the vibes from the management that i wasnt in their plans and i was telling my agent that if things dont happen down here theres only one place i want to go thats what he did and its happened
3299506 the whole year at fulham i dont think i was even on the training pitch it was pretty much a write off season down there
3299507 i was still two months away from playing when lawrie sanchez was given the sack and when roy hodgson came in he signed seven or eight players so it was always going to be difficult for the players signed by sanchez to get into the team
3299508 i was disappointed i didnt get a chance to show what i can do at fulham but the ultimate dream has always been to play here at qpr in the premier league
3299509 it was always going to be difficult for me going back after charlton to break into the fulham team no matter how well id done in pre season and i was training well and playing well i couldnt do any more really
3299510 it was a case of hes got his players down there and i wasnt going to be given a chance
3299511 now i want to consistently perform like the season i was here before i left youve got to be consistent home and away because its such a tough division
3299512 if i can put the performances in and the gaffers happy with me thats all i can do and if my other team mates can do it too well be up there
3299513 when i came here with charlton the reception i got when i came off left my grandad and dad up in the stands with a tear in their eye
3299514 it was so emotional with 17 or 18 thousand chanting my name it was mad
3299515 ive got a special relationship with the fans and im hoping to entertain them this year
3299516 im so happy to be back down here and its exciting times ive come here on loan with a view to a permanent move and in my eyes im here for the next three years
3299517 youve got to believe you will play in the premier league or its not going to happen before i used to think it but now its closer to that dream with these owners the club deserves another crack at the big time and hopefully im part of that
3299518 this seizure demonstrates our continuing commitment to protect public health the type of medicines we seized may not have been assessed for safety quality and efficacy at best these medicines could be a waste of money at worst they could be severely detrimental to your health
3299519 in a few years theyre going to have one of the better stops on tour with what theyve got for a course
3299520 its a little different golf course than what were used to seeing because for me you really only need driver for nos 14 and 15 and 18
3299521 i cant see any hole on the front where i need it its not going to be about distance this week whoever wins here is going to have to be very creative around the greens
3299522 a lot of old courses are modified where they take out the mowing patterns and let the bunkers grow over through the years but this this is something different
3299523 its like i took a step back in time and im seeing what donald ross saw all those years back
3299524 were really counting on the word getting out about this place
3299525 theres just so much going for us here and it starts with the course
3299526 the rough certainly wont be as bad here but the greens are going to be nice and fast
3299527 you have to come in to them at the right angle or theres going to be trouble
3299528 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3299529 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3299530 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3299531 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3299532 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3299533 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3299534 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3299535 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing

3299611 the privatization of medicare is saddling older and disabled people with rising premiums and growing out of pocket costs at a time when they are already feeling the pain of an economic downturn
3299612 we must reverse wasteful privatization in favor of real solutions to preserve medicare our one universal healthcare plan
3299613 medicare beneficiaries and all taxpayers are paying more than they should in order to provide robust subsidies to private medicare plans

3299622 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3299623 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually
3299624 we are trying our best but we really think they have all died their bodies might be buried below the rubble and they could even have been swept away down the red river
3299625 by measuring the dependable levels of mpa we identified that patients with less than 30mg h l were more likely to reject their organ in the first month after transplantation and this trend was even more pronounced in at risk patients

3299695 saya mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda bacalah al qur an karena di hari kiamat kelak ia akan memberikan syafaat bagi pembacanya bacalah zahrawaen yaitu surah al baqarah dan surah ali imran sesungguhnya pada hari kiamat nanti keduanya akan datang bagaikan dua awan atau dua kawanan burung yang berbaris yang siap membantu orang orang yang pernah membacanya dan bacalah surah al baqarah karena membacanya adalah suatu berkat dan meninggalkannya adalah suatu kerugian tukang sihir tak akan sanggup menghasutnya

3299705 dia merayakan peringatan maulid nabi di bulan robiul awal dengan amat mewah

3299709 salah satu contoh perbuatan meniru orang nashrani adalah perayaan maulid nabi
3299710 nabi shalallahualaihi wasallam adalah nur fauqo nur cahaya diatas cahaya
3299711 amma badu banyak muncul pertanyaan dari saudara saudara kami tentang perkumpulan yang biasa diamalkan sebagian manusia pada bulan rabiul awal yang mereka namakan dengan maulid
3299712 lihat iqtidho shirotil mustaqim 2 123 124 tahqiq dr nasir abdul karim al aql

3299772 might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3299773 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house inc booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the book
3299774 frankly im more afraid of global warming than of terrorist attacks
3299775 i did expect my book would be controversial just because im a pink woman writing about a culture that was not my own and a religion that is not my own but my aim was not to provoke it was to portray the difficulty of being a woman in that era and to portray this wonderful heroine who overcame obstacles to become a prominent figure in islam

3299833 and he beat me in a bad decision here before now hes beaten me here again this time they were giving him points for everything and making me work for every shot i was hitting clean and they still werent giving me shots they let him have it his own way
3299834 i thought they were very generous to the chinese lad
3299835 you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and you also expect a level playing field
3299836 he is strong and i think hes better than me
3299837 he had to pick one or the other he picked the chinese kid but because it was in his own backyard he took two points off me as well
3299838 i got caught off balance and he hit my arm and he got the point
3299839 ive watched the scoring the first few days and i knew what would happen we were told before we went in the ring that if we ran around wed get a warning but i never heard the referee tell him about it once
3299840 the weight was as a big fight for me on its own i was struggling for the worlds and nine months is a long time to make weight i want to let him come and fight me in my own backyard at the 2012 olympics and well see who the true man is then
3299841 joe didnt box the best ive seen him but scoring makes a difference in the tactics youve got a game plan when you go in if that changes you have to box differently and i think joe had a game plan that was working the scoring was absolutely stupid and that changed it
3299842 joes a very talented lad and did very well in the world championships but that was on a level playing field here every time he landed they pressed the button for the chinese lad
3299843 im not grouching at all but you saw for yourself yesterday the ukraine team lodged a protest against the chinese scoring and im not going to do that its sour grapes

3299850 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3299851 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3299852 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3299853 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3299854 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3299855 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3299856 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3299857 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3299858 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3299859 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3299860 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things

3299884 i accept shabana had come from a totally different culture and there may well have been a natural reluctance to discuss these problems
3299885 she may not have realised she was depressed and i think it was a spontaneous and impulsive reaction to pressures around her
3299886 i think she resorted to what would be to her previous culture something that was done if anything it was a cry for help because she had no other way of expressing herself
3299887 i dont think she had any understanding of the danger of using accelerants and fire
3299888 i made this decision not because i was concerned by her background muslim faith but on the basis of the evidence

3299895 were not trying to put on a show but playing the game the way we know how and when usa softball is playing the game hard and aggressively and playing smart thats really my only concern right now
3299896 it was a great show and i hope we put on more good shows throughout the week but right now were just doing what we do well
3299897 i was lucky enough to get a good pitch up in the zone and once i rounded first i saw the ball and thought maybe id make it
3299898 then once i saw coach candrea doing his little wave i knew i was going to go all the way
3299899 but you can expect us to keep putting the ball in play make defensive plays and the pitching staff to keep doing what theyve been doing
3299900 i just want to continue to raise the bar from 04 and prove to the world were the best the ultimate goal is getting the sport back to olympic competition in 2016 after it was dropped along with baseball for 2012 but right now its all about winning gold
3299901 i will not allow supporters from either side to question any of the other leaders sincerity in this race that said i will also not stand idly by while they question mine

3299918 i believe we were very unlucky last season we lost the premier league by four points
3299919 we got 14 more points than the season before so this year we want to make another step forward challenge even more and win the title we feel there is no reason why with a young squad we should be less good this year than last year

3299954 we do not have anything to lose i would not like my players to lose because of the greatness of bar a or because of their crest
3299955 we can lose i know against the team because that is football
3299956 we will play against a side that can also make mistakes there is a lot more pressure on them than us and they have made many changes this summer
3299957 i am sure that they will have moments that we can take advantage of
3299958 a draw in camp nou would be a very good result for us but it is a dream for me just to be here

3299969 take the fact that the online games sector is growing at four times the rate of overall internet growth together with the increasing numbers online and it is easy to see why companies such as mtv networks are looking to get a piece of the action
3299970 i am not very clear about the situation you raised for chinese journalists they very much enjoy the rights to cover the beijing olympic games
3299971 the senate speaker is trying yet again to please the chinese government by refusing to let the press cover a meeting between the dalai lama and members of the french parliament
3299972 poncelet is portraying it as a strictly private visit in which the senate does not want to be involved but in practice he is trying to prevent the press talking about an event of great importance for the tibetan community
3299973 the chinese government must launch an immediate and open investigation into these shootings
3299974 the pace of media is rapidly changing and any media organisation that cuts itself from the world of training is going to become a failing institution and will be further isolated from new ways of storytelling
3299975 we are also seeing a rapid transition towards visuals so the days of being a writer only or concentrating on a specific field of media are now gone there is a need to upgrade journalists skills to make them more versatile to any kind of reporting that comes their way
3299976 we have a much more complex issue in society which is gender and journalists need to mirror society through learning to speak the language of gender knowledge to be able to cover gender related stories very well
3299977 there is a general temptation for journalists to look for superwomen as potential sources especially by focusing on their relationships and private lives which is stereotypical and discriminatory while a large part of our communities rural women and rural children is absent from our media world especially newspapers
3299978 rural women have very important stories to tell but their voices can only be heard through radio
3299979 unfortunately radio is ephemeral meaning one or two broadcast programmes and then gone and forgotten we need the presence of print media in rural areas encouraging magazines and newspapers to send their staff to cover stories in rural society i think it is a dilemma but we would need the support of advertisers to achieve that feat
3299980 training institutions must also enter the fray and play a vital part in this struggle
3299981 sometimes newsrooms are not compatible with womens issues or are not that women friendly myths of male superiority and female mediocrity still prevail
3299982 so perhaps media training institutions should develop courses especially for women remove gender stereotypes in their curriculums and recruit more women into their ranks but mostly female journalists must do their best to advance themselves
3299983 we have really everything in common with america nowadays except of course language
3299984 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
