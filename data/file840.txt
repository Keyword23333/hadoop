8400001 terenul a fost amenajat deja pentru inceperea ridicarii halelor si a silozurilor iar din aceasta toamna vom initia constructia propriu zisa a fabricii de ulei comestibil
8400002 este un proiect important pentru noi si ne vom stradui sa ne ridicam la asteptarile lor aceasta este o industrie cu foarte multe provocari cu mult potential in romania si in mod evident instrumentele de comunicare trebuie sa fie pe masura

8400004 pozitia moscovei de cel mai scump oras din lume a fost intarita de aprecierea semnificativa a rublei in fata dolarului american si de continuarea cresterii preturilor de pe piata rezidentiala
8400005 majoritatea produselor realizate in romania erau exportate in marea britanie ungaria slovacia sau belgia insa odata cu investitiile din sectoarele logistic si de retail vanzarile catre piata locala au crescut vom continua investitiile la fabrica pe care o avem langa brasov pentru a acoperi necesarul de pe piata locala
8400006 in 2004 am decis impreuna cu niste parteneri sa achizitionam afacerea hi lo din marea britanie iar ulterior am cautat teren in toata tara pentru constructia unei fabrici am decis sa construim fabrica langa brasov datorita fortei de munca specializate in industrie

8400021 am achizitionat deja sase hectare de teren in apropiere de ploiesti si negociem alte preluari in zona pentru realizarea unui proiect rezidential si a unor spatii de birouri de asemenea ne uitam in zona de centru a tarii pentru terenuri in vederea constructiei a doua malluri

8400033 sex with students is bad but why should it be the case that for women its a case of poor boundaries and for men its hardcore brutal predation of the most evil sort
8400034 most of these women experts say dont go into teaching with plans to seduce a child the way a classic pedophile does what leads to their downfall is emotional immaturity
8400035 these teachers have a poor concept of boundaries so they dont recognize when theyve crossed the line into inappropriate behavior
8400036 in a lot of these cases the woman thinks she has fallen in love
8400037 but most of these women come from conflict ridden families where they didnt learn healthy social skills many learned to get their emotional needs for love attention approval met through sexual behavior
8400038 i see her as a really hurting adult who needs help i just hope she can get it
8400039 she was demoralized and feeling empty inside and he was the one to whom she could turn her attention
8400040 and she responded to that instead of the rules of society
8400041 i see her as a really hurting adult who needs help i just hope she can get it
8400042 oprah magazine female teachers who have sex with students are misguided poor souls looking for love

8400045 i dont think shes a sexual predator i see her as a really hurting adult who needs help i just hope she can get it
8400046 theres nothing wrong the boys thirteen and likely enjoyed the experience of having sex with a female teacher i dreamed of having sex with a my teacher when i was that age once
8400047 why is one genders sexual experience valued and assessed so differently from the others
8400048 isnt the article really saying that women just have no self control or self awareness

8400054 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers

8400056 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8400057 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8400058 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8400208 we cannot afford once again to make the wrong choice or to be taken in by the politics of fear
8400209 denver is where i grew up believing in the american dream and in a country that more than any other is associated with truth justice and freedom
8400210 the opportunity is too great and the stakes too high to allow president obamas agenda to be blocked by the special interests and their allies in the senate
8400211 with eyes firmly fixed on the future with the spirit of unity lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our next president
8400212 my fellow democrats my fellow americans i have never seen a moment like this i have never seen my country as energized as this
8400213 i cant tell you what an honor it is to be here today nominating barack obama and the next president of the united states
8400214 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies who will respect our veterans when they get back home instead of letting them languish without the medical care they deserve
8400215 no matter who you are no matter where youre from anything is possible in our america
8400216 another mother instilled that same dream in her son barack obama
8400217 for barack obama that dream runs deep in his soul
8400218 a president who will make sure that no matter who you are no matter where youre from you too can work hard to achieve the american dream

8400435 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8400436 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8400437 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8400438 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8400523 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8400524 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8400525 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8400526 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8400527 but we do hear from higher ed sources that those kids whove done well in writing or even had good writing instruction in high school tend to perform at higher levels in college
8400528 we know that college work requires complex levels of writing so teachers often use the mandated writing portfolios to nurture those
8400529 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8400530 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8400531 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8400532 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8400533 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8400534 these women are trying to kill each other with their super powers

8400536 sovereign lord as you have promised you now dismiss your servant in peace for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the sight of all people a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people israel
8400537 the true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world
8400538 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8400539 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8400540 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8400541 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8400542 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8400543 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8400544 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8400545 when you really want something all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it
8400546 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8400547 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8400548 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8400549 collectively these studies highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by sirna based therapies
8400550 this is one of the most promising breakthroughs in the management of high risk pregnancies in more than 30 years
8400551 the active ingredient we used in this study magnesium sulfate is better known as epsom salt
8400552 and virtually every delivery room in the united states is already stocked with magnesium sulfate solutions that are given to pregnant women during childbirth for other reasons
8400553 so what we have learned from this study is that we have a cheap widely available treatment already in hand that cuts in half the risk of babies being born with an extremely disabling disorder that is a tremendously exciting development
8400554 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8400555 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8400556 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8400557 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8400558 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8400559 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8400560 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8400561 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
8400562 clearly the statement that were not all the same is not exactly novel and yet im still struck by how homogenized people become when it comes to clinical trials
8400563 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8400564 mccain is wedded not just to the bush economic policy but also to the
8400565 senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs about the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona at the mccain estate
8400566 the most experienced compassionate and deserving person for the job my dear friend
8400567 breast cancer and prostate cancer develop due to many reasons but environmental factors and lifestyle play a major role in these cancers
8400568 when men and women from india and pakistan migrate to the united states their disease profiles change mirroring the american risk
8400569 we need to educate the immigrant population about risk factors as well as preventive measures they can take to reduce their risk of prostate breast cancer lung cancer and colon cancer
8400570 if it cant be done i have great concern that these hearings will be virtually or exclusively classified closed to the public and i might add to the detainees
8400571 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8400572 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8400573 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8400574 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon
8400575 has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to maintaining current equipment
8400576 we continue to lose confidence in the reliability of the equipment we are tasked to use to keep the system safe and efficient
8400577 if a minister embezzles or carries out any act of corruption would you hold the president liable the president is not responsible for a ministers mistake
8400578 as a liberator you are questioning me when you should be happy about my role
8400579 if we had not fought to get charles taylor out of your backs you wouldnt be sitting here today
8400580 this is a good example of customs and aqis working together at the border to protect australia and restrict unregulated international trade in wildlife
8400581 were sorry this site cant be embedded in a frame
8400582 the importance of the finding is that it opens up another avenue for us to develop treatments that might help folks with obesity
8400583 were looking at a small part of what is really a large and complex puzzle
8400584 we guess there are probably about 300 genes that affect body weight in some form or another
8400585 one approach to restore auditory function is to replace defective cells with healthy new cells
8400586 our work shows that it is possible to produce functional auditory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea
8400587 it remains to be determined whether gene transfer into a deaf mouse will lead to the production of healthy cells that enable hearing however we have made an important step toward defining an approach that may lead to therapeutic intervention for hearing loss
8400588 we found no evidence that either of the two treatments was superior to the other in the prevention of recurrent stroke
8400589 even though in science you always strive to find a superior treatment in this case it gives us options for treatment depending on the patient and their response to the different medications
8400590 now let them try to stop a pro style offense lets see how theyre going to do theyve had their advantage because i came into recruiting late
8400591 but now its xs and os time lets see who has the advantage now
8400592 im going to answer that very cautiously because i dont want to be called sarcastic using new jersey rhetoric so let me just say people better enjoy it now have their fun now
8400593 you have to evaluate the teacher and the teaching to see why you cant progress
8400594 i think that some of the creativity that comes in offense sometimes gets stymied when you have a domineering head coach that happens to be an offensive guy
8400595 in my section its rough when you see people flying over you
8400596 i cant just let that happen jets fans are the worst
8400597 if youre in arrowhead stadium wearing the opposing teams jersey youre going to make it out wearing someone elses beer
8400598 i hear a lot from people who have had bad experiences
8400599 all of us in the nfl are going to learn from one another about whats working in some stadiums the situations are going to vary theres not a one size fits all solution here
8400600 when people drink they dont know what theyre doing anyway
8400601 i dont think im going to be sober enough to press the buttons
8400602 i might be texting that theres a rowdy fan in section 121 and its me
8400603 the maps will only display offences that are reported to the police and reported crime figures are notoriously unreliable according to estimates at least 60 of crime goes unreported and some critics think the figure could be much higher according to criminologists areas with the most serious crime problems have the lowest reporting rates
8400604 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8400605 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8400606 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8400607 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8400608 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8400609 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8400610 danick proved to be an offensive force last year and was on pace for a 40 goal season before his injury ended his season
8400611 hes a work horse type player who is one of the best shot blockers in the echl but also displays great touch around the net danick is excited about getting the season underway so he can continue building off his strong junior career and his strong start to last year
8400612 this honor is really a tribute to the staff i have around me we are all so dedicated to seeing these players get better and continue to move up in the system
8400613 it gives everyone great confidence to have a guy like slama closing he brings the whole team up knowing he is your backend of the ballgame
8400614 when i look at wilson i see constant improvement thru the whole season hes also throwing out about 40 of the runners trying to steal on him
8400615 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine
8400616 now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
8400617 the addition of pydev to the aptana product suite rounds out the set of scripting languages that aptana already supports including ajax and javascript php ruby and ruby on rails and now python too pydev brings first class python support to aptana and sets the stage for a full suite of products and services from development through cloud deployment pydev is one of the most popular python ides for eclipse since aptana studio is also eclipse based it was the natural choice for aptana
8400618 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
8400619 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
8400620 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using ajax
8400621 offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
8400622 we are going to learn a great deal about ourselves because this schedule will definitely be a test for us hopefully we will be ready

8400644 i got an e mail from his national campaign manager he said senator obama remembered me from dinner and wanted me to do the honor of speaking for him
8400645 celebrate how everyday americans are coming together to change the course of a nation
8400646 just your average beer drinking guy down the street thats me
8400647 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8400648 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8400649 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8400650 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8400651 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8400652 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8400653 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8400654 hes done a lot for working class people and he has a lot of great foreign policy experience
8400655 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8400656 lets declare together with one voice right here right now barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8400657 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since
8400658 has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
8400659 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8400660 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8400661 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8400662 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8400663 because hes younger and represents change people are involved for the first time
8400664 the few things that i have learned it sounds like hes said some things that may be offensive and that makes me a little hesitant as to why he chose him as his vp
8400665 im behind obama so by default i guess im behind biden too
8400666 i was a college freshman that campaigned for kerry by handing out yard signs for a total of about 20 minutes
8400667 he came from a single parent home was raised partly by his grandparents and has become a leader
8400668 he is a symbol of the break from the bush dynasty and silver spoon politics its empowering
8400669 obama has really managed to reach out to the right mediums for example the text message for the vp choice
8400670 our thoughts have turned to the mother of this baby and we are concerned that she may need some help

8400672 it may be that she wants to speak to officers who are looking into the babys death
8400673 were talking about people refer to if you like as adult crimes and if these sort of crimes are being committed and the severity and frequency is increasing
8400674 i think its necessary to take a bit of a stronger view on it
8400675 i think a victims perspective would be more about protecting the public and protecting people from the crimes than protecting the

8400683 and why did frank eat the cheese in such a disagreeable manner
8400684 because he say the little boy in the cottage eat it that wayq
8400685 the little boy in the cottage who was excellent at weeding didnt know how to eat cheese without getting his fingers all sticky
8400686 no kate im afraid i will have to tell you
8400687 apes are apt to imitate every thing which they see done and they cannot as you can frank distinguish what is useful and agreeable from what is useless or disagreeable they imitate everything without reflecting
8400688 no but that he was acting like an ape as he was imitating the boy in the cottage without reflecting you will need to read this part again kate

8400700 ever since this happened ive been criticized for turning him in because of who he is
8400701 its going to be up to the department of education
8400702 as of today he can go right back to work that could change in the future

8400705 this second rescue effort was planned because a survey of the remaining aquatic habitat inside prospect island revealed a larger than expected number of fish that survived the dewatering of the island in 2007
8400706 realizing the bad press that they had received last year the bureau scheduled a fish rescue operation for august 25
8400707 however the announcement for the operation appears to have been bungled since the press release didnt reach fishing groups and many media outlets until monday morning
8400708 we are absolutely ecstatic about bringing acacia and kristin into the umass lacrosse family
8400709 their experience in lacrosse reaches the highest levels and they will be true assets not only as coaches but as role models to our student athletes as well
8400710 i could not be more ecstatic to be working with acacia again she has one of the most creative and innovative minds in lacrosse and i am very eager for her to mold our attack into one of the best in the country
8400711 alongside her coaching experience she is one of the top players in the world and that knowledge of the game from both perspectives is going to be an asset for our program she is a great person as well and that will benefit our student athletes on and off the field
8400712 kristin has a great passion and enthusiasm for lacrosse and that shows in how she teaches the game
8400713 we are very fortunate to have her on staff she was certainly a leader at new hampshire and learned a tremendous amount from her experience with the u s teams her energy and motivation is contagious and i think as a coach she conveys that to her players
8400714 the only clothes my two sisters and i have are what we are wearing
8400715 theres nothing else left in or of our house it was around 8 am on monday when a procession of swamijis followers was passing by suddenly around 100 men armed with iron rods and lathis attacked or house and tried to break in my brother moses my sister taruni and i stood with our backs to the door but we failed to stop them barge in we somehow escapes through our back door
8400716 the policemen stood right there along the mob and watched the entire scene
8400717 today we are going door to door in the neighbourhood begging for shelter only to be refused because we are christians
8400718 and now this is what i get in return i saw policemen in uniform and arms standing near my house and watching people set it on fire till now no police official or government men has come to us and ask about our plight
8400719 after the nayeks house they came to ours i just ran away with the children now we have no food no gas and are living under fear these children are my responsibility i only have some rice left to last a couple of days more with the curfew on and out of fear i cannot even go out
8400720 there were so many people shouting outside our maam told us to pray and we held each others hands when they came in we ran away
8400721 i do not know maam said they were bad people
8400722 i called the police for help but no one responded the mob were able to ransack the front portion of the house what can i say
8400723 over 300 people fled our village and have taken shelter in the forest since last monday after the mob attacked our village we took all we can and came here here we have almost nothing to eat there is a constant downpour our children are sick but we are alive thanks to god
8400724 we called the police when we were attacked nobody has come until now
8400725 we will arrange for relief camps shortly this includes in areas like firingia g udaygiri tikabali and k nuagan
8400726 we are doing our best to control the violence and protect the innocent the process takes some time i will look into the matter of police personnel present during any vandalism our priority is to restore law and order
8400727 to conduct any such practice is a serious offence and prohibited by law we will simply not allow this we are going to take up this issue with the civic body immediately releasing domestic animals in the forest area will be a wildlife disaster
8400728 the civic body cannot do this we will not allow them to do it we will write to them to stop this process

8400730 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships
8400731 and then there is the odd romance between americans and their roads they do not want anyone other than the government owning them
8400732 theres a huge opportunity that the u s public sector is in danger of losing it thinks there is a boatload of capital and when it is politically convenient it will be able to take advantage of it but the capital is going into infrastructure assets available today around the world and not waiting for projects the u s the public sector sic may sponsor in the future
8400733 hurry hurry hurry step right up and sell off your public infrastructure treasures financed by generations of previous taxpayers give them to wall street whom you just bailed out at discount prices and let them earn fantastic guaranteed rates of return for decades to come while cutting amenities and ignoring evolving public needs you poor schlumpy taxpayers can continue to shoulder the high risk long term investments and if any of those public assets begin to look attractive say the internet wifi spectrum or federally financed drug research why well be sure to swoop down and be the first take them away from you after all we have more money and better access to your elected leaders better than you do
8400734 oil companies will hold down oil prices a little bit you know to try to help the republican ticket
8400735 as it was when bill clinton was elected the first time
8400736 over two attractive white candidates hillary clinton and john edwards
8400737 you know if you were a real cynic you could also wonder if the oil companies might not be pulling the price of gas down to help the republicans get re elected in the midterm elections a couple of months away the interesting thing to watch on that story about gas prices is what happens to them right after the midterms john
8400738 hes got yet to prove substance or experience to be the president
8400739 he has become less respected since his decision to engage in slash and burn politics
8400740 over two attractive white candidates hillary clinton and john edwards
8400741 if not senator clinton who and if not now when
8400742 b ut the other issue especially for all those of us with daughters party aside you last night when you raised the fact that its been an american generation since geraldine ferraro and then you look at if not now when that becomes such an interesting question as we look at the bench on both the republican side and the democratic side
8400743 theres a winner and theres a loser barack obama won hillary clinton lost and clinton supporters need to get their heads if not their hearts around that
8400744 theres a point when a demand for respect turns into an aura of entitlement and some have been acting as if it were preordained that clinton would win the democratic nomination
8400745 ed rendell compared obama to the passive aggressive adlai stevenson and told the washington post that obama gives six minute answers and
8400746 first me must round up all the non believers then seperate the whites and make them live in a 12 block x 12 block area right michelle thats what we have to do right
8400747 it looks like baracks halo is losing its glow in some msm sectors
8400748 i dont know who perseus is but i hope he is somebody trying to bring fundamental change to washington
8400749 i am tired of being called a traitor because i like my flag and i like and i support the troops
8400750 2 billion of recovery money for katrina was squandered due to waste fraud and abuse
8400751 a long hard look at how this country handles disaster which ones they indirectly cause and how corporate america and their friends in the white house profit from those disasters in the long run
8400752 carde a network tv journo and cnbc anchor has made numerous visits to iraq since 2003 including a trip for this doc
8400753 and now of course the insight youre able to capture out on the trail you say its so much like a religious experience for people as they meet him lets see the view that you get look at them with their hands clasped
8400754 this is early on and you can just see the people are curious about him this was in springfield the day that he announced he was running for president this was in south carolina a lot of curiosity early on i think
8400755 inspired by obamas stand against the war and his less confrontational political style she visited his website and got involved
8400756 its amazing barack obama really does seem to have embraced technology and the internet even when you talk about text messaging the announcement that joe biden would be his running mate
8400757 well this was president howard deans plan too you know the magic of the internet is going to swamp regular politics and it didnt happen
8400758 i was in the hallway managed to avoid the secret service
8400759 well judging from the crowd pretty damn good and he says to me she knocked it out of the park home run home run im so proud of her so you could obviously see a very jubilant ex president walking the halls here in denver
8400760 blue waters will be an unrivaled national asset that will have a powerful impact on both science and society
8400761 scientists around the country simulating new medicines or materials the weather disease outbreaks or complex engineered systems like power plants and aircraft are poised to make discoveries that we can only begin to imagine
8400762 we are excited blue waters embodies an important piece of nsfs vision for its office of cyberinfrastructure to provide the worlds leading scientists and engineers with unprecedented petascale computing resources to work at the frontiers of knowledge
8400763 with this collaboration and investment researchers may tackle previously unimaginable questions and realize unparalleled discoveries generating new understanding about the earths climate the functioning of national and global economies nanoscale engineering the design of advanced materials the evolution of the early universe the molecular processes that sustain life possibilities abound
8400764 our community traditionally uses peak performance to measure the output of a system based on simple benchmarks its a measure thats never achieved in real life
8400765 with blue waters were focused intently on sustained performance genuine performance on codes that scientists and engineers use every day instead of unattainable benchmark figures
8400766 a system with a large amount of globally addressable memory might come in at two terabytes of memory blue waters will have 500 times that this configuration makes blue waters a unique resource for the most compute memory and data intensive applications handling data in this way means a broad range of researchers can get all of their work done in one place and dont have to move among different machines with specialized architectures
8400767 our relationship with illinois ncsa and their partners throughout the country will help deliver an extraordinary new system
8400768 the work to come on blue waters will usher in a new era in supercomputing ultimately providing a powerful new platform for scientists engineers and commercial users
8400769 for decades the university of illinois at urbana champaign has been a leader in high performance computing the blue waters project is the latest in our rich tradition of innovation
8400770 it will impact research in countless disciplines not only across our campus but for researchers around the world this truly is a national resource

8400780 no well intentioned person can doubt that argentina is going to meet each and every one of its commitments
8400781 argentina is a friendly country to people who want to come and invest
8400782 its even more friendly for those whove put in a dollar and want to keep putting in more dollars because that generates work for argentines
8400783 the 2 million dollar bills dream is one step closer the barbados plan is happening

8400785 republicans caution against the doomsday climate change scenarios peddled by aficionados of centralized command and control government
8400786 we can and should address global warming without succumbing to the no growth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly

8400789 people who now have a mortgage equal to 90 per cent of their house value would see that mortgage fall to just 72 per cent of the house value implying that it would take a very unlikely price fall of more than 28 per cent to push those individuals into negative equity
8400790 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8400791 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8400792 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8400793 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon
8400794 has taken its eye off the ball when it comes to maintaining current equipment
8400795 we continue to lose confidence in the reliability of the equipment we are tasked to use to keep the system safe and efficient
8400796 this represents a major step forward in our understanding of the dry form of macular degeneration
8400797 and with the identification of this potential target we can try to develop treatments for a disease which for the moment we cant treat
8400798 this raises particular concerns regarding rnai therapy for wet amd
8400799 but by establishing this link between the treatment for the wet form of amd and the potential harmful effect on the dry form of the disease we can perhaps better understand the mechanisms of both diseases
8400800 half of them report sleep disturbances during their menstrual periods three quarters of expectant mothers report that sleep is more disturbed during pregnancy and many experience disrupted sleep during menopause in part due to nighttime
8400801 if deemed to be at high or immediate risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks women and their doctors should consider using magnesium sulfate to prevent their child from having cerebral palsy
8400802 we define high risk as threatening delivery prior to 32 weeks
8400803 its too early to know if magnesium sulfate has an overall effect on the incidence rate of cerebral palsy
8400804 overall there was no difference in the two groups people taking telmisartan and those taking placebo
8400805 however we did find a difference in that those who were in the study longer the drug had an effect compared to those who were in the study for a short time
8400806 these effects have not been seen early after a stroke they may be more delayed
8400807 the follow up time in this study was only two a half years and it may have hurt us
8400808 but this study in itself doesnt say you have to use angiotensin ii receptor blocker early
8400809 other studies have suggested that these drugs may be better for stroke risk reduction but in this study we cant say that
8400810 the two drugs were essentially the same in terms of their ability to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke as well as reducing the risk of heart attack and death after a stroke
8400811 both drugs are equally effective neither drug is superior to the other in terms of reducing a recurrent stroke
8400812 the addition of bortezomib velcade resulted in significant prolongation in time to disease progression with a reduction of 52 percent in risk of progression
8400813 there was also a significant prolongation of survival with a 40 percent reduction in the risk of death
8400814 the benefit of velcade was not only observed in good risk patients but also in high risk patients
8400815 we now have a new standard of care for newly diagnosed patients
8400816 we are in a new era in the treatment of myeloma
8400817 we have a new paradigm of relatively easy drugs compared to the usual chemotherapy which is adding to quality of life and longevity in myeloma thats a big deal
8400818 the future with repetitive doses of lower doses of medicine to control the myeloma is clearly surfacing
8400819 its an exciting time in the treatment of myeloma and this treatment represents a significant additional option for patients with myeloma who are not candidates for transplant those who are over 65 or may have other significant illnesses that prevent them from being considered for transplant
8400820 now with all the new treatments we have be it the bone marrow transplant or whether it be the use of the newer drugs the outlook for myeloma patients has improved considerably
8400821 there was an error opening the file the file is damaged and could not be repaired
8400822 it drove me mad for the last couple days as there are a tons of posts out there that suggests various things
8400823 i was about 20 feet behind the american flag and when i walked through the stadium and the light hit the flag it was i just couldnt take my eyes off of it
8400824 because thats the focal point thats the reason were there were there because of the united states i love our flag i love our country and thats what im doing serving our country the best that i can
8400825 when i saw the flag being raised it was just a dream come true because i had been dreaming about that moment ever since i started shooting olympic style skeet
8400826 it was just a flood of emotions that ive never felt before i wasnt really prepared for it dreaming about it ive tried to simulate every possible feeling that i would get while up on the podium i got a lot of them but it was even more than i could expect
8400827 with a situation like vincents it brings the eyes of the world on our little community the first thing everybody in the community wanted to do was say thank you to vincent for all hes done for his community as well as his country
8400828 in a small town like this you dont have too many celebrities come from here
8400829 author alice walker was probably our first big celebrity and now theres vincent
8400830 i was reading my book the driver honked the horn slammed on the brakes and the train goes squish
8400831 not much was going through my head stuff happens i used to be with search and rescue and i ve seen this from the other side often enough
8400832 everyone basically just grabbed their cellphones called 911 and made sure everybody was ok
8400833 considering the train did derail and depending on the volume of passengers that could have been on the train and if it were a different time of day things could have been substantially worse
8400834 the driver as well as a patient we took sustained the brunt of the collision because it was at the front of the train but even he is in stable condition at this point in time
8400835 all i can say at this point is there was a miscommunication as to whether or not the boom was supposed to be over the track when the train hit it
8400836 i would say it s unlikely that there will be any criminal charges from the police end i imagine it would be something that occupational health and safety and their own departments look at as far as the people involved will be dealt with
8400837 they had requested a lane closure which is also deemed a signal lockout and that was authorized for 10 30 a m
8400838 if you look at the distance from where the boom is which is where contact was made and where the train stopped you can see how fast it was going
8400839 the train is travelling about 80 kilometres an hour so we can see it was quite an abrupt halt
8400840 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8400841 without a special verdict form its difficult to see how an injunction would be styled
8400842 the main bratz brand will always remain with mga and we are going full blast forward and nothing will stop us
8400843 the jury made a determination about damages but it didnt make a determination about the connection between the drawings and the damages
8400844 the stakes still remain very very high for mga theyre not out of the woods yet at all
8400845 the real prize is going to be can mattel convince the judge to grant an injunction that would prevent mga from ever producing another bratz product

8400857 the guy looked shaken at first i believed the whole thing he was with police next to the church there
8400858 unfortunately this man had to pay his mortgage and resorted to that kind of action kind of sad
8400859 the brain boosters group is an opportunity for veterans to not only learn about brain injury but to learn about what aspects they can control to improve their brain function
8400860 we provide hands on activities so veterans can practice the new skills they have learned in the group
8400861 the brain is much like a muscle that needs exercise
8400862 although the brain boosters group is relatively new both dr bushnell and i are very enthusiastic about its potential were getting very positive feedback from the veterans who have participated
8400863 i think its gotten a lot better because of participating in the group
8400864 it helped us focus more on healing that part of the brain that was not working well the people at the va are very caring and concerned they answered all our questions and got us what we needed

8400866 players around the world will use a range of media including the young bond books themselves and the worldwide web to complete the missions and influence the outcome of the game
8400867 we think reading is sitting down and reading a novel but there are all sorts of reading
8400868 kids can get as engrossed in a football magazine as they can in a history book or novel we shouldnt be dismissive of other forms of literature i used to read tons of comic books when i was a kid
8400869 were always looking for new ways to get people interested
8400870 especially the sort of person who wouldnt be hanging around in a childrens bookshop or reading a worthy magazine in a school library this is a way of getting other kids interested who might not know about the books
8400871 its just finding the time to get it right its very difficult to find a kid with the charisma to pull off the character of bond at that age

8400878 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8400879 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8400880 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8400881 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8400900 the digital hospital goes beyond advanced clinical systems and includes significant additional integration between medical and information technologies that have historically been beyond the scope of a hospitals information technology strategy
8400901 you cant find a prescription pad in any of our hospitals
8400902 this cuts down on errors because physicians handwriting is so often illegible this hasnt been implemented much in the civilian sector yet weve been doing it for 15 years
8400903 comprises a completely automated and deeply integrated set of health information services capabilities that fulfill clinical financial and administrative requirements the common elements are core technologies and automated processes
8400904 implementing the digital hospital concept requires the integration of many subsystems substantial benefits may not appear until a sufficient level of automation a tipping point has been reached
8400905 health care organizations are having difficulty moving data from one place to another because the data means different things to different systems to pull all of that data together we need to migrate to agreed upon standards
8400906 we must maintain a focus that is outcome driven rather than technology driven
8400907 staff will need to change the way they work possibly dropping older systems and adopting specific work processes designed to maximally exploit the capabilities of a given system
8400908 many of our senior more experienced clinicians may never have learned how to use a computer
8400909 if you throw technology at them it is very challenging for them to adopt but we cant leave them behind because their clinical knowledge is extensive
8400910 it doesnt do any good to have an automated appointment system if providers are not utilizing it
8400911 there is definitely a gap in the ability of end users to adapt to technology
8400912 sometimes you introduce a technology to make one procedure better but it complicates something else
8400913 the hospital could automatically be locked down if a baby is carried off beyond where he or she is supposed to be
8400914 the technology is still not quite as mature as the vendor community would have you believe
8400915 if you need one in every room it is not going to make sense that is the kind of technical issue rfid is still up against
8400916 management will ensure these departments develop better budget estimates in future years
8400917 if these novel findings are confirmed in a randomized controlled trial they may lead to prevention of these very common cancers at least among individuals at very high risk
8400918 we had a lot of people serve in a lot of dangerous places other than korea and vietnam
8400919 there were 40 aircraft shot down and 116 soldiers missing in action from the cold war
8400920 too often when these young men and women return home from service we do not honor their bravery with the full measure of respect and gratitude that it deserves
8400921 i believe we should take this opportunity to help ensure that our veterans regardless of the timeframe of their service receive appropriate recognition and benefits
8400922 there were a lot of sacrifices made and people served a lot of hazardous duty during that time
8400923 va is committed to providing primary care and mental health care for veterans in rural areas
8400924 health care should be based upon the needs of patients not their ability to travel to a clinic or medical center
8400925 i have to say katie holmes has become so much more sophisticated in so many ways but i think shes in a dip right now i cant explain it she ascended from this tomboyish waif look to an incredible sexy sophisticate we realize how much style shes capable of i dont get it
8400926 there is no way in hell he should have been deployed the army saw him as just another set of boots on the ground
8400927 from the second tour on he changed 180 degrees three deployments is two too many the army took my husband from me the army destroyed my husband
8400928 army leaders are fully aware that repeated deployments have led to increased distress and anxiety for both soldiers and their families
8400929 there appears to be a direct relationship between the incidence of suicide and the number of deployments which of course is no surprise
8400930 the army is making great strides in treating soldiers with post traumatic psychological symptoms as well as decreasing the stigma associated with treatment for these symptoms
8400931 were not here to make you better were here to make you deployable
8400932 everyone treats you like crap theres a huge stigma to asking for help
8400933 but the real problem is the ptsd the real problem is the mental health condition
8400934 now making them better may mean taking them from a non deployable to a deployable status obviously theres a war going on but the goal is making them better
8400935 anything that burned reminded him of the sights and sounds of picking up bodies at the pentagon
8400936 chad would get very severe migraines that would knock him to his knees
8400937 he served his country for 12 years he went through more hell in one year than you and i will in a lifetime
8400938 the army takes suicide prevention very seriously we are honor bound to ensure we do everything possible to minimize potential risks
8400939 just had to sit and talk to someone over a tv
8400940 i thought well if thats how theyre going to treat you at least youre talking to someone
8400941 i know that he was by himself he sat in his room and played a video game
8400942 the outcome as well as patient satisfaction was the same
8400943 she was telling people she was going to kill herself
8400944 she had evidently told people about the history of abuse
8400945 she was laughing and singing she was sent with a male to the chaplain the chaplain couldnt speak very good english told her to start obeying orders it was a series of people who could have done something better
8400946 friendly fire because they failed to take care of a fellow soldier
8400947 he just kept doing it he was in love with her she was trying to get away from him
8400948 he verbally and physically assaulted her it was reported to the higher command
8400949 he was e mailing her and e mailing her and e mailing her she wouldnt answer his e mails he went into her room killed her and then he killed himself
8400950 the last time he assaulted her he drove around looking for her that was probably a week or two before he killed her
8400951 i asked after the second assault what did yall do then the only thing they told me was a lot of mistakes were made
8400952 chaplains are constantly working to prevent suicide at every level most importantly at the soldier level
8400953 caution is warranted in beginning changing stopping and or continuing
8400954 they sent him to anger management classes feeling somewhat deserted by his father he was so young they had also put him in suicide watch in boot camp
8400955 that is a suicidal medicine especially with teens i was livid i just couldnt believe they put him on prozac
8400956 both prozac and paxil are in the class of medications called ssris which are a very safe category of antidepressants
8400957 and they put me on something else they changed my medicine gave me a week of stress management
8400958 i dont think he should have ever been sent there why would you deploy someone who was a danger to himself and maybe others when they know its just unacceptable pushing them out there
8400959 dont worry it is impossible that a son of so many tears should be lost
8400960 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go

8401013 does not come without risks accusations that he plagiarized then british labour party leader neil kinnock helped sink his presidential campaign in 1987
8401014 biden stole autobiographical material in effect making false claims about his own life
8401015 biden and reporters covering his campaign said that in speeches before and after that debate the senator has given kinnock credit for the same passionate rhetoric which he has used repeatedly in recent weeks
8401016 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it
8401017 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
8401018 we dont think this credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8401019 i dont like to make predictions but i think its going to continue to be very challenging and as i said i think the number of banks and assets on the troubled bank list will continue to go up
8401020 about half a trillion dollars in borrowing authority and they need a vehicle to own these banks while we triage them and sell them

8401022 traders are still focused on gustavs potential effects for now
8401023 if gustav does become a serious problem given that places like russia and venezuela are not pumping at peak capacity we could see prices head right back into the 130 to 140 area especially since equities do not appear to be an appealing investment gustav is expected to regain hurricane status once it passes over cuba

8401031 the exciting part of the commissions work here is that this is very doable
8401032 for the first time it quantifies the emissions reductions benefits of a variety of options and lays out a road map we can take whether as an individual consumer or as a state government
8401033 the exciting part of the commissions work here is that this is very doable for the first time it quantifies the emissions reductions benefits of a variety of options and lays out a road map we can take whether as an individual consumer or as a state government
8401034 i look forward to carefully reviewing the report and working with all stakeholders to develop both short and long term strategies to address climate change
8401035 that aggressive pollution targets are possible and good for the state not only environmentally but economically
8401036 maryland is less than three tenths of 1 percent of the u s emissions and the u s is not even the largest country in terms of greenhouse gas emissions anymore
8401037 we believe these issues should be addressed on a national level
8401038 not in sync with past and present climate conditions these costs are likely to increase as climate change accelerates
8401039 the costs of inaction are likely to stay and increase
8401040 by lagging behind other states that are already investing in the fast growing clean energy industry maryland is missing out on huge economic development and growth potential
8401041 it sounds as though this is forward thinking its aggressive and particularly appropriate for a state as vulnerable to climate change as maryland
8401042 i support barack obama because america needs a president with the strength wisdom and courage to talk with our enemies and consult with our allies
8401043 no matter where we stood during the campaign democrats stand together today
8401044 if deemed to be at high or immediate risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks women and their doctors should consider using magnesium sulfate to prevent their child from having cerebral palsy
8401045 we define high risk as threatening delivery prior to 32 weeks
8401046 its too early to know if magnesium sulfate has an overall effect on the incidence rate of cerebral palsy
8401047 its very hard to understand the exposure place and timing
8401048 otherwise healthy people tend not to die from west nile many have no symptoms at all
8401049 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8401050 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8401051 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments

8401056 she would have anywhere between 50 to 100 seizures a day
8401057 right now she has one seizure every two weeks and it lasts maybe 20 seconds
8401058 its very restrictive down to what toothpaste they use toms of maine is the only toothpaste available in this country that doesnt have carbohydrates to in it
8401059 its not easy for the parents but it can be effective at treating seizures
8401060 children are limited to 10 grams of carbohydrates per day and from that are subtracted any grams of carbohydrates in medications that they take
8401061 to see the improvement in her makes us want to do it everyday it makes it worth it to us
8401062 we dont have any evidence that says this happens in fact we follow these children very closely theyre growing children they have epilepsy they probably are our most followed patients because not only do we want to make sure their seizures are controlled but if were manipulated their diet so dramatically we want to make sure theyre growing normally
8401063 his goal is to talk to the american people about the challenges we face and what we need to do to solve them and the stakes of continuing to do what we are doing
8401064 i will leave it to others to decide the inspiration factor
8401065 there are stark differences on the economy senator mccain thinks were on the right path and senator obama knows most people disagree with that
8401066 mccain is wedded not just to the bush economic policy but also to the bush foreign policy
8401067 senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs about the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona at the mccain estate
8401068 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8401069 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8401070 both in the entertainment community and with the american people the momentum continues to build for this cause
8401071 were setting out to give the public a show that is entertaining and inspiring and were starting a movement that can revolutionize the way we approach this disease
8401072 im hoping that we can have a better weekend at misano though i had bad luck there last year another rider knocked me off at the very first corner the misano circuit is quite fast but it feels tight and narrow the grip level is ok and last year we used medium compound tyres because it was quite hot the track was also very bumpy last year which was probably its worst feature from a set up point of view the most important thing at misano is having good braking power and good stability when accelerating out of the corners its the kind of track that requires you to ride aggressively
8401073 im certainly excited to be getting back out there with the boys because i hated missing brno ive been seeing doctors and im going to get some moulded support to wear in my boot ive been doing some training in the pool and a few things at the gym nothing too crazy misano is almost a laguna without the hills its a tight little scrappy track where you need a bike you can be aggressive with i enjoyed it last year but id just as soon they flipped it back around and go the old direction for those big lefts that used to go on to the back straightaway i remember seeing the old 500 guys riding those on tv
8401074 misano is not one of my favourite tracks but i cant wait to ride in front of my fans my fan club will be taking up an entire grandstand decked in the colours of the san marino flag and giving me an extra push to ride on the limit from a technical point of view everything is in place for a top performance the bridgestone tyres are really competitive and last year at misano they worked really well on paper the track looks as though it should be well suited to our bike because there arent any long straights racing at home obviously provides an extra motivation but well try to retain our focus from the first session and not get carried away with the excitement
8401075 we had two days of really important tests after the czech gp trying out a variety of different settings with the new bike which was impossible during the race weekend in particular we found a front setting that should also prove to be a good option at misano i know this weekends grand prix is very special for the team and in a way it is like a second home race for me too because i only live ten minutes away from the track ill do everything i can to provide the team with a good result and after that fourth place at brno it would be fantastic to get on the podium
8401076 this for me is my home grand prix so i am excited to run in front of my fans and the many friends who wish me support on the many internet forums the track itself is pretty slow because there are many curves and the straights are short but this could help during the race everyone is motivated to get a good result for both the italian public and for my championship position last year i went well in practice and qualifying but then in the race i was a victim of a mechanical problem so i have unfinished business here
8401077 brno was a bad experience for me and the crew but we must continue our job to find a solution for front grip we tested some michelin tyres there but we could not find any important improvement so we decided to end that testing session early and proceed with our set up work in here at misano i like the track and we need to work hard with hrc and michelin to close the gap to the fastest riders we need to avoid the troubles we suffered in brno and im sure michelin is working hard to find a solution for this weekend we will have a lot of sponsors and friends here and i absolutely want to be more competitive like at laguna seca and germany
8401078 for me the grand prix of san marino is my second race at home as i lived for some years in cattolica a few kilometres from the circuit and i feel the thrill of racing in italy the track is not fast and i think that this could be favourable to my honda with the changes made to the circuit i will see how things have altered and whether this will influence things either way i want to make a good race for my team
8401079 im looking forward to riding here and getting into action again after brno the track is quite tight and we should have an opportunity to do well i really want to end the season strongly and pay back all the hard work the team has put in throughout the year so far

8401085 as a trader i need to be so early i out anticipate every other trader out there so im going to buy consumer discretionary on the first glint of a silver lining or even an imagined glint
8401086 people were not in the restaurants in the volume we were anticipating
8401087 for a large part of that period gas prices were extraordinarily high
8401088 it was a challenging consumer environment and its possible that consumers at the tail end of the quarter were watching phelps instead of going out
8401089 gas is dropping from 4 19 to 3 79 and hence the consumer is back
8401090 yes but thats in the past and if you look ahead 6 months through the valley of muck the housing picture will improve credit conditions will improve commodity costs will fall and the consumer will be better because energy costs will be down i urge you to buy darden stock at these rock bottom prices job seekers search jobs by category get job alerts by email or live feed apply online
8401091 we are excited to offer a local colorado band on stage during one of our best selling concerts
8401092 we were held in separate rooms and non stop interrogated for 22 hours the major issue they had with me and conley was that what we were doing taking and broadcasting photographs was a worse crime than the people who were holding a sign because we were broadcasting it for the world to see and thats a bigger crime in china than the protesters who were breaking the law
8401093 im not the public speaker in the group so well try this
8401094 if senator mccain continues to be the schmuck hes being were going to play there you know and go tell some truth

8401098 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy

8401100 music critics have constantly stated that m base is a musical style and this is not true since the beginning of time critics have by and large been unable to deal with any creative expression m base is a way of thinking about creating music it is not the music itself one of the main ideas in m base is growth through creativity as we learn through our experiences then the music will change and grow to reflect that the idea is not to develop some musical style and to play that forever
8401101 yeah really its human nature that you can flirt in the moment but the person you truly care about is worth being on your mind male or female
8401102 isnt this true with either gender or person that can actually say they truly did love someone in some way or another im mean obviously guys have emotions and any girl who thinks they dont are just bitter bitches
8401103 eh yeah if theyre jealous but its the same way with girls funny thing is girls are very vocal about their jealousy guys tend to brood quietly until they snap
8401104 thats with anybody seriously this makes me think that if you have to tell girls this do they just not have any common sense just because hes a guy doesnt mean hes not a person and just like you ladies have insecurities and want to feel loved etc so on and so forth cmon youre not that stupid are you
8401105 stupid 1 slow to learn or understand obtuse 2 tending to make poor decisions or careless mistakes 3 marked by a lack of intelligence or care foolish or careless a stupid mistake
8401106 a usual act that proves that a kim chimeny likes you is when she teases you
8401107 and yes true in most cases its called flirting p
8401108 i could argue this in many ways through various examples but the bottom line is people fall in love differently at different rates and for different reasons speaking of one loving another more based on gender alone is very presumptuous to say the least
8401109 this is more of the way a perosn looks at it its true with many people but not always the case for instance for me personally beauty only really pretains to nature scenery or some really awe inspiring everything else is cute pretty etc even people i love a whole hell of alot then theres people that say that everybody is beautiful or gorgeous etc
8401110 again this is a personality thing i know plenty of guys and girl who do exactly this and will talk to other people to figure it out sometimes but i also know guys and girls who never do this so depends on who they are
8401111 i do this as well and the only real reason im comparing myself is to in a sense kinda say that some girls are like this too it depends on the person
8401112 eh for the most part yes if someone admits it to themselves and others around them then its true if they just say that because the other person is upset for some reason it would be questionable on its reliablity
8401113 well its half a personality trait if theyre a serious person or a jokster and half that even if the person in question likes to joke around alot doesnt mean that something has to be
8401114 its called mystery girls like mystery guys like mystery mystery is power that aside not all guys think this its only the ones that think that are the guys who make girls out to be something theyre not bottom line is everybody is human you just have to think about whether the indivdual is emotionally driven logic prone or a balance of both and most times you can figure them out
8401115 thats easy pop some estrogen pills that send you emotions through the roof do something that you know will make you angry and hate all penises because you have a vagina and they want to be inside it
8401116 so then how do people live on their own and how come more guys are successful on their own then women
8401117 oh yeah remember when i tried to get a job there i wonder why i didnt get it

8401172 so the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval of her eyes

8401185 one of our big concerns is preservation of rural pharmacies
8401186 with population decline we would worry about the viability of those rural pharmacies if that law were to go away
8401187 it would be a nice convenience for customers to have
8401188 i think times have changed that law is an old law i dont think it necessarily serves the people of north dakota the best

8401240 everybody says he has been a hard worker on the football field and athletics but he was just as hard a worker in scouts and life in general
8401241 he already had gotten his eagle scout and even in scouting he wanted to do his best in everything he could and he did
8401242 matthew came into the troop as a fifth grader and i got to know him pretty well because i was pretty close buddies with robbie
8401243 i went on a bunch of camping trips and tented with rob and mr gfeller and matt on some occasions we went to scout camps for a week at a time and you really get to know somebody well after spending that much time with him
8401244 he loved football you can look at his facebook profile and his interests were football and speed exercises to reach peak performance
8401245 he has always been the one thats coming the next great football player at reynolds and he was
8401246 they live in this beautiful house and he had this piece of paper taped on his door with his football goals and his no 1 goal was to start at reynolds as a sophomore
8401247 he had a sign over his door that said football is my life
8401248 he was a really unusual boy in that anything he did he did with all his heart
8401249 students like matt are the bonuses you get when youre a teacher
8401250 when matthew left we were so sad because here was someone who made us laugh here was someone who was willing take on any role he had no inhibitions about putting himself out and doing what he knew was fun and what was good to do
8401251 as i understand it he was doing exactly the same thing at reynolds with football
8401252 he had some very unique qualities for a 15 year old
8401253 he was a very teachable kid and not just in terms of subject matter but in terms of life lessons he listened and he responded matthew was his own person in many ways
8401254 overall the mood has been fairly optimistic about things and i think a lot of that has to do for kids who are 14 and 15 getting into the routine helps a lot about understanding and moving through the grief and seeing that a part of life is tragedy at times
8401255 we went out there walked around a little bit said a prayer where we believed it happened and then we strapped up and got going
8401256 i was personally nervous about going back out there but once we got out there i felt at ease peaceful it was tough to describe

8401260 the animals have bad reaction to the gas vomiting urinating and fighting you never know whats going to happen in there
8401261 the problem in the long term is that they dont know theyre getting exposed and just opening and closing the door they get exposed and this can lead to cancer and heart disease
8401262 ive seen bad situations with the chamber and ive seen bad situations with injections so i dont think you can just categorize it and say its good either way
8401263 you still have a dead animal at the end of the process the result is still an animal that has not found its way into a loving home because some irresponsible pet owner failed to get their pet neutered
8401264 the saab 9 x biohybrid blends organic form with ecologically sound propulsion for both aesthetic and environmental appeal
8401265 saab takes center stage with a new design approach for a compact vehicle with the biohybrid turbo engine included we have a winner
8401266 we are honored by this important recognition from an expert north american media organization
8401267 following in the footsteps of the highly inspirational aero x and the 9 4x biopower crossover concept which also debuted earlier this year the 9 x biohybrid demonstrates that saab is truly on the move
8401268 this car is all about efficiency in design and performance
8401269 you could say we designed this car from back to front
8401270 the shape of the 9x is right for a car of this size and the longer roof line helps the aerodynamics as well as providing more rear headroom and interior space
8401271 this car shows how our concept work can be carried forward into a compact format
8401272 it has a number of features which we will be developing further such as the new driver focused design theme the importance of clean uncluttered surfaces and the easy seamless connectivity inside the car

8401288 tener atenci n m dica fue importante porque hace 5 a os no hab a acceso a la medicaci n por el alto costo o por la homofobia a la gente homosexual porque yo soy homosexual esto me hizo adquirir un compromiso con esta cl nica y con mi persona para hacer un buen tratamiento hasta que mi cuerpo aguante ten a un grupo de amigos y ramos unos 30 y est n casi todos muertos por no tener un tratamiento
8401289 me infect por la v a sexual la informaci n en aquel entonces era muy poca y no hab a garant as de que alguien tuviera relaciones con otra persona y estuviera sana ni siquiera serv a preguntarle porque era una forma de discrminarla m s todav a
8401290 el tratamiento es bueno y gratuito y la atenci n en la cl nica es excelente desde la recepci n las trabajadoras sociales los doctores las enfermeras los infect logos los dentistas los pat logos los digo en este orden porque es as como vamos pasando por los distintos sectores cuando ingresamos la gente que me conoce sabe que vengo aqu eso no me importa a m pero s las consecuencias de esta discriminaci n hacia mi familia
8401291 sigo teniendo el problema del vih pero le doy gracias a dios porque me toc un buen m dico s tuve este problema y gracias a dios y a los medicamentos estoy saliendo porque estoy engordando como ver n
8401292 trabajaba en la cl nica de un dentista y me piqu con una jeringa no sab a pero cuando me enferm me hicieron los an lisis y sal con vih lo hab a visto en la televisi n pero nunca supuse que iba a salir con esta infecci n yo era ignorante sobre este tema y por eso la gente debe cuidarse
8401293 conoci la noticia y me hizo a un lado a pesar de que sigue viviendo en mi casa no me besa no me abraza y ni siquiera come de la comida que le hago es mi pena y mi desconsuelo ella tiene hijos y no sabe si alguno de ellos tambi n podr estar enfermo
8401294 gente que me quiere y no me discrimina en la cl nica que nos dan confianza y amor
8401295 mandar un abrazo para todos los infectados del mundo y quiero que sepan que hay medicaci n que tengan fe en dios y en los m dicos
8401296 soy portador del vih y vivo desde hace 11 a os en una casa de recuperaci n por alcoholismo y drogas le doy gracias a dios porque me tocaron buenos doctores me estoy recuperando y le digo a dios que haga una vacuna para esta enfermedad que es progresiva y mortal en este siglo podr salir si dios nos presta vida
8401297 no supe en realidad c mo obtuve esta enfermedad porque durante muchos a os me inyect hero na tanto en tijuana como despu s en la c rcel de la ciudad de m xico tambi n con gente de ese tiempo en distintas reas de esta ciudad no supe si fue a trav s de una inyecci n o de un acto sexual
8401298 le pido a la gente que sea conciente de las cosas si no sabe sobre este mal de la humanidad que es esta enfermedad le doy gracias a mi ser superior que me mantiene vivo mi familia me quiere y no me ha rechazado pero quiero que haya una vacuna para que el mundo se cure de esta enfermedad porque s nos discrminan
8401299 disculpen que me exprese as pero es mi sentir le quiero decir a todo el mundo que dios est aqu y est viendo por nosotros
8401300 llevo cinco a os con este problema del vih y estoy agradecida a la instituci n porque est n muy capacitados hay medicamentos y mucha humanidad en la gente que nos atiende espero que llegue la vacuna
8401301 soy alcoh lica y he tenido dos parejas cuando tomaba hace 6 a os tom un taxi para ir a mi casa lo nico que me acuerdo es que amanec en un hotel me imagino que me contagi de esa persona porque los hombres con los que conviv son muy sanos y est n bien creo que as fue porque no hay otra explicaci n
8401302 en mi familia todos saben de mi enfermedad pero no mis vecinos me comprenden y tengo mucho amor y apoyo de ellos despu s de lo que me pas me abstuve completamente del sexo me sirvi una vez para aprender la lecci n
8401303 me infect en 2004 por mi esposo quien consum a drogas creo que sa fue la manera fue mi nica pareja y sigue en las drogas s que est enfermo pero no se atiende llegu a la cl nica muy mal estuve deambulando en diferentes hospitales durante dos o tres meses y mi enfermedad aumentaba luego llegu a esta cl nica y gracias al tratamiento y a las atenciones m dicas que recib estoy viva mi esposo me abandon y ahora tengo una nueva pareja que est sana y sabe de mi enfermedad usamos cond n todas las veces que tenemos relaciones sexuales
8401304 los medicamentos te pican los dientes y si son fuertes te dan sue o pero los m dicos controlan esto
8401305 me preocupa que la gente me vea llegar a la cl nica pero por otra parte les estoy mostrando que la enfermedad es controlable
8401306 lo importante no ser a la vacuna para esta enfermedad sino la responsabilidad de cada uno de su propia vida no voy a poner mi vida en las manos de nadie
8401307 educar a los pol ticos y a la poblaci n sobre esta enfermedad para que se acabe con la discriminaci n y promover el uso del preservativo para evitar el contagio del virus hay mucha gente sobre todo hombres que no quieren usar el cond n y despu s s lo viene el llanto y el lamento
8401308 el primer centro fue abierto en 1988 y estaba destinado a atender a personas de zonas marginadas pero posteriormente en 1998 se convirti en la primera unidad de atenci n de personas con vih en la ciudad
8401309 lo m s importante son los usuarios y por eso el personal est sensibilizado y comprometido con la atenci n de las personas con vih tenemos una pol tica de respeto a los derechos humanos y a combatir la discriminaci n como uno de los derechos fundamentales pero nos queda mucho por hacer ya que nuestra ciudad es la que tiene m s infectados de vih
8401310 no tenemos casos de ni os que nacieron con vih porque est sirviendo la detecci n temprana de esta enfermedad en la madre embarazada
8401311 no perdemos oportunidad de pedir los tests del vih a las personas porque sabemos que hay muchos que no saben su status en el pa s tenemos unas 33 000 infectadas de vih

8401319 the doctrine of divine spiration inspiration is the affirmation that at certain times and in certain places god the holy spirit caused men to write books and his supervisory action was such that although these books are truly the work of human beings they are also the word of god the church under the guidance of the holy spirit ultimately came to recognize that there are sixty six books that god caused to be written in this way over a long period of time

8401333 i think the fact that this came in at the last minute it was vetoed by the governor on the very last day he possibly could have done it i think the members of the boating industry and those of us that live on the coast are concerned about tourism we just wanted to be done with it

8401336 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8401337 i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment we have in canada would be unlikely
8401338 it certainly will give whoever wins that election hopefully ourselves that mandate to proceed and to proceed quite aggressively for some period of time
8401339 its important if possible to verify my analysis with the other opposition leaders if theres an election i think its important to give all the parties a chance to prepare

8401378 thats not possible given the current uncertainty in the energy sector
8401379 average people paying 4 at the pump were saying ok whats the plan and there wasnt a plan
8401380 in an environment in which frankly the american public and the american electorate continues to be a lot more concerned about energy prices than about climate change that is a losing proposition
8401381 those people in my life i love as friends very much and those people i dont know that well yet but who i want to become closer friends with
8401382 obviously the war is a very important issue to me we need to get our troops home and we need to get them home now my own personal feelings about it is when the world is kind of perfect and we have those two things when were at peace and everybody has a good job although we should be working on these at the same time i dont mean to imply otherwise im really a big advocate for health care and of course my heart lies with education
8401383 i was kind of afraid of obama the first time i saw him
8401384 he inspires us to be the best americans we can be and i think if hes president when hes president i should say were going to find people changing on the inside and once we all have hope for the future i think youre going to find everyones going to wake up and take control of this amazing moment where theres so many things that need help and people will all be inspired to help
8401385 i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama i want you to be the president i want you in the white house
8401386 this partnership underscores tivos goal of providing easy solutions that bring together television viewing with an individuals lifestyle
8401387 we are working with television advertisers advertising agencies television networks and cable operators to solve the issues that come with commercial avoidance when compared to last years second quarter approximately 50 percent more advertisers utilized tivo this year
8401388 the application of this approach to the increased use of product placements as an advertising tool is also a very promising one
8401389 the industry is a very happy place i am working with some very interesting directors and co stars life just couldnt have gotten better
8401390 because i didnt get the girl in my first movie god decided to be good to me and give me three girls in my second
8401391 minissha is a very sweet grounded and fun loving girl bipasha on the other hand is someone i was in awe of she was such a big star before i did the movie and now shes a friend and yes shes a hottie im sure shell stay the way she is even when she turns 50
8401392 deepika well what can i say she is an extremely talented hard working amazingly beautiful girl im so very proud of her at the age of 22 she has achieved what not a lot of 22 year olds can and im sure she is going to be one of the finest actresses of indian cinema very soon she is an amazing person very simple and very elegant anyone would get attracted to all this dont you think so
8401393 its become bothersome and irritating to just keep answering questions about our love life
8401394 were new in the industry and trying to find our feet wed prefer to be written about for the work we do rather than our personal life i hope with our work the focus shifts to our professional life we thought that being open about our relationship would put an end to gossip but now everyone expects us to talk about that and nothing else
8401395 i do not think there is much of anything unique in commercial hindi cinema
8401396 should we listen to these wise figures who see the world in black and white or should we continue dialogue without discrimination even sitting down at the same table as al qaeda leader osama bin laden
8401397 the only force we have ever had is that of words
8401398 we talked to hamas and hizbullah and other islamist organizations we talked to the most diverse groups in kosovo because they clearly expressed the legitimate interests of the population
8401399 by doing this we did not legitimize their methods but pushed them towards ending violence

8401411 no the goals have not been met they were not well thought out goals anyway and were set too high to achieve and although a lot of blacks have moved upward in the employment ranks and are earning huge salaries they are not efficient or effective in their posts as they were given their positions because of their colour not their skills

8401417 i want to thank defenders of wildlife action fund supporters for their help in this hard fought campaign
8401418 we faced an approximately 750 000 campaign from our opponents including safari club international and a 400 000 state funded campaign approved by governor sarah palin and the alaska legislature
8401419 but thanks to the generous support of defenders of wildlife action fund activists and donors we were able to reach thousands of voters yesterday over 75 000 alaskans voted to end this barbaric practice
8401420 despite this loss were not giving up alaskans for wildlife will continue to hold the state board of games feet to the fire and redouble our efforts to end this brutal program
8401421 you love to be the attacker like the lion catching the gazelle

8401423 in key states during the electioneering communication blackout period 60
8401424 willing to do the work to have an impact on american catholic life and american society
8401425 the very heavy irish influence in shaping the american church over the past 150 years has obviously been based in the demographic realities the irish were the largest single catholic ethnic group in the country but the really interesting thing is this their actual influence was even greater than their numbers
8401426 its because unlike all the other ethnic groups that came to america the irish developed a highly organized and effective leadership the irish with their own priests and religious created an extraordinary cultural system that impacted not only the organization of the catholic church in the united states but also the whole political and social environment in essence the irish turned a persecuted minority into a cultural economic and religious force in the united states
8401427 today latinos are by far the largest catholic ethnic group in the country
8401428 what the church really needs is a generation of latino leaders willing to do the work to have an impact on american catholic life and american society we need leaders willing to vigorously promote priestly vocations and pastoral ministers we need leaders eager to show by their example that success in the financial political or social environment can be achieved by reaffirming not relinquishing their catholic values we need leaders willing to strengthen the latino family as the domestic church which is the cornerstone of a renewal of american culture
8401429 and if you lead if you accept gods call then the future will be full of hope not only for the latino community but for everyone who shares this great and beautiful nation
8401430 we all want to move beyond this culture of secularism materialism and selfishness with all its empty promises false freedoms and false roads to happiness but in order to do that our country needs to be evangelized again
8401431 your mission my friends what the church expects what the nation expects and what god requires is that you become men and women of virtue
8401432 so when i say you must be men and women of virtue im saying that you must be saints
8401433 the goal of the life of virtue is to become like god
8401434 ambassadors of faith heralds of hope and messengers of love
8401435 private prayer and personal devotion your faith must illuminate everything you do from how you love your spouses and raise your children to how you run your businesses to the kind of policies and politicians you support
8401436 god still has something to say to this world that he created this world he shed his own blood to redeem and he wants to make his appeal to the world through you through the witness of your life
8401437 have accepted the lie that they dont need god to be happy
8401438 they put their hope in things that cant last they seek happiness in pleasures that will never satisfy so many of them are like broken cups desperately trying to fill themselves up but never being able to
8401439 about heaven and eternal life pray that the star of christian hope will rise in the hearts of all our neighbors
8401440 jesus taught us that love means laying down your life for your brothers and sisters for you laying down your life might mean risking your reputation your job your re election but we have the promise of our lord that if we lose our lives for the sake of his gospel we will find our lives forever in him
8401441 you may be the only christians your neighbors and co workers come in contact with on a regular basis this is a great responsibility and a great opportunity he emphasized
8401442 you cant read the bible to them or recite the catechism only a changed life will change lives so what you must do is show them a life transformed by the gospel you must be men and women of virtue ambassadors of faith heralds of hope messengers of love
8401443 our nation is waiting for your witness this new evangelization that proceeds from heart to heart from soul to soul an evangelization that once again opens our culture to the saving power of jesus christ
8401444 if we can do it with issues like jobs and health care we can do it on abortion
8401445 out there adopting babies and giving encouragement along those avenues
8401446 what kind of a choice is it if you are afraid on the one hand of terminating a pregnancy or being poor not being able to educate yourself not being able to have health care and not being able to have your kids grow and thrive
8401447 between the two candidates i think senator obama is closer to the churchs teaching than senator mccain is
8401448 we need to talk about the lives lost in iraq war
8401449 when you compare the 4 000 soldiers who lost their lives fighting valiantly in iraq to the 4 000 babies who died today it becomes clear barack obama has admirable qualities but he advocates legal abortion for all nine months
8401450 affordable family planning for comprehensive sex education and for a womans right to choose
8401451 he will be a president who supports womens health and rights one hundred percent hes the change america needs
8401452 if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8401453 john mccain believes that judges politicians and bureaucrats know better than women themselves whats best for their health care
8401454 for mom for lily and for all women barack obama is the right choice
8401455 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8401456 like many other citizens of this nation i was shocked to learn that the speaker of the house of representatives of the united states of america would make the kind of statements that were made to mr tom brokaw of nbc tv on sunday august 24 2008
8401457 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8401458 marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8401459 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any faith
8401460 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8401461 nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8401462 the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8401463 the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8401464 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8401465 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8401466 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8401467 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8401468 pushing our party and our country to achieve equality for all americans
8401469 i look forward to the day when transgendered persons will have basic civil rights in school home and health care
8401470 the radical right is scared to hell about people in this room they will fight tooth and nail to keep what they have
8401471 there is not a single case in the whole world of a baby boy surviving under these circumstances
8401472 when a baby is born prematurely usually he displays mental retardation or blindness as a consequence of the cerebral alterations that are experienced when the process of development is not completed the levels of potassium and glucose are altered there can be infection that raises the blood temperature in summary there are many things against the baby that lead to disabilities
8401473 this little boy is a miracle after so little hope that we had for him this situation is an example of the great strength a baby can have and of everything that painstaking medical care can accomplish
8401474 are there not other more serious injustices that need to be addressed
8401475 it would not be strange in this context to see an assault on the civil code in order to change the definition of marriage and therefore of the family founded upon it
8401476 during the 1920s in the context of a culture of eugenics in which the fear was that the child of a deficient woman would be born deficient
8401477 today we know this is not the case at least not necessarily and to want to extend that absolutist excuse to every kind of rape as if it were a right is a very grave thing
8401478 the defense of the newly conceived human being should be accompanied by the defense of the dignity of women respect for the right to life is at the heart of authentic democracy and the true rule of law
8401479 the respect for human life from conception to natural death
8401480 no situation no matter how unique justifies harming the dignity of persons especially of those who are most vulnerable marginalized or defenseless
8401481 when a society debates the legalization of abortion what is really being discussed is the future of the nation
8401482 recognizing and respecting the right to life is at the heart of authentic democracy and the true rule of law
8401483 as citizens we trust that the justices will carry out their work with responsibility we hope their decision will be guided by justice law truth and the common good
8401484 our church not only applauds but will do everything possible to support the national accord against organized violence
8401485 to me it is a contradiction to sign an accord against violence with great fanfare while at the same time we are threatened with the violence against the most innocent those in the wombs of their mothers being declared constitutional
8401486 fundamentalist violence and hatred will not make the church renounce dialogue since there is no lack of enthusiasm among us for manifesting the love of god everywhere especially for the poor
8401487 in orissa the violence has gotten worse since last december at the end of january we had begun reconstruction of what was destroyed by the violence of radical hindus now we will do the same without fear the wounded and the suffering of the victims will lead us to continue on in our service to them
8401488 are minority groups the reality in india is not that of the violence of these days there is a coexistence and a dialogue among communities that is made manifest in daily life i am convinced that like in the past the hindu representatives and those of other confessions present in india will be the ones to contribute to the reconstruction of what was destroyed

8401504 such carbon equalisation measures could take the form of either a carbon tax or of requiring producers in the exporting countries to purchase international reserve allowances to sell their products in the eu or us both of which effectively raise the price of imported goods to the level of similar goods produced by cleaner technologies at home
8401505 what can be done to break the cycle of complaints and countering these complaints between citizens of woodstock and our elected board members who wish to defend the practices of the town
8401506 how do you satisfy irrational beliefs and vengeance no matter what the boe does just about anything the boe puts forth will be twisted and used against them in some irrational way a few years ago it was cafeteriagate insurancegate and absenteegate computergate was an example last year and the new lawnmowergate is the current issue the reality is that roughly 3 4 of property taxes support the school system in woodstock under state mandate besides the avengers above there is a group of taxpayers who simply do not want to support the school system instead of simply saying this they latch on to the irrational beliefs of others to try to get their way
8401507 and a proxy server warning the boe not to publish news releases at the cafe which was an attempt to convey information to the public
8401508 in the state and perhaps the world behind these two groups are people pursuing personal interests and people common to every town who just dont want to pay taxes for something they dont use

8401521 i think he and obama have talked more in this week than they have talked in their entire lifetimes
8401522 when you have things like this it gets pretty rough and theres a healing process but my sense is the healing process is accelerating
8401523 it would be folly for anybody to believe you go through something like this and when the day is over you just brush yourself off and shake hands
8401524 my sense is wisely that sen obama is going to have both sen clinton and president clinton do events with him
8401525 this is going to be a much warmer thing than you had with reagan and ford its going to be a much warmer thing than you had with kennedy and carter
8401526 i remember having a torrid love affair with stone when linotype commissioned the whole enchilada the eventual divorce was messy we stay in touch its still in my font list but i only use it transitionally whilst attempting to figure out what im trying to do

8401528 classic definition of knuckle heads not that they couldnt be dangerous mind you the embarrassment for the denver pd is that they hadnt swept these mooks up sooner
8401529 i think were of the same mind on that one the most we can hope for is a few bones as you say health care a tax cut on the middle class maybe some reform and protection of public education etc
8401530 im not disputing the facts just pointing out theres similar inconvenient facts regarding mccain and romney
8401531 perhaps my reaction is mainly a knee jerk one but i hope to zeus that i never start thinking of my marriage as an institution to be modeled after a corporation

8401554 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalized entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8401555 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8401556 at times there are terrible programs in say britain or spain but at least viewers have a richer variety of shows to choose from
8401557 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8401558 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8401559 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8401560 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8401561 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline

8401563 hello detroit hello world hire these guys they should be designing our next generation of street vehicles now
8401564 we were hoping they would find in our favor but i think its the reinstatement committee that we really need to talk to
8401565 the staff pretty much did what it has done in the past in this case but the reinstatement committee has the authority to make its own decision so thats where our hope lies
8401566 that was tough on ben to be told it was denied then no wait then to be denied again was a terrible experience
8401567 well defined engineering challenge and a problem susceptible to having huge bales of money thrown at it
8401568 were talking about a very serious issue here that also has huge economic implications
8401569 unfortunately we have no policy framework and there are so many agencies involved with very little co ordination between them blame must be shared equally at the institutional level the engineering level and the consumer level
8401570 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
8401571 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about fuel efficiency and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8401572 we do believe the need for training is becoming increasingly relevant due to the increase in vehicle volumes high speed roads enhanced performance of vehicles and the requirement of specific skills for application vehicles
8401573 as more cars are sold there is a demand for more drivers transporters also want drivers for commercial vehicles where the need for training is perhaps most acute

8401579 good news for the very patient people of the gaspereau valley
8401580 no more adventures trying to cross the busy 101 highway
8401581 are currently doing the planning and design work necessary to prepare this section of highway for construction tender readiness
8401582 i would like to clarify that the project limits will be from the existing twinning at hortonville to just west of the cornwallis river 1 5 km west of exit 14 at coldbrook a distance of 27 5 km
8401583 and staff estimate it wont be ready for construction for a number of years as the construction will take an additional four to five years the completion of this section will not be possible by 2012
8401584 the upgrading of highway 101 continues to be one of our key priorities
8401585 however even with increased federal funding the timelines required to prepare for projects of this size remain substantial
8401586 which should help alleviate some of the congestion on commercial street
8401587 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i am so lucky to have known her loved her and been her partner in all things
8401588 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8401589 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8401590 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant
8401591 her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years
8401592 in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8401593 no secret anymore the times of del martin and phyllis lyon
8401594 if we had a secret we would have written a book and made a million dollars
8401595 we love each other we have similar interests our lives were very similar even before we met
8401596 i think today marriage as an institution has been strengthened
8401597 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men

8401614 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8401615 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8401616 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8401617 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8401618 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base
8401619 i have written quality articles and carefully key worded them why are they not working
8401620 i have written quality articles and carefully key worded them why are they not working
8401621 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8401622 speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion usccb
8401623 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8401624 the fact that these other bishops have joined in shows how bad things are its a sign that a line has been drawn that there will be no nuanced positions on abortion accepted
8401625 no way in life that aquinas would have accepted abortion
8401626 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8401627 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation saint augustine on exodus 21 22
8401628 if men fight and hurt a woman with child so that she gives birth prematurely yet no harm follows he shall surely be punished accordingly as the womans husband imposes on him and he shall pay as the judges determine
8401629 just another snooty tailed liberal that wants to impose her view on the rest of the world
8401630 in these two points pelosi made a factual error concerning the church and an historical error involving one of the great minds of christian philosophy
8401631 another snooty tailed liberal that wants to impose her view on the rest of the world
8401632 stump emphasizes that intellectual powerhouses like augustine and especially aquinas are so incredible they could debate their own arguments their writings encompass volumes of ideas and thoughts taking one of their statements and making it support a controversial political position is well like obama said above our pay grade
8401633 the speaker spew it nancy pelosi and the catholic church on abortion
8401634 if you want to be assured of getting a seat you should buy your all session ticket now
8401635 we will have diverted all that money to address the least likely threat while the real threats come into this country in the hold of a ship or the belly of a plane or are smuggled into a city in the middle of the night in a vial in a backpack
8401636 why can george w bush think of nothing but a missile shield our president is caught in the grip of an obsession worthy of literature
8401637 major terrorist attack against united states interest either here or abroad perhaps with a weapon designed to produce mass casualties
8401638 george bush stood on that aircraft carrier and he declared next stop bagdad
8401639 and yes folks it resonated for all the women who have seen the younger guy come along and get the promotion even though she has worked in the company loyally for years
8401640 here will always be my problem hillary was so obviously the right candidate at the right time why is the woman not right

8401647 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better
8401648 thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hired 200 more inspectors with more to come in this fiscal year
8401649 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running to oversee the production process
8401650 while others characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important part of an effective inspection system the review of results from testing records and cooking temperature employed in a plant are fundamental that the processes employed by the plant are in control
8401651 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8401652 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8401653 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it

8401679 there was nothing he had with him that we have been able to rationalize away and say these are acceptable items in the place he was at

8401688 commit to a project to build a chip fabrication plant
8401689 it was such big news for the region it got built up a little bit and people made a natural assumption that this means that were building a new fab
8401690 when in reality all that was really announced in 2006 was that we had this option to build a fab
8401691 this is about their books and their finances more than their operations
8401692 its about getting rid of the capital requirements for manufacturing
8401693 when the new york deal was done in 2006 amd was well on its way to ascendancy in terms of market share
8401694 the belief was that two current generation fabs would be necessary to satisfy full demand if they got to the 30 percent goal share of the x86 architecture chip market but theyre not at the goal theyre roughly in the 20 percent range
8401695 there may be some issues with amd having to retain controlling ownership in order to be ok with patent licensing agreement with intel
8401696 probably end up with some entity thats halfway between amd and some other concern with a very interestingly structured contract built around it
8401697 the whole reason for asset smart was that the fabs that they owned were a drag on their finances add another plant on top of that that would not be the most prudent thing

8401709 its not a good thing but again i think montas showed over the course of his short career his toughness and ability a lot of times to take some tough situations and make the best of them
8401710 this training camp was going to be an important part for his development no question its going to be pushed back obviously and weve just got to deal with that we dont think its a season ending injury but the time frame as we all know it fluctuates with various injuries

8401716 journalists are open to anybody that helps them and if you can give a journalist a lot of help that journalist will remember that and then when you need help there is a real quid pro quo that goes on there
8401717 mr bush did not consent to undergo this surgical procedure
8401718 in fact mr bush expressly told the physician defendant dr david parkus to refrain from touching him and verbally prohibited dr parkus from performing the surgery on oct 29 2006 and without mr bushs consent dr parkus performed an invasive surgical procedure on mr bush in an attempt to remove the bullet
8401719 only an individual contractor and therefore christus is not responsible for vicarious liability
8401720 the claims of which plaintiff complains were in no way caused by or brought on by any alleged act committed by the defendant
8401721 rather such claims are due solely if at all to the acts of third parties for whose conduct defendant is not liable or responsible
8401722 any injuries suffered by the plaintiff were the result of the comparative negligence of the plaintiff
8401723 invasive surgical procedure on plaintiffs person was intentional reckless extreme and outrageous
8401724 severe emotional distress which cannot be remedied by any other cause of action
8401725 during the hearing the trial court also heard testimony regarding the parties negotiations over a new lease that contradicted the teates claim that parkdale had refused to negotiate with them
8401726 an exhibit offered by the teates demonstrated that on sept 13 2006 parkdale had proposed to renew the lease for a five year term cynthia returned the proposal and asked for a two year term parkdale subsequently leased the space to a new tenant at a significantly higher rental than the amount it proposed to the teates
8401727 on may 21 2007 parkdale filed a motion for sanctions and requested that the trial court dismiss all of the teates claims
8401728 the teates filed no response the trial court subsequently granted parkdales motion for sanctions and ordered that robert and cynthia take nothing on their claims against parkdale and cbl
8401729 we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion and affirm the judgment
8401730 the individuals who violated the courts order to appear for their depositions are the persons suffering the consequences for doing so
8401731 for people for whom faith does inform their values it was welcome
8401732 commit to a project to build a chip fabrication plant
8401733 it was such big news for the region it got built up a little bit and people made a natural assumption that this means that were building a new fab
8401734 when in reality all that was really announced in 2006 was that we had this option to build a fab
8401735 this is about their books and their finances more than their operations
8401736 its about getting rid of the capital requirements for manufacturing
8401737 when the new york deal was done in 2006 amd was well on its way to ascendancy in terms of market share
8401738 the belief was that two current generation fabs would be necessary to satisfy full demand if they got to the 30 percent goal share of the x86 architecture chip market but theyre not at the goal theyre roughly in the 20 percent range
8401739 there may be some issues with amd having to retain controlling ownership in order to be ok with patent licensing agreement with intel
8401740 probably end up with some entity thats halfway between amd and some other concern with a very interestingly structured contract built around it
8401741 the whole reason for asset smart was that the fabs that they owned were a drag on their finances add another plant on top of that that would not be the most prudent thing

8401749 when did making your own jam become a privilege of the elite up until 1950 really a sign of poverty was making your own jam growing your own garden and people strove to become part of the middle class by rejecting that
8401750 looking at that presumption that this is an elitist movement i think america has been bamboozled into thinking that fasts food is the food of the masses
8401751 we need to push back against that notion that fast food is american food

8401778 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
8401779 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
8401780 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

8401784 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

8401830 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers

8401834 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8401835 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8401836 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8401837 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8401838 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8401845 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8401846 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8401847 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
8401848 it certainly is in violation of its commitments to the six party framework certainly in violation of the principle of action for action
8401849 this sudden move was not entirely unexpectable as the us has irked north korea by delaying the removal of north korea from the list of terrorism sponsoring states and south korea and the us did the joint military drill which was seen as a threat to the north
8401850 i do not believe that north korea whole heartedly said they will go back to the starting point in terms of denuclearization process i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the us to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible

8401873 we are thrilled to be working with such a strong brand like tampico
8401874 our goal for this campaign is to engage moms and allow them to feel good about buying tampico for the entire family not only did we need to communicate the variety of flavors but also the unique packaging that tampico offers there is virtually a size for every family member and occasion
8401875 although wholesale gas prices forecasted for this winter have come down in the past few weeks we are still looking at significantly higher prices when compared with last winter

8401900 noncurrent loans are still rising sharply the amount of noncurrent loans and leases 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status increased by 26 7 billion 20 percent during the second quarter following a 26 2 billion increase in the first quarter and a 27 0 billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 almost 90 percent of the increase in noncurrent loans and leases in the last three quarters consisted of real estate loans but noncurrent levels have been rising in all major loan categories at the end of june 2 04 percent of all loans and leases were noncurrent the highest level for the industry since 1993
8401901 the fdics deposit insurance fund reserve ratio fell due to a significant increase in loss reserves including reserves for failures that have occurred since june 30th the dif balance fell to 45 2 billion at the end of the second quarter down from 52 8 billion at the end of the first quarter while insured deposits rose only 0 5 percent during the quarter the decline in the fund balance caused the reserve ratio to fall to 1 01 percent as of june 30th from 1 19 percent one quarter earlier because the reserve ratio is now below 1 15 percent the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 requires the fdic to develop a restoration plan that will raise the reserve ratio to no less than 1 15 percent within five years
8401902 so about that 45 2 billion i had mentioned before

8401920 tomorrow in his speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination you are going to hear sen barack obama talk about voter registration and hes going to mention some numbers that were going to be spending on voter registration through the month of september that will be mind boggling thats going to be a focus of his speech at invesco
8401921 but were doing it in house were doing it with our own volunteers with our own staff
8401922 the numbers are already showing what were doing in virginia what were doing in new mexico what were doing in colorado and nevada its amazing
8401923 i believe the only way barack obama can win is we have to play in states we normally as democrats never played in and we have to bring new people in
8401924 le chain avoir le caravane pass the dog may bark but the caravan keeps passing president mugabe ignored the hecklers and continued laying the legislative agenda as if the hecklers were not there
8401925 so uhm i want to tell you about the uhm new features of our product
8401926 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better
8401927 thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hired 200 more inspectors with more to come in this fiscal year
8401928 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running to oversee the production process
8401929 while others characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important part of an effective inspection system the review of results from testing records and cooking temperature employed in a plant are fundamental that the processes employed by the plant are in control
8401930 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8401931 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8401932 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it
8401933 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hiring 200 more inspectors
8401934 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
8401935 i absolutely do not believe this is a failure of the canadian food safety system or the regulators
8401936 certainly knowing there is a desire to assign blame i want to reiterate that the buck stops here
8401937 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or canadian food safety system
8401938 cfia inspectors are on site every time the plant is operational they are in the plant they are there physically i understand every time the plant is running
8401939 the inspectors that are part of our union have expressed a concern that its simply keeping them too much off the facility floor where they used to actually get a chance to walk around and get a better feel for things
8401940 theyve introduced basically a documentation system that better tracks what activities take place both by the plant and by our members who inspect for the cfia
8401941 the system is supposed to make it more regimented make sure that everything happens in a particular fashion and from that perspective it would be good
8401942 added workload in terms of the documentation certainly doesnt have them feeling really comfortable about the amount of time they get to spend looking at things like sanitation and observing clean up procedures
8401943 because listeria is so widespread in our environment that root cause for certain is unlikely but they continue to seek it out at least to narrow it down
8401944 uma decis o para que a variglog se abstenha de vender a varig do m xico segundo a peticionante um ativo das empresas em recupera o
8401945 de todos os absurdos este foi o maior ceder um ativo que vale us 25 milh es

8401948 we were fighting the church the couch and the courts
8401949 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it
8401950 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men
8401951 self acceptance and a good sense of my own self worth

8401954 my first priority is the state of louisiana and certainly if the storm continues to come our way ill be changing my travel plans
8401955 it was a big game for us and the response was clear
8401956 there was togetherness and focus that is what we wanted after a result like saturday
8401957 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8401958 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8401959 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8401960 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8401961 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8401962 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8401963 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8401964 we found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children
8401965 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8401966 the presence of the international community in afghanistan should be re regulated based on bilateral agreements
8401967 air strikes on civilian targets unilateral searches of homes and illegal detentions must be stopped immediately
8401968 ill be having a book sale and signing of the grey cup edition of rider pride on the american side on saturday august 30 from 1 3 pm at the saskatchewan sports hall of fame and museum 2205 victoria ave in downtown regina the hall is located just west of the hotel saskatchewan anyone purchasing a book will be entered in a draw for autographed cfl memorabilia learn more about the book or purchase a copy by mail at www northernroadpress com get free shipping as a labour day classic special
8401969 we are very excited that myles and his family have committed to the regina pats and the whl in his short time here we have found him to be a mature and respectful young man and when you combine that with his tremendous skill set he has all of the tools to be an impact player in our league
8401970 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8401971 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8401972 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8401973 our vehicles seemed to go largely unnoticed as there was much construction and rebuilding taking place
8401974 women were exactly where men political leaders wanted them bound gagged divided and delivered to the republican and democratic parties
8401975 still have all the abiding inequities that hillary clinton especially in defeat symbolized
8401976 women who would vote for mccain are voting against their own best interests theyre thinking with their ovaries and not their brains
8401977 im 70 years old and i will never see a woman president of my country
8401978 in a strange coincidence to earths last eden good vs evil emerges as a major theme this season i think the audience will quickly identify with one group or the other
8401979 shooting in hd is like adding another character to the show the detail is so sharp you cant help but feel as though you are experiencing the adventure yourself
8401980 todav a no se sabe de qu depende que florezca o no
8401981 una especie de f brica qu mica que hace lo que le apetece
8401982 la reproducci n de esta especie en jardines bot nicos es importante ya que se encuentra amenazada por los incendios forestales y las talas de la selva indonesia
8401983 do we want to give the image of the tattooed person dancing on the table
8401984 dancing on the bar youre taking away their freedom of expression shepard said
8401985 lastly godaddy is or was in bed with the following companies cisco dell microsoft symantec if you want to count them for antivirus solution
8401986 remember the issue with safari where it wouldnt redirect it was some sort of cisco hardware causing the issue that was put into place for anti ddos attacks
8401987 and have come to find that as a gd employee for 9 months i could be considered a
8401988 i highly agree that the qualifications of the individual dont matter when getting a new position
8401989 heather slezak is the biggest waste of space there is she has to work at godaddy because there isnt anywhere else that would take her
8401990 if you want to take godaddys side thats fine but this is not the forum to do so
8401991 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
8401992 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8401993 if somebody comes in and they manufacture a name thats the primary weakness in the system
8401994 every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs
8401995 its important to realize that people want to point fingers at the immigrants but the businesses are taking advantage of that situation
8401996 if we can put a stop to that then the immigrants wouldnt come here anymore
8401997 bam vroeg drie jaar geleden om die brug en een tunnel onder de schelde uit te tekenen
8401998 dus houden wij ons daaraan had de opdrachtgever een brug over de schelde gevraagd hadden we die ook kunnen uittekenen quod non let op die plannen zijn geen werkje voor een ingenieur of twee liefst 30 miljoen euro aan manuren hebben we er al ingestoken dat bedrag willen we terugverdienen wat dacht u voor alle duidelijkheid de oosterweelverbinding is voor ons nog steeds een operationeel dossier geen juridisch we zijn uiteindelijk de preferred bidder het is voor ons een verworven contract dat nog gefinaliseerd moet worden
8401999 maar het is duidelijk dat er werk aan de winkel is zeker wat de voorlichting van alle betrokken partijen betreft priv overheid gebruikers en burgers in het algemeen
8402000 de bedrijfscashflow in die niche is laag zon 2 procent
8402001 er zijn gewoon te veel spelers op de markt meer dan waar ook in europa bij elke bouwproject lopen we elkaar voor de voeten ook kleine kmotjes klitten samen voor grote werken onlangs waren er in brussel veertien gegadigden voor een werk van 50 miljoen euro
8402002 in mijn vijf jaar als ceo was er geen enkel ernstig geschil met klanten en ik wil dat zo houden
8402003 ons imago is wat dat betreft trouwens bijgestuurd tegenover vroeger ik stuur geen advocaten op klanten af
8402004 collega dirk cordeel is een uitstekende professional die ik inderdaad apprecieer
8402005 simpel neen want het is naar eigen zeggen niet te koop
8402006 er noteren geen vergelijkbare bouwmaatschappijen op de brusselse beurs dus is het onmogelijk iets zinnigs te zeggen over de waarde van het aandeel misschien enkel dit toen ik hier aantrad werd de waarde van cfe berekend aan de hand van de formule de waarde van deme min de bouwactiviteiten nu tellen de analisten de waarde van die laatste er ten minste als extraatje bij
8402007 er is bovendien veel synergie tussen de bouw en de baggeractiviteiten zeker voor de grote infrastructuurwerken in een pps constructie zoals noriant niet toevallig is onze grootste belgische concurrent jan de nul ook actief als baggeraar n aannemer
8402008 er bestaan daarover perfecte afspraken met avh wij zijn intelligente aandeelhouders die aan de toekomst denken 70 procent van de winst van deme vloeit terug naar het bedrijf in 2008 zal dat zelfs 75 procent zijn
8402009 de ontwikkeling van gebouwen levert meer rendement op dan het optrekken ervan
8402010 anderzijds cre ert die poot ook omzet bij de andere divisies hij werkt eigenlijk als een buffer om schommelingen op te vangen
8402011 ppsen met design build finance amp maintain contracten staan nog in de kinderschoenen
8402012 behalve de werken rond het antwerpse masterplan heb je nog de spoortunnel onder de schelde en brabo het tramtraject rond antwerpen thats it geen enkel project is definitief toegewezen in walloni is er sprake van een kleine pps rond de bouw van de duitstalige scholen maar de overheden kunnen pps best reserveren voor projecten van een zekere omvang er steekt enorm veel studiewerk in en die kosten moeten worden terugverdiend een pps van 20 miljoen euro is eigenlijk de moeite niet waard
8402013 kumpen cordeel denys van roey vanhaerents we komen ze allemaal tegen als concurrent voor ppsen
8402014 geloof toch niet die bewering dat wij de vlaamse kmos platdrukken maar je moet ook ernstig blijven zon oosterweelverbinding weegt echt wel door op je balans dus dat moet je aankunnen we hebben er nog geen eurocent aan verdiend
8402015 neen serieus cfe was al een mooi bedrijf van een bouwbedrijf met sterke baggeractiviteiten werden we een onderneming met heel wat beroepen
8402016 maar onze franse collegas zijn vooral actief op lokale overheidsmarkten terwijl wij internationale groepen bedienen
8402017 ik kan uiteraard niet over suez ooit aandeelhouder van cfe trouwens nvdr spreken onze raad van bestuur neemt na een open debat alle beslissingen unaniem rekening houdend met het belang van cfe we zijn het enige bedrijf uit de sfeer van vinci waar het minder dan 100 procent heeft en het respecteert het belgische karakter
8402018 de voorbije jaren heeft bent geat dat imago proberen bij te sturen grotendeels met succes
8402019 maar het is een permanente opdracht de positie in vlaanderen is zeker na de volledige integratie van van wellen in 2005 heel wat sterker geworden
8402020 maar ik heb er het talent niet voor begrijpen doe ik het wel zoek er asjeblief geen communautaire strategie achter de raad van bestuur van cfe is goed verdeeld je hebt een waal een brusselaar en twee vlamingen de vier anderen zijn fransen maar dat zijn geen franstaligen
8402021 zonder catastrofes zal dat wel lukken ik leef graag in brussel het enige verschil met de belgen is dat ik in de vakantie naar mijn thuisstad bordeaux trek en niet naar de belgische kust
8402022 were playing a guessing game on what the governor is going to do our constituents need help now
8402023 reallocating funds in the time of crisis is an absolute necessity because we dont want to pile a fiscal disaster on top of a natural disaster
8402024 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8402025 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in the third and i had to come back

8402030 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8402031 no refor o da democracia e na solu o dos problemas por meio do engajamento c vico
8402032 acho que ela fez um discurso muito bom de seu ponto de vista e do nosso mas n o necessariamente do ponto de vista de barack obama
8402033 ela nunca respondeu realmente quest o essencial se ele obama est pronto para ser presidente que foi a quest o que ela lan ou de forma bastante dram tica durante as prim rias
8402034 a senadora hillary fez sua campanha presid ncia deixando claro que barack obama n o est preparado para liderar como comandante em chefe
8402035 em nenhum lugar esta noite ela alterou essa avalia o em nenhum lugar esta noite ela disse que barack obama est pronto para liderar milh es de eleitores de hillary clinton e milh es de americanos continuam preocupados sobre se barack obama est pronto para ser presidente
8402036 essa uma luta pelo futuro e uma luta que precisamos vencer
8402037 bom mas n o t o bom para barack obama em 2008 melhor ainda se as coisas mudarem como parecem para hillary clinton em 2012
8402038 o que faltou foi muito no sentido de uma descri o de barack obama que tipo de homem ele algu m que ap ia as mesmas posi es que ela
8402039 ser que ela olhou fundo em seu cora o e encontrou alguma coisa que valha a pena n o h sinal aqui de que ela tenha feito isso seria ele um bom comandante em chefe nenhuma palavra sobre isso como a campanha de mccain r pida e alegremente observou
8402040 a primeira vez desde 1976 que uma conven o ficava mais entusiasmada com um perdedor do que com um vencedor

8402047 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8402048 weve had a real focus on trying to drive our subscriber acquisition cost numbers down a lot of that is being able to develop better opportunities for third parties to market us
8402049 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8402050 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8402051 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8402052 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8402053 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
8402054 we found out its probably the road noise and the motion
8402055 it didnt have much to do with the engine noise since theres no internal combustion engine
8402056 if a minister embezzles or carries out any act of corruption would you hold the president liable the president is not responsible for a ministers mistake
8402057 as a liberator you are questioning me when you should be happy about my role
8402058 if we had not fought to get charles taylor out of your backs you wouldnt be sitting here today
8402059 purdues administration have a lot to answer with how they treat people unfortunately bullies win until someone stands up to them
8402060 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8402061 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8402062 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8402063 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it
8402064 i dont think we ever hit each other scratching im not going to deny that
8402065 all those people who wrote the i hate brenda newsletter are going to get mad at me now like why are you leaving your child with brenda
8402066 the lawsuit states that the plaintiffs iphones appeared to connect to the 3g network less than 25 percent of the time and that smith and triggs experienced an
8402067 around 150 000 people gathered yesterday from different areas it became tough for us to care for the baby
8402068 we called police to tackle the situation and they are guarding the hospital in jessore as well
8402069 he has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths he has one genital organ and a full set of limbs
8402070 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly
8402071 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8402072 im lucky to have lived through it and im lucky someone came along when they did
8402073 its very disheartning for us to have to call a victim and let them know no its not over we thought it was over but were going to have a reconsideration
8402074 i think just because im lucky shouldnt mean he gets a break
8402075 thats ridiculous i mean i cant even believe he threw that out there
8402076 die polizeidirektion werra mei ner fahndet jetzt mit einem phantombild nach einem der t ter der an den k rperverletzungen in bad sooden allendorf beteiligt war
8402077 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen and assets of problem institutions will continue to rise
8402078 noncurrent loans are still rising sharply the amount of noncurrent loans and leases 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status increased by 26 7 billion 20 percent during the second quarter following a 26 2 billion increase in the first quarter and a 27 0 billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 almost 90 percent of the increase in noncurrent loans and leases in the last three quarters consisted of real estate loans but noncurrent levels have been rising in all major loan categories at the end of june 2 04 percent of all loans and leases were noncurrent the highest level for the industry since 1993
8402079 the fdics deposit insurance fund reserve ratio fell due to a significant increase in loss reserves including reserves for failures that have occurred since june 30th the dif balance fell to 45 2 billion at the end of the second quarter down from 52 8 billion at the end of the first quarter while insured deposits rose only 0 5 percent during the quarter the decline in the fund balance caused the reserve ratio to fall to 1 01 percent as of june 30th from 1 19 percent one quarter earlier because the reserve ratio is now below 1 15 percent the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 requires the fdic to develop a restoration plan that will raise the reserve ratio to no less than 1 15 percent within five years
8402080 so about that 45 2 billion i had mentioned before
8402081 america isnt easy america is advanced citizenship youve gotta want it bad cause its gonna put up a fight
8402082 so what happens when the fdic needs money to cover depositors losses
8402083 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
8402084 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

8402096 de todos os absurdos este foi o maior ceder um ativo que vale us 25 milh es
8402097 tenho de ver o andamento disso no pal cio n o s a mp da pesca mas tem alguns outros itens que temos de ver como resolver
8402098 a viagem para fazer contatos preliminares com as tr s bolsas de l o objetivo mais parceria do que aquisi es
8402099 el tema est politizado ya entonces es complicado establecer exactamente d nde est la verdad pero yo pienso y lo he manifestado as que el aula magna de la cat lica contrario a lo que se diga a veces en m poca al menos diez a os de rector a donde fueron pol ticos etc no fueron ni barras ni se la prest para fines de temas pol ticos
8402100 es una cadena que est reiterada todos los s bados se sabe c mo es la cadena por lo tanto esa cadena no es acad mica es pol tica y pienso que no se debi prestar el aula magna para ese tipo de actos
8402101 pero comenzando por all pienso que no se debi haber hecho este acto ah eso primero
8402102 si la inteligencia policial o militar detect previamente que podr an haber incidentes entonces ten an que haberle mandado una comunicaci n al rector dici ndole en prevenci n de incidentes pedimos a usted que un cuerpo policial vaya a la universidad y entonces podr an haber mandado porque la polic a sabe hacer muy bien las cosas cuando quiere hacerlo
8402103 la inteligencia deb a haberle dicho al presidente de la rep blica va a haber tal cosa o va a haber tal otra cosa vaya en estas condiciones hay que preservar la situaci n del presidente de la rep blica
8402104 la polic a en mi opini n no ha estado organizada para un acto acad mico la polic a ha ido ah ya a ver o la mandaron ya porque sab an que iba a pasar algo o fue ya cuando estaba armada media gresca all y estaba a dos cuadras de distancia pero el presidente de la rep blica sale del aula magna y baja sale de la universidad por la v a de subida que solo es de subida es decir la polic a no saca al presidente por la v a normal de salida sino que lo saca en medio de todo el bullicio y de todo lo que pasaba entonces el presidente sale como corriendo de la universidad cat lica y est n en las fotos y los videos diciendo que hay una manta blindada esa manta que cubre a veces que yo dec a el d a que me la tiren encima me mata la manta porque me rompe la columna
8402105 aqu de lo que se trata es de lo siguiente yo soy universitario de toda la vida la izquierda ecuatoriana ha hecho las manifestaciones en contra de los presidentes a donde estos presidentes se encuentren lo que pasa es que ahora como que la tortilla se ha virado debido a que en este caso quienes protestan son del sector de la derecha pol tica ecuatoriana y entonces hay que ponerle nombre y apellido a cada delincuente porque ah hab an montones de personas decenas de decenas de personas seg n los videos entonces escogen nombres bonitos como para carg rselos encima
8402106 yo creo que todo esto desprestigia a nuestro pa s porque no se busca la verdad tenemos que buscar la verdad en cada caso y en cada momento de nuestra vida
8402107 como se ha polarizado tanto la situaci n yo creo que esto va a quedar el fiscal puede levantar juicios etc etc todos hemos sido universitarios todos hemos sido en una u otra forma m s rebeldes y sabemos muy bien que cuando un muchacho de veinte a os le dicen tal cosa contesta con otra igual entonces aqu la universidad cat lica hoy d a leo preocupado que dice que ha habido gente con manopla que ha perseguido etc etc entonces el tema se va agrandando en lugar de buscar la verdad se va buscado culpables en cada grupo
8402108 lo nico que rescato es que los universitarios por fin ahora han dicho aqu estamos porque hace tiempo que estaban dormidos y no hab a una presencia universitaria en el pa s como que estaban yo digo como que si les hubieran puesto una inyecci n de trancalmato
8402109 claro que hay que sancionar cuando hay que sancionar pero en este momento yo he sido presidente de la rep blica y a los dem s presidentes a todos nos han insultado cuando han querido el grupo tal o el grupo tal los que somos m s dem cratas que otros hemos pasado por alto esas situaciones pero aqu querer expulsar alumnos de la universidad a b o c yo creo que esa es la medida m s dr stica porque incluso los pone en peligro de perder sus vidas universitarias en cualquier universidad
8402110 the coach yelled back at them and said you dont ask for a water break ill tell you when you can have one and get back on the field so they went back to practicing
8402111 too much time went by before i think they did get him over to the water
8402112 we have not had any concerns at this point that i know from football parents in particular
8402113 i thought they just kept thinking he would come round i guess

8402129 i was contacted by a woman named claudine who became my trainer as an economic hit man
8402130 she said she was sent to help me and to train me
8402131 she is extremely beautiful sensual seductive intelligent her job was to convince me to become an economic hit man holding out these three drugs sex drugs and money and then she wanted to let me know that i was getting into a dirty business and i shouldnt go off on my first assignment which was going to be indonesia and start doing this unless i knew that i was going to continue doing it and once i was in i was in for life
8402132 the system is set up such that the countries are so deep in debt that they cant repay their debt

8402134 at that first meeting the president of the company mentioned some of the books that i had written about indigenous people and said thats nice thats fine keep doing your non profit work

8402139 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium

8402147 we held a welcome rookie brunch at on saturday so the parents of the new players who were here could come join us
8402148 we had never done this before but with so many new faces and new families to our program we thought that it would be a great idea that received great reviews and it was fun to see players and families interacting
8402149 i have already seen that they are doing a lot of conditioning on their own

8402151 true economy consists in always making the income exceed the outgo wear the old clothes a little longer if necessary dispense with the new pair of gloves mend the old dress live on plainer food if need be so that under all circumstances unless some unforeseen accident occurs there will be a margin in favour of the income a penny here and a dollar there placed on interest goes on accumulating and in this way the desired result is obtained it requires some training perhaps to accomplish this economy but when once used to it you will find there is more satisfaction in rational saving than in irrational spending
8402152 the wise man saves for the future but the foolish man spends whatever he gets

8402180 do you know how much more youre paying for food
8402181 maybe you need to buy a gift for a loved one without ruining the surprise

8402183 the most likely situation is the obvious one nudge nudge wink wink say no more
8402184 the enterprise is more concerned with keeping user information guarded from untrusted web sites than making sure your off business internet habits are kept secret
8402185 the features so far described by microsoft seem to fall more squarely into the paranoid spouse category aka what has been coined porn mode
8402186 if you happen to browse to sites that refer to the same third party resource i e a script image stylesheet information is sent to that third party
8402187 over time the third party can create a profile of which web sites you go to what links you click on etc
8402188 historically microsoft has done a good job of giving enterprise security teams a fair amount of control of applications from within active directory
8402189 essentially if written policy states that all browsing history is kept then more than likely the enterprise will be given the ability to disable the inprivate mode

8402198 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8402199 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8402200 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8402201 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8402202 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8402203 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8402204 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8402205 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8402206 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8402207 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

8402211 ive not made the decision yet but hes a big person in this part of the world and he deserves an opportunity to play in a big game in his final season at the club
8402212 you dont want to miss any big game and it was extra special being the first one at the new wembley so it will be great to take part this year
8402213 our biggest concern is motu tony who had a recurrence of a knee injury
8402214 the grains of sand are falling and motus going to have a job getting onto the training pitch
8402215 the neck is fine and 100 but he has lost a lot of weight hes well underdone in terms of conditioning
8402216 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think he has been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player

8402224 gloria estefan came out and said her manager kept asking her if she wanted to cancel the show and she would look out the bus window at the rain drenched crowd and said if theyre not leaving im not either
8402225 i became a huge fan of gloria estefan that day i will never forget her generosity it was a big deal for a kid in a small town

8402234 the iphone launch has kicked off the process of building a 3g ecosystem that can take off once the 3g services roll out next year

8402236 suddenly you could have these mobile users crossing over to the other side of the digital divide
8402237 we plan to launch three models in above rs 25 000 category by the end of the year omnia will be one of them
8402238 no apologies for that as it is a phone beyond price as a consideration

8402246 provide some encouraging evidence that price pressures in the eurozones largest economy are beginning to recede
8402247 million dollar question is whether the inflation beast is now really tamed or just taking a short breather
8402248 nearly all depends on the oil price in the months to come
8402249 if the price of oil remains at around its current level in the coming months or even falls further the peak of inflation is likely to be behind us for the time being
8402250 an encouraging sign that petrol and heating oil suppliers are passing the fall in the oil price on to consumers very quickly
8402251 it is much too soon to breath a sigh of relief
8402252 early signs of easing price pressures support our view that the bank ecb will be free to start cutting interest rates early next year

8402307 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job

8402313 of course this raises some questions because normally battleships do not deliver aid and if it is a battleship diplomacy or rather battleship humanitarian diplomacy of course it does not make the situation more stable
8402314 but this is the choice of those who deliver aid
8402315 this is like a bullfight in spain when someone sticks a knife in the bull and it is bleeding and people are waiting for the bull to die

8402323 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8402324 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8402325 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8402326 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8402327 this defendant uses the time that he has to think out these plans and he is dangerous
8402328 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8402329 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again

8402399 in reality the only contribution that science can make to the ideas of religion is atheism
8402400 i believe in stupid shit i know isnt true and im embarrassed to tell you exactly what it is
8402401 in reality the only contribution that science can make to the ideas of religion is atheism
8402402 in reality the only contribution that science can make on the ashes of religion is atheism
8402403 in reality the only contribution that science can make from the shit pile of religion is atheism
8402404 if you are a christian you cant think rationally so therefore you cant contribute to anything and you certainly cant be a scientist if you are a scientist you only think rationally therefore you cant believe in religion and you must only operate rationally
8402405 if you are a christian you cant think rationally so therefore you cant contribute to anything and you certainly cant be a scientist if you are a scientist you only think rationally therefore you cant believe in religion and you must only operate rationally
8402406 only contribution science is going to make to religion is atheism
8402407 i cannot possibly explain this therefore it must be evidence of the intervention of the creator
8402408 if you are a christian you cant think rationally so therefore you cant contribute to anything and you certainly cant be a scientist
8402409 its behind everything in a way that cant be examined or thought about too hard
8402410 however we reiterate for the record that the narrative which fails to distinguish between types of believer and instead holds that
8402411 a natural egocentric tendency to see itself as the point purpose focus and basis of the entire cosmos
8402412 image and likeness of the will and intellect of its maker
8402413 the difference between the theist and the evolutionist is this when the theist runs into an exlanatory block they say
8402414 as a young boy i dreamed of being a baseball rationalist but tonight i say we must move forward not backward upward not forward and always twirling twirling twirling towards freedom
8402415 that is the definition of narcissism it is probably the only option open for an atheist the theist sees god as the point purpose focus and basis for the entire cosmos

8402424 even though he did make snail like improvement these past 31 days he is not any better for words and has not had any consistency in the tests that the medical team have done for him
8402425 at this time the hemorrhage has done massive damage to his body which will leave him severely disabled and in need of acute care for the rest of his life we know jerry wouldnt want to live like this in a vegetative state

8402436 i am pleased to assume the position of chairman of the partnership
8402437 in combination with my role as president chief executive officer and chairman of dcp midstream the owner of the partnerships general partner i am invested in the success of the partnership with our recently announced growth projects we remain focused on delivering value to our unitholders

8402440 as markets become more and more global and all other major capital markets have embraced ifrs it is clear that the sec needed to require companies to begin the complex process of converting their books to ifrs at resources we see the benefits of adoption of ifrs as multi dimensional ifrs will better position american companies to access capital in the global marketplace and provide for consistency in financial reporting for the benefit of investors credit rating agencies and others around the globe
8402441 were not big in the line and this gives us a chance by leveling the playing field
8402442 what concerns me today is that our council will most likely vote on this matter at the next council meeting and i think the votes are currently there for passing whatever dollar amount our elected leaders see fit as far as i see this matter itll have at least 3 solid votes for spending in franklin olson sohns and solomon
8402443 until i see an economic impact study with the benefits for the city of franklin i will not vote on this proposal
8402444 someone needs to figure out the benefit increase for each community
8402445 coming to the city of franklin for money at this point i dont think is appropriate oak creek officials havent approached any other players including south milwaukee and milwaukee county to involve them nor have they gone to the dot and fought the case that this is a regional issue

8402447 solace tm windows offer remodelers the opportunity to provide a high quality replacement window solution with the power of one of the most preferred building materials brands and the support needed to drive their business

8402450 runtime cycle life and power are at the beginning of nearly every discussion we have with our customers
8402451 based on what we see in the survey data engineers and designers believe that with the proper cell selection and battery electronics they can create a competitive advantage for their products with a better battery pack
8402452 the design of the electronics in a battery pack that control charge and discharge with elements such as gas gauging is key to improving performance and we can see in the study that the industry is coming to appreciate that
8402453 ensuring that the charge or discharge cycles dont terminate prematurely or that the pack is not abusively charged or over discharged affects both capacity and cycle life
8402454 that cost appeared so low on the priority list for both groups we surveyed and nearly at the bottom among our marketing contacts battery performance clearly is seen as a core competitive advantage by our customers and that should be the primary consideration as we make design decisions on new battery packs for our customers
8402455 safety was seen as the second most important characteristic in selecting the right battery chemistry by engineers and designers right after runtime performance
8402456 safetys been on our customers minds more than ever lately and thats always a big question during our customer meetings they want to know if a change in battery chemistry will affect safety and they dont want to do anything to subject their designs to a potential recall
8402457 there have been many new developments in terms of technology and regulation in the industry of late and the survey responses indicate a broad divergence between those who understand their impact and those who dont
8402458 there are so many different variants of lithium ion cells for instance and not every one fits every application
8402459 some are better suited to high temperature some are ideal for supporting higher discharge rates the key element is to understand all the different cell chemistries available and to select the right one that delivers the longest runtime and overall performance while taking into account the applications other requirements such as size cost and weight
8402460 a thorough understanding of the new lithium battery shipping regulations
8402461 because of our experience in so many different battery technologies in use today rather than just a few specialties we are well positioned to assist our customers in making the right decisions in balancing performance and trade off decisions
8402462 is this genuine multipurpose hatred and hostility or just some post juvenile acting out in the anonymity of the web

8402489 yeah it was a good enough speech but whens the next election
8402490 every single media representative there receives an embargoed copy of the speech
8402491 jason gibbs spokesman for gov jim douglas said the administration is leery of the census numbers given that poverty levels have not increased and per capita income has risen he said one possible explanation for the decline in household income over the two year period is the states aging demographics as more people retire their household income declines he said
8402492 why is it that we exist is for our own atonement for others or for life itself what is our purpose in this universe is it our destiny to be destroyed with this universe and live this life over and over again do we exist for love or do we exist because we or this universe desires it are we here just because we are or for a greater purpose is this our one and only life and what happens after the imminent destruction i like to think that there is more beyond this life and our purpose is to get there and achieve that i like to think that our future isnt set in stone what happens to our collective conscienceness once the universe is gone are we meant to explore the far reaches for all eternity or will we meet somewhere and start all over again we will all meet again somewhere someday but when i just dont know but we will im sure of it

8402494 ghana being a tropical country the effect of climate change can be twofold
8402495 it can result in prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns in which case there can be years of too much rain too much rain than expected or less than expected in certain parts of the country as happened in the northern part of the country last year we had so much rain and flooding that had not been experienced in decades
8402496 the problem with deforestation is largely to blame on the government
8402497 that is the government is not committed to some of the basic rules that it itself has put in place to regulate or to ensure that forest is conserved one is the issue that the government is not able to control what we call the annual allocation of companies in timber processing so because government can not monitor people are always cutting beyond what we call the annual allowable cut

8402519 after that surgery things never got better and actually got worse and worse i threw 20 innings that spring and it was terrible my arm was hurting all the time and i was not having any success so it was real tough the indians drafted me based on past accomplishments and i was lucky enough where they made me a good offer and i signed right after i signed i went to instructs and tried to get things going again but it just wasnt working i had to have another surgery and have four screws put in my shoulder to put my labrum back together so since then it has been good and i have made it through this season pain free and i am having fun and happy to be playing again
8402520 i have been as high as 94 mph this year
8402521 i dont throw consistently as hard as i used to but i sit around 90 91 mph ill take it i am healthy and i am happy with that i have been getting nothing but stronger this year hopefully it continues to build being left handed and sitting around 90 mph is good
8402522 the drop in velocity has helped me learn how to throw strikes more consistently since i have to
8402523 i used to throw from over the top but i cant really throw like that anymore because it doesnt really feel good so i throw from a little bit lower slot and i scrapped a curveball and throw more of a slider now and my changeup has gotten a lot better and has been good for me this year i have a real free and easy motion so the ball looks like it is coming out a lot harder than it really is and i get a lot of swing and misses with my fastball even though i dont throw it as fast as i used to it is probably still my best pitch i have also really learned how to locate my slider well against left handers which i get some swings and misses and strikeouts on too
8402524 i have had some inconsistencies with my delivery which has caused me to have some control issues at times
8402525 some outings i will throw a nine pitch inning and go 1 2 3 and then the next inning i will walk the first two guys it is just some inconsistencies with my delivery that lead to fractions of an inch that can be the difference between throwing a ball or strike it has been getting better i think part of it too is it has been three years now since i have been healthy and i am just trying to get that back there were times when i was pitching but it wasnt for more than two weeks and i had to shut it down because my arm was hurting
8402526 there were plenty of times where i would not have been upset with myself if i just packed it up and went home
8402527 i love playing the game and i am getting paid to play a kids game now that i look back on it i am glad i never did the hardest part was hearing i had to have the second surgery after having the first one i knew it was going to be a process i mean there were some days after that first surgery where i literally felt like my arm was going to fall off my body it was days like that where i questioned if it was even worth it but i am glad i stuck with it
8402528 it is feeling alright and coming along the way it should be
8402529 i am not really going to catch that much maybe a little later on once i get a little stronger i just need to get more comfortable behind the plate arm strength wise to where when i get into a game i am ready to go and feel good
8402530 so i am just taking extra swings when i can with the hitting coach to work on some things the main thing is just getting my arm strength back and arm action back to the proper way throwing down to second they said with only a few games left they dont really want to push it if they dont feel my arm is not 100 back there more or less until they decide i can do it i will pretty much just be dhing
8402531 you just sort of have to keep working with what you got
8402532 just keep focused i think it sort of helps you shoot the biggest thing i have ever had to deal with in baseball is the shoulder once i can get over this hurdle i am not saying nothing is going to ever be easy but it will be nice to put it behind me and maintain it and go from there
8402533 it went from the lat to my muscles deep in my rotator cuff which is what was causing all the inflammation and then went from there all the way down to my triceps muscle
8402534 that was what caused all the problems it was a continuation from spring training that flared up on me again
8402535 it is frustrating because it is hard to get back into it
8402536 i was starting to figure things out just before i got injured and things were starting to come back together then i had this big setback and now it is hard to get back into it this is a critical part of the year now so hopefully i can get it going i definitely want to finish strong and try to raise my average a couple points then go into the offseason and have a good instructs and go from there i just want to have a good offseason and make sure to take care of the shoulder and do my shoulder programs and come in next year ready to have a big year
8402537 it has been disappointing and frustrating to say the least but i am just trying to finish strong if i can ill probably be here for the rest of the time i came here with hopes of just trying to get my legs back under me and hoping to get out of here but i have had some complications still from my previous surgery so i am just going to stick around here and try to play as much as a i can
8402538 i was blessed with a very good season last year and felt great in spring but when i got into the season health wise things just have not worked out for me i had the effort and battled as much as i could anytime you are on the disabled list it is frustrating no matter what it is and unfortunately i was on it a great amount of time it sucks to lose that many at bats but i am just trying to salvage as much as i can right now
8402539 just playing right now is the biggest goal for me
8402540 to keep playing stay in the games stay as healthy as possibly and manage the discomfort with my knee also help this team and make a run for a title
8402541 i actually went to junior college and was a starter but then i had shoulder surgery
8402542 i didnt really bounce back from the surgery and so it was just something i tried out for recovery purposes and ended up sticking with it i was able to bounce back a lot faster
8402543 for me it has always been about command of the fastball
8402544 when i am throwing strikes i am pretty good i struggled early on commanding my fastball and walked some people i didnt have a lot of confidence because the fastball was all over the place but as of late i have felt a lot more comfortable and am commanding it a lot better i definitely have ended the season a lot better than i started i just need to continue building on that and lead myself into next year and do better
8402545 that is what i am struggling with right now is getting lefties out
8402546 i am pretty good against the righties but lefties i am walking guys against righties i am afraid to hit them so i get out in front of it while with lefties i have all that open space on the right side and i dont finish and i dont get it out in front and it sinks into the right handed batters box
8402547 i doubt i will ever go back over the top
8402548 it feels better already so it is not going to be a long term thing i just dont want to push it and re aggravate it right now i am just going to be missing a start and go from there and if it is still bothering me theyll extend that i played catch today thursday real light and it felt okay and i am icing it a lot
8402549 i just wanted to establish the ball down in the zone i feel that in any level from now on if you are up in the zone you are going to get hurt so i just need to establish it down in the zone and establish a second and third pitch i really wanted to get off to a good start and show them what i am capable of and just continue doing that
8402550 the season is almost over and i would like to be healthy for the playoffs but worse case scenario i wont and i shut it down
8402551 i dont see that happening right now but the last thing i want to do is go out too early and damage it or make it worse
8402552 im glad the indians choose me and i hope they are too
8402553 is this movie based on the running with scissors pc game apple sucks
8402554 maybe you know it but its not so easy to finance movies in total and the reason i am able to do these kind of movies is i have a tax shelter fund in germany and if you invest in a movie in germany you get basically fifty percent back from the government

8402574 we the people ordain and establish the constitution and when we the people established the constitution we created congress if we created congress who works for who do we work for congress no congress works for we the people there is a presumption of law that predates the the created can never be higher than the creator since we the people created congress it cannot be more powerful than we are congress would have you believe otherwise though when my daughter used to misbehave badly i would tell her there would never come a day when i could not take her out of this world just as i had brought her into it in this same respect congress was invented by we the people it is our creation if we the people do not like congress we can take them out however being truly free is not for everyone most people arent interested in being free they seem to like the idea of the government telling them what to do and when how much to weigh what to eat whether or not to smoke what is healthy etc while at the same time the government manipulates them by manipulating data and numbers to suit their governments purposes most people do not have the sovereign mentality those of us who stand up for our rights creator given are sovereign individuals with the sovereign mentality we believe that freedom is worth the cost at any price then there is financial sovereignty that is where you get all that you own to be untouchable and protected the government the bad guys who would take your stuff and make it theirs last of all is physical sovereignty you may only be sovereign over a quarter acre but over that quarter acre of ground you hold all the rights and privileges of a king or queen we were there in the beginning of this country and we are struggling to get back there again some people may not want to struggle as hard as they have to in order to gain total sovereignty if we the people are sovereign do we have the authority to violently overthrow the government if necessary in the united states today this is a dangerous question to even ask let alone consider our government labels us extremists radicals possibly even terrorists and yet it is the government which is acting as the terrorist with laws such as fisa irs and the federal reserve bank it is government propaganda which makes us believe that fighting for our creator given rights makes us terrorists give me liberty or give me death

8402651 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8402652 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8402653 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8402654 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8402655 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8402656 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8402657 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8402658 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8402659 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8402660 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8402661 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8402662 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8402663 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8402664 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8402665 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year

8402667 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8402668 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8402669 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8402670 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8402671 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8402672 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8402673 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it

8402675 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8402676 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8402677 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8402678 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8402679 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8402680 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8402681 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8402682 no one works for someone we all just work together
8402683 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8402684 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8402685 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8402686 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8402687 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8402688 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8402689 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8402690 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8402691 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8402692 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8402693 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8402694 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8402695 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8402696 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8402697 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8402698 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8402699 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8402700 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8402701 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8402702 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8402703 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8402704 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

8402710 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8402711 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8402712 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8402713 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8402714 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8402715 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8402716 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8402717 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8402718 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8402719 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8402720 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8402721 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8402722 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8402723 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8402724 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8402725 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8402726 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8402727 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8402728 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

8402735 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8402736 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8402737 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8402738 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8402739 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8402740 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8402741 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8402742 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8402743 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8402744 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8402745 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8402746 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8402747 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8402748 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8402749 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8402750 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8402751 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8402752 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8402753 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8402754 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8402755 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8402756 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8402757 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8402758 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8402759 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8402760 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

8402927 we needed to be organised because they play a little with your patience we were disciplined and focused and we were never really under threat
8402928 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday

8402939 have you eaten dog food for any reason in the last two months
8402940 it used to be that only college students two year olds and the elderly ate dog food but now were apparently seeing more and more people eating it as a meal ill grant you that it is delicious but to me this is an indictment of the entire military industrial complex and the unlawful bush war that has led to people eating first their pets then pet food soon they will be reduced to devouring their shoe leather

8402973 due to a tightening economy and labour market employers plan to award average base pay increases of 3 8 per cent in 2009 slightly less than the four per cent increase granted in 2008
8402974 clearly the uneven economy is having an impact on human capital and compensation strategies
8402975 albertas economy led primarily by the energy and natural resources sectors continues to boom and employers are granting higher pay increases to reflect this growth
8402976 organizations in other areas such as ontario where the manufacturing sector is struggling are facing the challenges of a tightening economy
8402977 over the past year earnings among canadas largest industrial sectors increased by 3 6 per cent in educational services 2 6 per cent in manufacturing 2 5 per cent in health and social assistance 2 1 per cent in accommodation and food services and 1 6 per cent in retail trade
8402978 although these cash based strategies are quite effective in solving immediate needs a more holistic approach to total rewards one that considers base pay variable pay benefits and career development is critical for maintaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace

8402986 it turns out that something very similar to my desert island thought experiment has been performed on chickens by a poultry scientist named william muir
8402987 its sort of become my mission to incorporate this into higher education
8402988 this is a book of tall claims about evolution that it can become uncontroversial that the basic principles are easy to learn that everyone should want to learn them once their implications are understood that evolution and religion those old enemies who currently occupy opposite corners of human thought can be brought harmoniously together
8402989 it really is the case that evolution has become a set of basic principles that really explains life
8402990 as that becomes ever more apparent and ever more powerful then its clear that somethings got to give with respect to our own species tell me exactly why humans are an exception
8402991 all of this could be explained by these very simple principles
8402992 the theory of everything is i think what made evolution so remarkable to begin with
8402993 darwins theory of natural selection is like a recipe with three ingredients we start with
8402994 when the ingredients are combined they lead to a seemingly inevitable outcome as an example imagine a population of moths that vary in their coloration first ingredient some are more easily spotted and eaten by predators removing them from the population second ingredient the offspring of the survivors resemble their parents third ingredient so the entire offspring is more cryptic on average than the parental generation if we repeat the process over many generations and if nothing else happens to complicate our story the moths will become very hard for predators to spot they have acquired a trait that helps them to survive in their environment in evolutionary parlance they have increased their fitness and become well adapted
8402995 evolution explains the full spectrum of behaviors from selfishness to altruism and those behaviors can either be adaptive or not depending on the underlying environmental situation in this case how individuals are grouped
8402996 the good group will work together to escape the island or turn it into a little paradise while the evil group will self destruct
8402997 evolution should make us more selfish to survive and reproduce better than our neighbors not to help our neighbors survive and reproduce
8402998 but with just a little bit of thinking you can show how the traits associated with goodness can evolve by a purely darwinian process
8402999 although its very fundamental that selfishness beats altruism within single groups its equally as fundamental that altruistic groups beat selfish groups
8403000 were only three hens not nine because the other six hens had been murdered the three survivors had plucked each other during their incessant attacks and were now nearly featherless egg production plummeted during the course of the experiment even though the most productive individuals had been selected each and every generation what happened the most productive individuals had achieved their success by suppressing the productivity of their cagemates bill the poultry scientist had selected the meanest hens in each cage and after six generations had produced a nation of psychopaths
8403001 i can tell you with confidence that the eggs in your refrigerator are brought to you by good hens
8403002 the traits associated with goodness do exist in nonhuman species
8403003 only recently has evolution spilled out of biology to be applied to our own species most of the developments are within the last 10 or 15 years
8403004 at the time evolution became associated with certain political ideologies that more or less favored inequality
8403005 it was used to justify british class society and it fed into colonialism
8403006 now its become obvious that learning and culture need to be understood from an evolutionary prospective
8403007 theres a lot of great and unanswered questions in evolution dont get me wrong
8403008 rather than grind away at that to focus on understanding evolution in relation to human affairs actually cuts the gordian knot in a sense
8403009 as soon as anyone begins to understand that evolution is explanatory unthreatening and useful the first impulse is to embrace then that will solve the other political problem
8403010 ive always been interested in people part of me has always wanted to write a novel and has always been able to function in storyteller mode
8403011 most enduring religions are very highly organized to coordinate human groups as adaptive units and to ensure cooperation
8403012 that is indeed threatening to religious believers but a smaller proportion than you might think
8403013 ninety five percent of what they religious people talk about when they talk among themselves has to do with the horizontal component how to make people get along how to transmit our best values to our children and on and on
8403014 if we take all aspects of religion other than that the vertical aspect its amazing how much evolutionary theory can affirm those values
8403015 the challah has been enjoyed around the world usually for special occasion like christmas and baptisms
8403016 it can be lonely very lonely and i knew i would find it hard
8403017 but if you can stick it out for one year youre home free
8403018 but i could see central park and the lights on the chrysler building and i wasnt looking at it as a tourist i was looking at it as though i was home
8403019 that was when i realized i was getting in sync with the city
8403020 i knew it wasnt going to be easy it was something i had to do
8403021 i am in love with the city and what relationship is good if you dont work for it
8403022 any time i want to see someone and catch up with someone everyone takes out their blackberrys and says this weekend isnt good how about three weeks from now
8403023 how can you form really good and solid relationships with people if you see them once a month
8403024 the people in the street here are so nice and smiling
8403025 i always thought any time i got into taxis they were going to kidnap me and i was going to die
8403026 learning the transportation is sort of what im working on right now
8403027 im pretty good with the subways now but at night its a little weird and i dont really know how that works
8403028 but already i feel an edge developing because you need to to deal
8403029 ive definitely become the pushy new yorker who has to get around everyone on the sidewalk
8403030 my friend said the city abuses you and you just have to abuse it back
8403031 the subway doesnt work in the morning and youre a half hour late for work and thats not in your control you have to find ways of surviving
8403032 when i first got here id go out in the city with people i worked with and i felt i was missing something
8403033 i just realized that i didnt need to find it that my place in the city would fall into place
8403034 now i dont make an effort i roll with things its not just the city its yourself that you have to deal with as well
8403035 every day you encounter situations where you have to step out of your safety zone and its really kind of a self discovery experience
8403036 i see myself fighting it but i also i see myself every day becoming a new yorker
8403037 we very much wanted to create a healing environment for patients and so we drove the design by providing only either 1 or 2 bedrooms in this facility lots of natural light streaming through very large windows and wanted to give patients views to the outside or onto courtyards to inspire them on the path to healing
8403038 the abbotsford regional hospital and cancer centre is the first new regional hospital to open in more than 30 years and represents the single largest health care capital investment in the history of the province
8403039 the project was completed on time on budget and within scope an unprecedented achievement for a health care project of this size and complexity
8403040 its upon you to show that there is prejudice and the prejudice to you would be that the state would learn something about your conduct of your defense to your detriment or that i would hear something and as a fact finder be prejudice i dont believe that thats going to occur and ive taken every step to make sure it does not
8403041 this track originally appeared on johnsons second lp learning to dance all over again and was produced by
8403042 he thinks we can be direct and clear to the people without being boring
8403043 hell make it respectful but he wont shy away from the drawing the contrast
8403044 but we dont owe him our vote because the stakes are too high
8403045 we have a choice in this election do we have a president who gets that people are struggling every day who gets that veterans are struggling every day or do we have somebody who doesnt get it
8403046 and so i am going to fight as hard as i can over the next 70 days to make clear to the american people that they deserve a president and a that is fighting for them thats not fighting for the special interests thats not fighting for the banks and the oil companies and the well connected
8403047 im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8403048 oh no not more endless test squares of near identical off whites that we have to live with for weeks before she makes her mind up
8403049 when we have to begin to take a spectrum thats already crowded and now overlay all new services on top of that that is the big unknown
8403050 the wireless side is the biggest deal because theres no script you could read from
8403051 everybody involved with the political conventions is important very important you just have to ask them
8403052 credits will be pulled if anyone actually comes onto the venue with equipment they shouldnt use and they use it
8403053 that posed a new kind of challenge that hasnt been seen before

8403060 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8403061 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8403062 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8403063 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8403064 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8403065 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8403067 i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years
8403068 we had a lot of feedback from the 2004 convention that activities during the day were pretty boring but that the bloggers enjoyed hanging out together
8403069 so we thought lets create a zone where we can do that once we started down that road the interest skyrocketed
8403070 i think four years ago in boston there was nothing just a conference room with a couple of crates of beer and wifi
8403071 were getting access to the podium to the floor there really arent many places that are off limits
8403072 a lot of people find the traditional media very stale very programmed
8403073 our readers are looking for something more than a 30 second soundbite on important issues
8403074 blogs have become important because theres been a declining trust in the mainstream media particularly in the lack of hard hitting reporting in the run up to the iraq war
8403075 that combined with the new availability of tools that allows anyone to publish and create their own audience which didnt exist before
8403076 i had to take my paid time off to come here
8403077 ive pretty much exhausted my allowance for the whole year
8403078 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8403079 for me the web is a little bit siloed for a lot of users
8403080 there are all of these actions you normally take but you have to go all over the web to do them even something as simple as seeing something online and wanting to send it to yourself or someone else as an sms short message service right now thats a pretty painful experience lots of clicking lots of trundling
8403081 we have the rudimentary systems of structured natural language commands you can select something and ubiq command the software to translate this to french or e mail it to jono in both cases ubiquity is smart enough to realize what this and it refers to as well as knowing who jono is by talking with my web mails contact list
8403082 its also smart enough to be able to understand commands like map chicago comics and yelp tapas near sf and give you rich previews and search results to get you where you want to be quickly even better both of those commands let you insert results directly into say an e mail youre writing so that you never have to interrupt your chain of thought
8403083 its not yet there but it is targeted for everyone to be able to use it right now ubiquity is a 0 1 alpha prototype experiment that isnt ready for everyone
8403084 in 0 2 and on the focus there is getting the community to innovate from the edges to start making interfaces that work well for the general population that might be by being put in the awesome bar the developer of the awesome bar started looking at this

8403116 the most experienced compassionate and deserving person for the job my dear friend
8403117 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8403118 quando sono state appiccate le fiamme i bambini non si trovavano nelledificio solo la donna si trovava in una delle due camere incendiate ed rimasta ustionata nel tentativo di scappare
8403119 la suora era in un centro pastorale nel distretto di kandhamal quando stata aggredita e picchiata
8403120 it is proposed that section 3 article xi of the constitution of this state be amended to read
8403121 section 3 the general assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a system of free public schools open to all children in the state and shall establish organize and support such other public institutions of learning as may be desirable that will provide a high quality education allowing each student to reach his highest potential
8403122 first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
8403123 we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable
8403124 anything is possible but you have to believe and you have to fight
8403125 the fear of suffering is often worse than the suffering itself
8403126 its only pain and its only suffering its not going to kill you and if its not going to kill you whats the big deal
8403127 i never saw a wild thing sorry for itself a small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself
8403128 it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
8403129 the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack
8403130 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
8403131 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it
8403132 the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
8403133 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not
8403134 as a man sows he shall reap and i know that talk is cheap so the hotter the battle is the sweeter the victory
8403135 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be
8403136 heights by great men reached and kept were not obtained by sudden flight but while their companions slept they were toiling upward in the night
8403137 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog
8403138 i know i can hit and i know i can get hit what else is there
8403139 second star on the right and straight on till morning
8403140 its lack of faith that makes people afraid of meeting challenges and i believed in myself
8403141 for loan oft loses both itself and friend and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry this above all to thine ownself be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man
8403142 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it
8403143 the minute you start talking about what youre going to do if you lose you have lost
8403144 cauze p n la aceast or se nregistreaz mii de mor i n toate jude ele rii oamenii sunt sf tui i s nu ias din case i s nu consume apa dec t fiart n prealabil
8403145 through confidence in gods help especially since the more one subjects oneself to god the more is one exalted in gods sight hence augustine says it is one thing to raise oneself to god and another to raise oneself up against god he that abases himself before him him he raiseth up he that raises himself up against him him he casteth down
8403146 how can man with a single finite act merit eternal damnation
8403147 no longer will i try to assign partners for god
8403148 i know youre tired but come this is the way
8403149 the point isnt that i can do it on my own the things is that i can choose to not want to do it on my own
8403150 no s cu ndo se realizar ni la forma si ser de jornada completa o tiempo ilimitado pero la situaci n es muy tensa
8403151 contra el cuerpo de delegados el delegado destac que hay representantes que se est n comunicando con el ministerio de trabajo para que tome medidas con respecto a la decisi n del comit de tica de la uni n de tranviaria argentina
8403152 si si kuai si senme si si si kuai la
8403153 this depends on location it seems to me that is used more in the north and more in the south

8403165 but is does not mean we will make anyone an offer
8403166 i told him it was not possible at the time because there was no certainty that there would be such a position
8403167 if its someone who is willing to work hard it will be meaningful we need someone who can equip elite players and coaches with knowledge
8403168 if a coach is struggling with defence for example who does he call to help him
8403169 the problem in south africa is the way we play in contact situations thats not peters problem our ball carriers never dominate the contact situation
8403170 take a look at bismark du plessis he is a big guy but he will lose the ball eight out of ten times in contact
8403171 if you could solve that problem you wont have to send five guys to the contact point
8403172 were making a mountain out of a molehill these are small problems that can be easily solved
8403173 peter is correct in saying we should not be afraid to play with the ball

8403175 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8403176 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8403177 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8403178 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato

8403213 patient safety is always our paramount concern and so we have immediately responded to the recommendation of the idmc we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8403214 notwithstanding this disappointing outcome we would like to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and physicians who have participated in this trial
8403215 the observation in the vital 2 trial is very surprising to us and we have therefore asked the idmc to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of vital 1 in order to determine the overall prospects for our ongoing development program for this product moreover with the cessation of vital 2 we expect to make commensurate adjustments to our business operations and we will provide further details regarding this in the near future as a reminder the company ended the second quarter of 2008 with 166 million in cash

8403223 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8403224 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8403225 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need

8403229 legally an ex employer or representative of an ex employer can say anything about the employee as long as its truthful and isnt confidential like medication information
8403230 nothing prohibits them from providing truthful information about a former employee
8403231 were just here to give them guidance directions we have maps we can get them to hotels get them to the dealership get them to the maritime museum the interstate whatever they need to do
8403232 were kind of land locked in the midwest so we thought what a unique experience to cross the water on the ferry
8403233 weve been really excited about this all summer long and getting prepared for it we had special t shirts made were doing some giveaways on the ship and were working with miller lite to do some promotions as well
8403234 five years ago we came here for the 100th and we rode for twelve and a half hours and ended up in the u p and then we had to ride for nine more hours to milwaukee weve been on all these highways so we dont need to be on them again
8403235 they were expecting like 20 000 riders up through mackinaw city be easier coming this way
8403236 we get to the campground quicker because lynard skynard is there tonight and other wed be road tired this way were kind of fresh and only have an hour hour and a half down there well be rested up by the time they play tonight
8403237 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8403238 we then immediately took steps to secure the date and investigate what exactly was exposed and to notify those affected
8403239 we take this situation very seriously and we are very sorry this happened
8403240 fortunately the school divisions investigation has produced no evidence to date that this information was actually accessed by anyone during the period in question other than the security specialist who first alerted us to its presence
8403241 the good thing is we know exactly who these folks are and we were able to send them a letter directly
8403242 the final guidance is excellent news for patients with wet amd who are in need of access to this highly effective treatment
8403243 wet amd is a debilitating disease that can rapidly lead to loss of vision and all too often to loss of independence and quality of life for patients when fully implemented the nice decision will ensure that patients have access to lucentis for as long as they need to preserve or improve their vision
8403244 we are committed to working in partnership with health authorities to ensure that as many patients as possible with wet amd can benefit from treatment with lucentis
8403245 this reimbursement scheme is an important collaboration that will ensure patients living with wet amd in england and wales receive the best possible care

8403311 the north has apparently decided to stick to its guns and wait for the next administration
8403312 the us government may want to keep the status quo until the end of the november presidential election but the problem is whether the us and its allies can keep the situation under control as north korea is highly likely to continue raising tensions in coming months
8403313 the north may resort to its traditional options for brinksmanship such as the firing of long range missiles
8403314 seems to have made a strategic decision that he will no longer continue negotiations with the bush administration
8403315 at this stage if the north koreans are not prepared to make specific commitments on verification i think the process will bog down probably for the remainder of the bush administration
8403316 i dont think the bush administration will cave in on this
8403317 they are seeking to expose any divisions among the other five parties on verification

8403331 we need to have an independent inquiry an independent group to verify the amount of water thats there
8403332 then well know once and for all and politicians will be able to act and find some of that water and send it down
8403333 an inquiry thats very genuine with wide terms of reference that they can look at the on farm storages the illegal dams and levy banks that have been built any discussion or any progress so far on sequestering water down into the aquifers looking at all the pumps that are pumping water out it has to be a very extensive inquiry
8403334 at the moment high security water is the only water that does have a percentage of allocation next to it
8403335 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen and assets of problem institutions will continue to rise
8403336 noncurrent loans are still rising sharply the amount of noncurrent loans and leases 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status increased by 26 7 billion 20 percent during the second quarter following a 26 2 billion increase in the first quarter and a 27 0 billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 almost 90 percent of the increase in noncurrent loans and leases in the last three quarters consisted of real estate loans but noncurrent levels have been rising in all major loan categories at the end of june 2 04 percent of all loans and leases were noncurrent the highest level for the industry since 1993
8403337 the fdics deposit insurance fund reserve ratio fell due to a significant increase in loss reserves including reserves for failures that have occurred since june 30th the dif balance fell to 45 2 billion at the end of the second quarter down from 52 8 billion at the end of the first quarter while insured deposits rose only 0 5 percent during the quarter the decline in the fund balance caused the reserve ratio to fall to 1 01 percent as of june 30th from 1 19 percent one quarter earlier because the reserve ratio is now below 1 15 percent the federal deposit insurance reform act of 2005 requires the fdic to develop a restoration plan that will raise the reserve ratio to no less than 1 15 percent within five years
8403338 so about that 45 2 billion i had mentioned before

8403416 the deployment of air power despite the regrettable civilian casualties can be seen as militarily appropriate
8403417 the sudden war in the caucasus has dealt a blow to us prestige
8403418 europes leaders have understood that they must act but the complicated rules and regulations that govern the interplay of the 27 eu states are an invitation to distraction and quarrel the war in georgia shows that europe urgently needs a president and it lacks a common foreign minister who can forge a common foreign policy from among 27 national sensitivities it is not impossible the governments are ready the lisbon treaty is written the problem is not them up there but us here below we would have had our eu treaty in january had the majority in ireland not said no
8403419 as things now stand the crisis has renewed debate on georgias membership at the nato summit in april in bucharest merkel and steinmeier played a major role in preventing ukraine and the caucasus country from joining the alliances membership action plan map now that hostilities have erupted the germans are happy to keep as much distance as possible between them and georgia
8403420 strong criticism of the german position has also emerged from the american election campaign us presidential candidate john mccain has warned that withholding fast track membership for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for attacks on georgia somehow this makes germany partly responsible for the war in the caucasus at least in mccains eyes and that does not bode well for germany should the republican be elected president in november berlin actually had hoped that it only had to get through the last few months of the bush administration and then everything would get better but no matter who is president germanys relationship with the us promises to be fraught with tension should america allow itself to be provoked by russia
8403421 i think that a clear political statement is once again very important in this situation georgia is a free and independent country and every free and independent country can decide together with the members of nato when and how it joins nato in december there will be an initial assessment of the situation and we are clearly on track for a nato membership
8403422 moscows military leaders are not really afraid of the us missile defense system ten us interceptor missiles stand against thousands of russian warheads should it come to that as usual the main point is the respect and recognition of a russia which still has not come to terms with its loss of superpower status
8403423 there are so many unanswered questions especially as to the purpose of the missile shield since iran is obviously not yet capable of atomic weaponry and the world community wants to prevent them from obtaining such weapons which missiles is the anti missile shield going to intercept what is the nature of the threat how much will it cost the german taxpayer will there be further armament projects
8403424 concerns about possible threats emanating from putins unpredictable empire were never far from the minds of warsaw politicians after all have its eu partners in the west not criminally underestimated this danger and left the countries of eastern europe to fend for themselves against the russian bear time and time again in the past brussels did nothing when russia beat up on the baltic states with arbitrary trade restrictions when it launched a full scale cyber war against estonia and when it used specious arguments to ban polish food imports and thats not even mentioning the weak support given to the young wobbly ukrainian democracy as russia attempted to strong arm it
8403425 behind the delaying tactics is the hope that a new us administration under barack obama or hillary clinton will push the expensive missile defense with less determination than the republican bush
8403426 in eastern europe a new discussion about russia is developing that considers both the domestic and foreign policies being followed in the kremlin this mindset does not necessarily mean a new split of the nato alliance into the old us critical europeans and the new pro american europeans but it does show that the large european countries like germany and france must show more deference to the eastern european worldview
8403427 prague and warsaw are betting that their countries will be strategically more important for the united states and thus they will enjoy greater protection in the future all this is happening because of fear of ever more aggressive russia in western europe which did not experience a soviet invasion and martial law this fear is often mocked as being outdated but the recent russian invasion of georgia shows that it is a very relevant issue
8403428 that poland considering its past history with russia lacks the will to structure its priorities in another way lets say european is understandable but that the administration in washington at this point is pushing a cold war mood and is further splitting the alliance partners can mean only one thing that the current authorities have not learned from the mistakes of the past
8403429 i could not stand america this president bush has turned my homeland into a developing country everything is ailing infrastructure schools political institutions

8403431 if barack obama wins the presidential elections then sooner or later i will return to the usa
8403432 obama makes us proud of our homeland we now once again have a r reason to love our country
8403433 americans have high expectations for the successor of george w bush the united states the greatest world power of all times has lost its authority bush stands for the war in iraq torture at abu ghraib for legal inflection in guantanamo for a reckless environmental policy the new president will have to clean up repair rectify he will have to give the country a new direction and the rest of the world as well
8403434 mccains supporters are older white and uneducated men by contrast obamas quasi european voters are female but especially young and smart
8403435 if democrats want to win they will have to rid themselves of their european appearance
8403436 i support ideas for the rest of the world barack embodies a new america and the rest of the world as well as the usa have earned a new america
8403437 a visible sign that the important thing in these deliberations is love is the rainbow flag that flew over the hamburg city hall from july 31 to august 3 to commemorate the local gay pride celebration
8403438 the cdu is germanys leading conservative party and its attitude toward creating a legal foundation for registered same sex partnerships has ranged from reluctance to rejection i am committed to attaining complete equality between married couples and registered life partners but in germany the time for this unfortunately has not yet arrived in germany many conservative people attach every bit as much importance to the remaining legal differences between heterosexual spouses and same sex partners as conservatives in the united states attach to the exclusive use of the term marriage to describe the bond between a man and a woman
8403439 a chair for the sick with small wheels the kind you see in old us movies
8403440 i would not exclude having said that but if they are going to provide us with such a splendid contraption they can at least help us out with it

8403442 es tremendamente importante hacer ciertas cosas como usar vestidos y ropa bordada despu s de todo la masa sigue a los que tienen clase la clase nunca sigue a las masas
8403443 one of the problems mccain would have if he picked romney was that it takes the joe biden issue off the table where biden is saying great things about mccain and terrible things about obama
8403444 thats true for both parties and mccains running ads right now featuring hillary endorsing him
8403445 there is a gold mine of hillary audio and video that mccain can make an ad of those things happen in primaries
8403446 morris said the mistake republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set what we wanted to do was run a
8403447 so we opened the campaign with ads that characterized mike as more of a moderate whose values were the same as those of other arkansans
8403448 if life doesnt begin at conception then why are people buying condoms by the package
8403449 we just want a little bit of respect and if our guy doesnt win on the first ballot well vote for you

8403454 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8403455 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8403456 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8403457 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8403458 hes done everything for this organization they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8403459 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8403460 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8403461 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8403462 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8403463 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8403464 in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8403465 knee jerk calls for russia to be expelled from the g 8 or for eu russia or nato russia relations to be broken
8403466 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8403467 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8403468 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8403469 this defendant uses the time that he has to think out these plans and he is dangerous
8403470 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8403471 the parking lot of which is a regular meeting place for narcotic transactions according to trooper tirella
8403472 hes been given the opportunity and much more than hundreds of other people that come before this court with a drug problem
8403473 youve had the opportunity to get rehab since july 2 i dont think that max is serious about going to rehab if he is he wouldve gone three months ago
8403474 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8403475 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8403476 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8403477 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals

8403489 the good news is that its not too hard to get going there are only a couple of bugs that need to be worked around
8403490 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8403491 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8403492 are you kidding me i work part time im in college how the hell could i possibly pay for a credit card with 22 apr dont ever call me again
8403493 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8403494 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8403495 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8403496 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8403497 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8403498 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8403499 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8403500 theres ups and downs in this game but i dont even view this as a down
8403501 the horse has retired without something terrible happening and hopefully hell live a happy and healthy life
8403502 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states candrea said
8403503 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8403504 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8403505 i am anxious to continue my involvement to help get this sport back in the olympic games candrea said
8403506 we have 14 months to show the ioc that the sport of softball belongs at the olympic level i plan to assist in the education process for both athletes and coaches at all levels in order to keep the pipeline alive and healthy
8403507 thats a lot of money you pretty much lost 300 dollars

8403509 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8403510 you will never know which parts of the internet youll need
8403511 because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website

8403516 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8403517 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8403518 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8403519 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8403520 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8403521 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8403522 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8403523 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8403524 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8403525 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8403526 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8403527 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8403528 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8403529 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8403530 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8403531 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8403532 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8403533 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8403534 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8403535 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8403536 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8403537 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8403538 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8403539 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8403540 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8403541 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8403542 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8403543 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8403544 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8403545 federal revenues should have been down nearly 20 billion in the first quarter given the measures set out in last falls economic statement
8403546 instead only a 1 1 billion reduction is showing up in the national accounts
8403547 including money for nova scotia bombardier money for festivals and ribbon cutting cutting ceremonies right across this country
8403548 this is not a government that is going to fall back into deficit and for good reason voters wont support that
8403549 so how do you explain this irresponsible spending it is because they have the money to do it and that is coming from higher than expected revenues flowing in from taxes
8403550 slower economic growth is a negative but right now inflation is above two per cent and were having faster nominal income growth as a consequence and that gets taxed
8403551 over the medium term the conference board expects that the federal government will be able to continue to generate fiscal surpluses
8403552 what we found was astonishing which was that they all had the same mass
8403553 its not what we were expecting we were really taken off guard
8403554 these are by far the dimmest galaxies that have ever been discovered and the least luminous of these things are the most dark matter dominated things that we know about
8403555 i have to say right now were totally at a loss
8403556 maybe weve kind of hit a limit of how dark matter can cluster and if thats true maybe that tells us something about the dark matter particle itself
8403557 you can think of a dark matter clump as a well and the more massive the dark matter clump the deeper that well is and the harder it is for the normal matter to float out of it
8403558 it could be that there are smaller clumps but their wells are so shallow that any normal matter just falls right out
8403559 we want to try to figure out if what were learning is really a limit on how massive a clump of dark matter can be or just a limit on massive a galaxy can be
8403560 the thing i find extremely puzzling is well what does this tell us about physics is it truly a problem with galaxy formation or is it touching something fundamental about dark matter its a very interesting result and deserves attention and its something that now we have to think about we have a lot of work to do
8403561 where are my other guys are they okay only two of the five survived
8403562 ive seen war up close not as a political slogan or some think tank theory he said
8403563 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies and consult with our allies
8403564 what the jets are doing is different than the giants
8403565 they are leaving 27 000 seats psl free a large portion of the stadium fan base will be able to buy seats without having to purchase a psl
8403566 even if they choose to rehab a stadium on top of escalated seat prices
8403567 but keep in mind that the park in mexico city is actually at a higher elevation than coors field
8403568 previous studies have showed that the steep decline begins around five years before death
8403569 what we could see in our data is that these changes occur much earlier than thought
8403570 there is substantial acceleration in cognitive decline many years prior to death among individuals without dementia
8403571 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8403572 samir maintains this was no criminal enterprise but simply a business transaction this will be the issue at trial is it a criminal enterprise or just a business transaction
8403573 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8403574 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of training camp
8403575 qualunque strada tu scelga con chiunque tu scelga di condividerla mi basta che tu sia felice vorrei poter dire che questo il mio desiderio pi profondo ma in realt purtroppo non ho un carattere cos equilibrato la mia immagine cos come si riflette nei tuoi occhi insieme forte e delicata come quella di un eroe dei fumetti troppo perfetta per essere vera
8403576 ancora oggi continuo a pensare che ognuno sia artefice del suo destino
8403577 the reason kobe is as big as he is here is not an accident
8403578 kobe realized some years ago that the china market is a great place to be and hes been here consistently every year for five or six years
8403579 if you want to know the truth the thing was broken
8403580 nothing the thing didnt work i was laughing at them you know if i was doing anything i was grabbing it and trying to put it back down
8403581 it is suspicious that so many senior customs officers were partying at the same spot we are investigating who was behind this party
8403582 we are also trying to find out whether the dance girls were employed by some escort service
8403583 considering national interest as the top priority and responding to the appeal of the security agencies the samiti finally decided to cancel the sangharsh rally
8403584 we appeal to all the people to maintain peace and communal harmony and extend cooperation to the security forces combating the militants

8403589 you dont make your firmware out of thin air it must contain your key
8403590 our campaign welcomes everyone republicans democrats or independents wanting to work in good faith to improve our state
8403591 dinos proven he has the ability to work in a bipartisan fashion to fix some of our most challenging problems and that is something that people from across the political spectrum can get behind
8403592 i think hes going to be very important to our state and the message that he is sending about the kind of change he wants to bring nationally is the kind of change weve made happen in our home state
8403593 remember non laughing is laughing in negation an omission of mirth that should be celebrated with laughter
8403594 sorry everyone osu might make it back to the title game
8403595 its been fantastic its been great to be part of such a winning team not just the sailing team but the whole of team gb
8403596 its great to be back home now and im just really overwhelmed with the reception weve had here
8403597 it would be great to race on your home waters im hoping the olympics in london in 2012 will be massive
8403598 i think the success of the team this time round has hopefully inspired the nation to get behind the games and thats what we need to go out and win more medals
8403599 its a dream come true weve worked so hard to try and bring home a gold medal and the reception weve had here back in london and now in lymington is much more than we ever expected
8403600 its just fantastic and were just loving every minute of it
8403601 its just fantastic to see all the people i know and love and to be here with them all is great
8403602 to have two gold medals and one silver from the same yacht club is i think unprecedented
8403603 people here are now thinking they can go on and do it which is a really good thing
8403604 weve had some really good sailors and yes weve got more coming through
8403605 we can confirm that on 21 august a single hotel in germany was compromised by a virus the compromise permitted access to reservations data for that property only
8403606 this has affected only ten customers who are currently being contacted to offer our assistance none of these were gb customers there is no evidence of any unauthorised access to any other customer data
8403607 only a little but its going to hurt more later wont it
8403608 i didnt think you could i mean ive worn tampons for years and its still there
8403609 they arent as long or as hard as my finger baby
8403610 im going to put a second finger inside you now okay
8403611 to get something to clean you up ill be right back
8403612 il destino il destino il desino quel che non c scampo pi per me
8403613 companies cannot afford to be out of action for any extended period of time because they risk losing customers in the short term and damaging their relationship in the longer term
8403614 this survey highlights the fact that some businesses have a long way to go in getting their plans up to scratch
8403615 my wife and i just got back from 3 weeks in thailand and found your backpacks to both of good design and good quality and would gladly recommend them to anyone regards bob

8403617 i cant believe how many images ive seen of obama
8403618 you know what denver reminds me of a developing country with a strongman dictator obamas everywhere
8403619 you just got to wait and see its a wait and see game
8403620 ive been down here three years and i aint never seen anything like it
8403621 a pesar de que se trata de un contrato r gido oneroso y con pensiones imposibles de soportar por parte de la empresa

8403624 g3 got together to plan how they were going to co ordinate a
8403625 plan in order to save the paper thin house of cards called the us federal reserve
8403626 officials from the u s treasury department japans finance ministry and the european central bank drew up the currency intervention plan over the weekend of march 15 16
8403627 in addition to agreeing on the need to limit excessive swings in the foreign exchange market they hammered out a framework for co ordinating a dollar buying intervention
8403628 anyone unaware of whats happening inside the club and just looking for somewhere to drink til 5am wont get in
8403629 we want a crowd who invests in their night checking out the latest happenings on myspace or facebook people coming to the club for a reason a lot will be word of mouth but were also expecting a lot of the existing regulars from the various parties
8403630 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8403631 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8403632 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8403633 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition of when life begins
8403634 there are plenty of catholics living a life rife with sin that seek to justify their behavior by saying they disagree with the church on the source of their delinquency
8403635 maybe thats the source of pelosis confusion she really doesnt understand the difference between the teaching authority of the catholic church and the dnc
8403636 have the stage an attentive audience and a winning position
8403637 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8403638 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8403639 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8403640 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8403641 i am anxious to continue my involvement to help get this sport back in the olympic games
8403642 we have 14 months to show the ioc that the sport of softball belongs at the olympic level i plan to assist in the education process for both athletes and coaches at all levels in order to keep the pipeline alive and healthy
8403643 it can be viewed primarily as having achieved at most disconnected islands of progress without a decisive impact on overall border security
8403644 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8403645 even within our own church theres been debates about life you know from from summa theologica aquinas and 40 days to quickening and right to you know you know pius ix animated fetus doctrine and so on
8403646 and the decision that i have come to is roe v wade is as close to were going to be able to get as a society that incorporates the general lines of debate within christendom judaism and other faiths where it basically says there is a sliding scale relating to viability of a fetus
8403647 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8403648 why you just dont leave your catholic faith behind instead of continuing to call yourself catholics even though you mock catholic teaching
8403649 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8403650 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8403651 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8403652 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8403653 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8403684 on sunday democratic delegates convening in denver were prayed over by representatives of various faiths one stood out ingrid mattson president of the islamic society of north america with this choice barak obamas campaign has committed a strategic error of the first order
8403685 if muslim americans are to participate in such a critique of american policy however they will only be effective if they do it according to the prophets words in a
8403686 theres a prejudgment a collective judgment of muslims and a suspicion that well
8403687 chat participant what can you tell us about the wahhabi sect of islam is it true that this is an extremely right wing sect founded and funded by the saudi royal family and led by osama bin ladin what is the purpose of the wahhabi mattson no its not true to characterize wahhabism that way this is not a sect it is the name of a reform movement that began 200 years ago to rid islamic societies of cultural practices and rigid interpretation that had acquired over the centuries it really was analogous to the european protestant reformation because the wahhabi scholars became integrated into the saudi state there has been some difficulty keeping that particular interpretation of religion from being enforced too broadly on the population as a whole however the saudi scholars who are wahhabi have denounced terrorism and denounced in particular the acts of september 11 those statements are available publicly this question has arisen because last week there were a number of newspaper reports that were dealing with this they raised the issue of the role of saudi arabia and the ideology there frankly i think in a way it was a reaction to the attempts of many people to look for the roots of terrorism in misguided foreign policy its not helpful i believe to create another broad category that that becomes the scapegoat for terrorism 5 mattson on the islamic caliphate chat participant osama bin laden made a reference that muslims have been living in humiliation for 80 years did he refer to the treaty of sevres in 1920 that dismantled caliphates and sultanates mattson yes he is referring to that to the overthrowing of the caliphate which was a plan of european powers for many years this deprived the muslim world of a stable and centralized authority and much of the chaos that were living in today is the result of that
8403688 there are different kinds of tafseers for e g there are ones that contain detailed interpretations of grammatical aspects of quranic language and there are others that serve to explain the general message of quran coupled with the experiences and insights of the author of the tafseer however there arent really any tafseers that combine the both aspects so far probably the best work of tafseer in english is by maulana abul ala maududi
8403689 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
8403690 islamic jihad does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which in the view of islam is evil furthermore islamic jihad also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of islam
8403691 these kinds of statements are really irresponsible because they can lead to violence against ordinary people i dont see any difference between that and al qaeda and osama bin laden using islamic theology to justify violence against americans whats interesting is if you compare their statements about what islam is and what muslims believe youll find they are almost identical and i reject both interpretations both the non muslims who are saying that islam justifies violence against christians and jews and the muslims who are saying it certainly these statements have a very unnerving effect especially when they continue when more than one person says it
8403692 ingrid mattson the first woman president of the islamic society of north america said friday at the opening of the groups 43rd annual convention that labeling terrorism as
8403693 im convinced that it is not only inaccurate but unhelpful if our major concern is security security of this country this is a term that has very bad resonance in the muslim majority world and makes us feel uncomfortable here
8403694 this perception that women in islam are oppressed is based both on misinformation as well as am amplification of certain unfortunate tendencies in some parts of the muslim world its true that people have seen some muslim authorities using islam as a justification for the oppression or suppression of women thats a reality we cant deny it but we have to balance those incidents with whats going on in the rest of the muslim world in which most women are participating in their societies weve seen that within recent times four muslim majority nations have had female heads of state in most countries that ive traveled to muslim women are involved in all aspects of society

8403714 there may be current efforts under way to close down railhead completely

8403745 no more adventures trying to cross the busy 101 highway
8403746 are currently doing the planning and design work necessary to prepare this section of highway for construction tender readiness
8403747 i would like to clarify that the project limits will be from the existing twinning at hortonville to just west of the cornwallis river 1 5 km west of exit 14 at coldbrook a distance of 27 5 km
8403748 and staff estimate it wont be ready for construction for a number of years as the construction will take an additional four to five years the completion of this section will not be possible by 2012
8403749 the upgrading of highway 101 continues to be one of our key priorities
8403750 however even with increased federal funding the timelines required to prepare for projects of this size remain substantial
8403751 which should help alleviate some of the congestion on commercial street
8403752 est ce que vous vous sentez la hauteur de la situation lors des man uvres suivantes
8403753 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8403754 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8403755 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8403756 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8403757 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8403758 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8403759 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8403760 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8403761 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8403762 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8403763 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8403764 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8403765 in any moment of decision the best thing you can do is the right thing the next best thing is the wrong thing and the worst thing you can do is nothing
8403766 diversity and inclusion are part of the dna of mtv networks it drives our success and our goals both onscreen and off
8403767 we are thrilled and honored to receive this recognition from imagen
8403768 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8403769 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8403770 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8403771 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8403772 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8403773 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8403774 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8403775 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8403776 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8403777 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8403778 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8403779 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8403780 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8403781 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8403782 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8403783 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8403784 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8403785 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8403786 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8403787 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8403788 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8403789 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8403790 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8403791 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8403792 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8403793 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8403794 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

8403797 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8403798 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8403799 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8403800 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8403801 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8403802 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8403803 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8403804 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8403805 i use to have superpowers before my therapist took them away
8403806 we understand the authenticity of the brand among hispanics and general market consumers especially mothers of young children and hope to further extend our loyalty by continuing to develop flavors and sizes that resonate with our target consumers
8403807 the idea with the tips was to make the brand relevant for mom and make her feel good about being just that mom the tips are informational in nature that she can use to care for the family especially the kids for example a few of the tips include information on proper summer time nutrition swimming safety and back to school basics
8403808 we are thrilled to be working with such a strong brand like tampico
8403809 our goal for this campaign is to engage moms and allow them to feel good about buying tampico for the entire family not only did we need to communicate the variety of flavors but also the unique packaging that tampico offers there is virtually a size for every family member and occasion

8403813 there is no strong evidence yet for specific gene variants alleles gt that lead to group differences differences between clusters in gt behavior or intelligence but progress on the genomic side of this gt question will be rapid in coming years as the price to sequence a gt genome is dropping at an exponential rate
8403814 what seems to be true from preliminary studies is that the gene variants that were under strong selection reached fixation over the last 10k years are different in different clusters that is the way that modern people in each cluster differ due to natural selection from their own ancestors 10k years ago is not the same in each cluster we have been at least at the genetic level experiencing divergent evolution

8403828 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8403829 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8403843 we won the ttt in the extremadura tour and we worked hard for dan lloyd to win that one overall with two days to go i had a bad day and unfortunately so did the rest of the squad we left dan isolated and he could have lost it i was really annoyed at myself for letting him down but on the last day i was really stomping and i set a tough tempo on all the climbs so that no one could jump him i was proud of the way i rode that day and dan was very grateful he did a lot of work for me in the pyrenees and i think that was his pay back for extremadura

8403860 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8403861 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8403862 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8403863 weve seen a great change and i thank the city and what theyve done
8403864 the great thing about a community like this is theres opportunity
8403865 we have got to get more people to step forward take an active roll where they live we need people to love their city
8403866 there needs to be more emphasis on this community to do more
8403867 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403868 its official barack obama has received no bounce in voter support out of his selection of sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
8403869 the gallup daily tracking poll from aug 23 25 the first three day period falling entirely after obamas saturday morning vice presidential announcement shows 46 of national registered voters backing john mccain and 44 supporting obama not appreciably different from the previous weeks standing for both candidates this is the first time since obama clinched the nomination in early june though that mccain has held any kind of advantage over obama in gallup poll daily tracking
8403870 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403871 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8403872 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8403873 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8403874 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8403875 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8403876 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403877 its got to be through relationships handing out religious tracts would not go over well at all that would be like me walking around with a free tibet flag
8403878 if foreigners do such things in china they violate the law and local religious departments and other departments should stop them
8403879 they looked for opportunities to talk to the locals and share about their faith
8403880 our goal was wanting to communicate the love of god to people not be overt
8403881 it was almost like they were treating us like criminals
8403882 we thought wed stay away from beijing we honestly didnt come here to cause trouble
8403883 when you assign a chaplain its almost like saying were bringing a team to china and assigning the coach well the coach doesnt know the players and only knows the sport we feel the spiritual realm is the same way
8403884 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403885 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8403886 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8403887 failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8403888 barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaida and press russia to live up to its obligations
8403889 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8403890 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8403891 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8403892 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright
8403893 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8403894 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403895 pastor romero shouted out about the concerns that led him to protest namely the ratification of the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr and the release of five prisoners representing five key areas of concern
8403896 groups of supporters greeted him and he has since given interviews to two local news stations
8403897 eddie does not want the chinese authorities to ignore his message by deporting him he wants the message to get through to them he wants the world to get through to them his cause is good ratify and release
8403898 relieved to hear of pastor eddie romeros safe return to america it is important his concerns are not forgotten now
8403899 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403900 people say arent you embarrassed and ashamed to stand up and say you had abortions
8403901 id be more embarrassed if i didnt tell you because it is wrong and without the grace and mercy of jesus christ i would not have been forgiven
8403902 he delivered some very startling and surprising words they expected the rhetoric that always proceeds but he began to tell the audience i am a pro life democrat we want to commend those men and women and say that life is a civil right life is precious and that it transcends politics
8403903 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8403904 we are also deeply shocked and anguished to hear of the atrocities and violence meted out to the innocent christians and churches in orissa as a backlash of the sorrowful event
8403905 and we are praying for an immediate halt to the violence
8403906 what is most disturbing is that these attacks seem to be well organized and orchestrated
8403907 we have reports that the vhp have actually held strategy meetings in order to plan and coordinate this campaign of violence against peaceful christian families and churches
8403908 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our bible college campus and trying to protect our people
8403909 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
8403910 we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time
8403911 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven

8404014 we have seen reports that there are atrocities being committed against civilians
8404015 we want to call on the russians to allow credible investigation to take place on reports that atrocities have been committed by all sides
8404016 obviously these types of reports are of serious concern and we want to make sure that the international community is able to investigate these charges because we all take them very seriously

8404023 house democratic leaders and protesters waving a war of words tuesday at a press event outside an old train station the demonstrators interrupted house speaker
8404024 for us its about trying to create pressure around that lineout and the two key guys are the thrower and the caller so if you can create pressure for them to operate under its going to be more difficult
8404025 their decision making becomes a lot less accurate and that doesnt necessarily just apply to south africa thats at any time
8404026 i just thought through the level of accuracy the guys were able to put into it they were able to create a pressure situation where guys who are very very good made errors and thats what youre aiming for every week
8404027 the guys did a particularly good job probably one of our better performances against south africa in the last couple of years theres no doubt
8404028 these individuals are highly dedicated and train year round in high angle rescue first aid and fire fighting techniques for use in coal mine emergencies

8404035 i think her intelligence just increased her hotness factor by another 50 points shell never go out with me man
8404036 guys are always checking you out they like your hair your eyes your pretty face and your butt but that is the very first time ive ever heard a guy say that they think youre hotter now that they know youre smart would you date him
8404037 well not only does he think youre pretty but he now finds you even more attractive because youre smart most guys dont like super smart girls so when you find one that does and he wants to date you you should grab onto him because the chances of finding another guy who likes you for being smart are pretty slim mom if he does work up the courage to ask you out you should definitely say yes plus he seems like a nice guy
8404038 the bpu has been a leader on the issue of diversifying access to business opportunities within the utility arena to businesses owned by minorities women and disabled veterans these businesses offer unique skills and perspectives and so this conference is a great opportunity to bring mwbes and the utilities together
8404039 this is a great opportunity for minority and women owned businesses to make connections with utilities
8404040 i hope that people will save the date register early and spread the word to their colleagues and business partners the more people who attend the more valuable the experience will be

8404042 its amazing in the festivals kick off year we are launching a festival within a festival
8404043 the meatpacking district is the nucleus of the weekend not only is it home to some of the greatest chefs but will also be the hub of all festival activity for three straight days we are very proud of the home grown and grassroots activities taking place from panels such as
8404044 as the neighborhood host to the first annual food network new york city wine amp food festival our district will roll out the red carpet for thousands of guests who seek the best in food and wine
8404045 more than 100 shops and restaurants in our area are so pleased to be part of this great event its a natural for us this neighborhood has always been a food lifeline for new york city
8404046 meatpacking local kicks off theres so much to choose from food and culture walking tours wine tastings hors doeuvre demonstrations and samplings panel discussions and even new yorks own greenmarket boasting the freshest local produce direct from the farm
8404047 i dont want to know what you believe i want to know what you think
8404048 what concerns me today is that our council will most likely vote on this matter at the next council meeting and i think the votes are currently there for passing whatever dollar amount our elected leaders see fit as far as i see this matter itll have at least 3 solid votes for spending in franklin olson sohns and solomon
8404049 until i see an economic impact study with the benefits for the city of franklin i will not vote on this proposal
8404050 someone needs to figure out the benefit increase for each community
8404051 coming to the city of franklin for money at this point i dont think is appropriate oak creek officials havent approached any other players including south milwaukee and milwaukee county to involve them nor have they gone to the dot and fought the case that this is a regional issue

8404060 what then is the argument against honoring him it can only be this fuzzy idea that we must not dare offend those who were offended by rushdies novel the satanic verses but what possible obligation are we under not to offend them
8404061 tom im not aware of any argument that prevents the major u s press outlets from discussing such issues
8404062 the fbi is pissed at having gone to such lengths and having found absolutely nothing besides a 256 technicality that wont even stick theyre pissed about how they have been made to look like total idiots in the press for pushing ahead with this when everyone can see theres nothing there and theyre probably pissed about caes writings which i remember someone speculating they paid someone to read very carefully

8404064 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
8404065 we wanted to give the mustang pony a more realistic feel
8404066 its more chiseled and more defined and looks more like a wild horse
8404067 its more realistic in terms of proportion to an actual mustang
8404068 were very much concerned with detail and precision in our cars at ford and that includes the art we do
8404069 we want our mustang pony badge to be as good as the rest of the car

8404097 we have considered it in the future but for the time being will not be
8404098 this building is being renovated and being turned into apartments so well definitely be considering it in the future
8404099 if you cant make it without the bok youre not going to make it with the bok
8404100 they probably have to see whats going to happen in downtown but im absolutely sure downtown is changing
8404101 of maine trebuie sa l urc din nou ce naspa o sa fie etc

8404105 we have no reason to doubt that courts faced with these sensitive matters will pay proper heed
8404106 if implemented for most law schools the changes in rankings would most likely be very small because the differences between their combined data for both full and part time entering students versus full time only are minimal
8404107 well its a long drive from oregon and maybe he stopped along the way and doesnt have cell phone reception and
8404108 the manufacturing industry is the one thats been hit hardest in michigan
8404109 its imperative its absolutely critical our automotive dropped off 50 60 and consequently that translates to 30 jobs and to keep those jobs were expanding into other areas that are less cyclic
8404110 everyone uses light everyone uses energy so its a far broader market than auto ever was
8404111 i am familiar with several of our contemporaries who are in the auto industry but are also in the energy business being flexible and agile in the maketplace is absolutely critical sometimes we have to look forward to see whats sustainable
8404112 only a person of good reputation can continue a crime like this
8404113 thats why it is such a significant breach of trust
8404114 to find out that he had done this to us there was anger extreme anger
8404115 we obviously want to build on our success of last season
8404116 our goal is to finish in the top four of the maac standings qualify for the maac championship and put ourselves in position to earn a spot at the ncaa tournament
8404117 alan will be playing out wide this season where we see him building on his success of last year and becoming the top player in the conference
8404118 adam is moving from the midfield to the target position
8404119 he is a big body with a very nice touch so he will look to be our go to guy up top
8404120 we will look for him to have his most productive year of his career pablo is a very crafty and skillful player that will look to create chances throughout the year
8404121 eddie powell victor gonzalez and kyle westerholt will anchor our midfield this season
8404122 we expect those three to give us some quality minutes and perform at a high level with returners peter leoni and hector rodriguez contributing to our success and adding depth
8404123 lyndon is back for his senior season and we will look for his experience on the field and for him to be a leader for the defense
8404124 sean has been very good his two years here and we expect him to be back at all maac form
8404125 both luke and adam are very similar types of goalkeepers
8404126 it is up to whoever steps up and takes charge to see who gets the nod i am very confident with either one in net
8404127 uttered repeatedly in a voice intended to knock you out cold on your couch if true this could turn out to be my favorite and the least consequential endorsement deal of all time shes

8404140 federal revenues should have been down nearly 20 billion in the first quarter given the measures set out in last falls economic statement
8404141 instead only a 1 1 billion reduction is showing up in the national accounts
8404142 including money for nova scotia bombardier money for festivals and ribbon cutting cutting ceremonies right across this country
8404143 this is not a government that is going to fall back into deficit and for good reason voters wont support that
8404144 so how do you explain this irresponsible spending it is because they have the money to do it and that is coming from higher than expected revenues flowing in from taxes
8404145 slower economic growth is a negative but right now inflation is above two per cent and were having faster nominal income growth as a consequence and that gets taxed
8404146 over the medium term the conference board expects that the federal government will be able to continue to generate fiscal surpluses
8404147 the worldwide prediction for 2008 is revised downwards by just over a percentage point from 6 0 to 4 9 2009 is also very slightly reduced from 4 9 growth to 4 8
8404148 internet is set to overtake radio this year to become the worlds third most popular medium behind tv and print
8404149 with search now central to the planning and execution of any campaign online media brings a greater level of accountability not just to itself but to tv print and other forms of advertising
8404150 your garden variety sql and xss is being replaced by encoded versions
8404151 any injection style attack can be encoded using 100 different techniques and variations
8404152 the bar is being raised each month with different levels of obfuscation and encryption being used
8404153 its nice to have the statistics to back up our claims on csrf but there are always more csrf vulnerabilities than we can find
8404154 fewer and fewer of our customers websites are having these issues occur by percentage as a result of weekly vulnerability assessments secure coding best practices and developer education
8404155 as markets become more and more global and all other major capital markets have embraced ifrs it is clear that the sec needed to require companies to begin the complex process of converting their books to ifrs at resources we see the benefits of adoption of ifrs as multi dimensional ifrs will better position american companies to access capital in the global marketplace and provide for consistency in financial reporting for the benefit of investors credit rating agencies and others around the globe
8404156 elected on the promise to end the war pelosi and her democrats have instead voted repeatedly to fund it until the next administration
8404157 even more galling to the anti war crowd is that there are even more troops in iraq under pelosis congress than there ever were during republican congresses
8404158 you will take this new software and make it work through this pretty portal we made for you and youll charge clients a bundle to use the portal and like it
8404159 ah but we promised clients they wouldnt have to pay extra and either we give them back their money or we find a way to make this work on macs
8404160 can we discuss making it work on mac at least in a limited fashion since it only works in a limited fashion on pc
8404161 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8404162 it seemed egregious that there is this recent and ongoing relationship
8404163 spent a lot of time and resources to do things right
8404164 what has been a surprise has been the extent to which the obama camp has employed what could be characterized as intimidation or attempted intimidation
8404165 the idea of running to the justice department demanding prosecution its really beyond the pale it smacks of a kind of desperation about the issue that we didnt expect
8404166 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8404167 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8404168 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8404169 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8404170 i think we shouldnt be too complacent or too scared in a situation like this
8404171 to give up and surrender and say to the russians its your backyard youve won or to put men on the ground to protect georgias sovereignty and the east west oil and gas pipeline from the caspian and central asia
8404172 my hearing loss is an enormous challenge in both my personal and professional lives i have hope that there will be new restorative therapies for hearing loss in my lifetime
8404173 there is intense interest in cell replacement strategies to ameliorate the effects of inner ear disease but until now we didnt have direct evidence indicating we could make a functional sensory hair cell
8404174 we have the first step down we can induce functional sensory hair cells to form now we need to learn if its possible to restore hearing in a deaf mouse mutant experiments that are ongoing we know its possible to generate sensory hair cells that function and thats an important step toward defining rational therapies in humans i am profoundly hard of hearing the exciting news for those of us with hearing loss and tinnitus is that we now have hope of having our hearing restored some day
8404175 siempre dije que estaba contento en ac mil n y como mis objetivos son los mismos que los del club yo me quedo siempre ha sido as mi meta es ganar as como la del milan vimos los esfuerzos que el club hace en ese sentido

8404177 estamos en el afine ya en la parte final para llegar a un acuerdo
8404178 estamos viendo en d nde lo vamos a recibir y a qu hora
8404179 no lo hemos visto lo tenemos que abordar en la plenaria y primero tenemos que analizar con seriedad y responsabilidad el informe
8404180 i was suspicious when i was at stannies im more suspicious now about the boys going late at night to staff quarters there were also outings we had camping overnight in tents at places like trunkey creek
8404181 many thanks to dealnews for the ipod nano dealnews is the first place i go each day when i connect to the internet its the greatest shopping site for saving money and finding great gifts for all those birthdays that keep popping up keep up the good work
8404182 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
8404183 the labor members of a senate committee have decided to rush out a report which endorses labor policy
8404184 the reality is that fuelwatch will not only not put the price of petrol down it will actually increase it
8404185 fuelwatch is nothing more than foolwatch and those labor mps that have decided to endorse it are doing nothing more than following mr rudd
8404186 its a rather unusual step that a senate committee would put out an interim report the purpose of which is to do nothing more than to deceive the independent senators
8404187 fuelwatch is sham it has the potential to push up the price of fuel for motorists its nothing more than a quick fix for kevin rudd the committee has failed to justify its position
8404188 the analysis by the accc has been criticised the committee travelled the width and breadth of the country and struggled to find anyone who would support this hare brained scheme
8404189 certainly the accs work is certainly subject to some considerable question
8404190 fuelwatch is working against independent petrol retailers in western australia in fact many have closed down since the introduction
8404191 there were 200 independent petrol retailers before fuelwatch there are now 17
8404192 the mums and dads who run grocery stores across australia are having to fight against a taxpayer funded advertising campaign for coles and woollies
8404193 he does like to watch he is like peter sellers in being there he likes to watch
8404194 grocerychoice is a classic it must be the single most useless government website ever created it contains not one skerrick of useful information
8404195 i would encourage everyone to have a look at it and just see how our taxes are being wasted
8404196 it was based on party lines its nothing new from my point of view
8404197 if you really want to reduce fuel prices in this country you need to look at the stranglehold the big four oil companies have on wholesale fuel supply and distribution and fuelwatch just doesnt do that
8404198 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
8404199 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8404200 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8404201 being a u s based tour and with the majority of our fan base pro am contestants sponsors and participants being english speaking we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in english
8404202 we live in a sports entertainment environment for an athlete to be successful today in the sports entertainment world we live in they need to be great performers on and off the course and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this
8404203 if you can get universal health care or something close to it in however imperfect then the country will never be the same again it will be something that is an untouchable and it will make people just understand once again that government can do things to make the society fairer safer
8404204 one of the things that the republicans have been good at is thinking a step ahead playing the log game setting things up
8404205 starve the beast deprive the government of revenue so it cant do staff later on
8404206 unions raise wages but they also shift the political balance the destruction of the union movement in the 1980s which was largely a ronald reagan thing did not just undercut the workers bargaining power but it also undercut their political power
8404207 that is a big enough agenda to keep a democratic congress and president busy for a couple of years
8404208 bill cinton in 1992 had this very simple thing the hard working people the people who played by the rules who try to do it right get cheated he had a phrase about people who cut corners and cut deals and we need to hear that i think the theory that a broad post partisan appeal could lead to a transformative victory appears to have been refuted
8404209 we were fighting the church the couch and the courts
8404210 nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner why not discard the hermitage for the heritage that awaits any red blooded american woman who dares to claim it
8404211 being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men
8404212 self acceptance and a good sense of my own self worth
8404213 we believe everyone in the world deserves access to trusted payment solutions and the opportunities and freedoms that come with participating in the financial mainstream
8404214 over half the worlds population lives in asia pacific so our partnership with scx global is essential in creating inclusive financial services for the underserved worldwide were thrilled to have found the right partner in scx global a company with a proven understanding of the regional landscape and a successful track record introducing consumers in the region to the benefits of innovative payment solutions

8404217 low income households access to financial services international experience measures for improvement and the future
8404218 there was information gathered through either staff or inmates that there was an escape plan
8404219 but they couldnt determine what unit was involved which inmates whether it was from inside the unit or outside the prison on maybe an escort or something so they were just trying to glean some of that information
8404220 they said that there was no specific intelligence to this breakout happening on that unit with those inmates
8404221 if the intelligence was specific then we should have been locking down the prison in this case with no specifics they didnt feel it necessary to lock down the whole prison
8404222 inside the unit preliminary investigation has determined that some of the bricks were in fact removed
8404223 the hole was big enough for a person to fit through thats pretty obvious
8404224 the ministry officials have told me they cant determine if they climbed over the fence or how they got out of the yard
8404225 the section that was breached was built in 1960s im looking at the investigation team telling me if we have longstanding structural problems
8404226 to breach a wall inside the unit in what is a very secure unit causes me grave concern
8404227 our members have been working with management to improve the current system which is not working but to date many issues remain unresolved
8404228 we believe there are systemic problems that need to be addressed
8404229 we dont have confirmation that theyre gang members we dont know if this had a role to play
8404230 a n vel global posso dizer que gostei do jogo
8404231 as a woman and a democrat she deserves that show of support
8404232 the most important thing to remember is that when we all get home were solidly obama supporters
8404233 barack obama is a living embodiment of the american dream
8404234 some of them will im sure will respect her wishes in that regard and some of them will have to think about it for a while
8404235 will cause tennesseans who were reluctant to jump on board
8404236 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8404237 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8404238 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8404239 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8404240 these data demonstrate that treatment with velcade plus melphalan and prednisone leads to a survival benefit and a high complete remission in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma
8404241 the combination of velcade plus melphalan and prednisone is an important new option for these patients
8404242 we are proud to have these data published in such a highly esteemed journal
8404243 were delighted that previously untreated multiple myeloma patients now can benefit from this velcade based therapy as have patients in the relapsed and refractory settings since 2003
8404244 the tolerability of vcmp also was encouraging and side effects were generally manageable with appropriate supportive care and dose reduction as needed
8404245 im sure you remember a girl from kansas who said theres no place like home
8404246 well in john mccains version theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8404247 from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt now theres a pattern here barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbitt ran for president and he lost now speaking for myself and for at least this next election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8404248 john mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been a part of the middle class and i would say to him sen mccain its time for your wake up call because we just cant afford more of the same
8404249 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8404250 the question in this race is which of the candidates will make the change that will restore the promise of america is it john mccain no im shocked maybe thats because john mccain continues to claim that president bushs policies have been great for the economy in 2007 john mccain voted with the administration 95 of the time so if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous
8404251 even if you drilled in all of john mccains backyards including the ones he cant even remember
8404252 it wont be won with yesterdays ideas and yesterdays divisions and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need we need barack obama as the next president of the united states
8404253 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8404254 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8404255 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8404256 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8404257 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8404258 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8404259 nor have i hugged madigan nor have i hugged emil
8404260 let me be perfectly clear i have not hugged frank
8404261 ok let the record reflect that the governor reached out to the tribune to give them a hug god bless rick pearson hes just as skeptical and rough and tumble as he always is
8404262 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8404263 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8404264 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8404265 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8404266 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8404267 paoli station is one of septas busiest passenger facilities outside of center city as travel patterns and rider preferences have changed the need has grown for a modern station that serves those who live and work in chester county congressmen gerlachs and sestaks support for this vital septa transportation center is greatly appreciated and we look forward to working with them to serve our shared constituents
8404268 you may even feel a slight tingle that is you feeling the aliveness of your body
8404269 better because i know if i say it then i am simply creating a sense of identity in reference to this new ideology new way

8404271 upon direction from the u s attorneys office in the district of columbia asd will not be able to move funds into company accounts or out of them we will work to resolve this problem and return to normal operation as soon as we are permitted to do so
8404272 i went to an asd meeting last thursday night it was my first introduction to this company in the company presentation it was said that 100 000 people are current members membership fees are 100 00 per month per member that equates to revenue to the company of 120 million per year
8404273 asd adds 0 25 to every dollar invested and pays back to the account 1 per day for a maximum of 125 in other words if you buy an ad packet for 1000 they add 250 to it and your account receives 12 50 for 125 days or about 4 months for a total of 1562 50
8404274 if the 100 000 members were in it for only 1 000 asd would be paying out a cool 169 million per year
8404275 so asd has got to come up with multiple billions per year to pay these members
8404276 how do they do it well when asked that question asd responded by saying that it sells advertising to corporations plus member dues of 120 million per year i dont think so i find it highly unlikely that they are covering their costs this way
8404277 no less an investment contract merely because the investor contributes some effort as well as money to get into it
8404278 just has sic meetings in dc and met with the president and vice president and received some honors in relationship to what asd is all about
8404279 good piece david im proud of you the article was terrific i know someone who invested 10 thousand she says she has gotten 4 thousand back and could have gotten more had she not reinvested whatever the hell that means asd could be the greatest thing since peas in a can but without full disclosure how can anyone know i suspect that perhaps very few people have actually received more than 100 on their asd investments the whole idea of ponzi schemes is to keep everyone in a form of suspended animation selling others and reinvesting while waiting for his or her own ship to come in if this is a ponzi and i hope it is not its among the most clever ive seen
8404280 earn rebates up to 100 percent of their ad cost
8404281 people are buying these ad packages with the hopes and dreams of big pay offs
8404282 you are paid 5 percent up to 10 percent commission on all ad sales banner ad sales and ebook sales you make personally you are paid 3 percent up to 5 percent commission on all ad sales banner ad sales and ebooks sales made by the advertisers you recommended
8404283 an advertiser may pay a monthly membership fee and reduce cash out fees increase referral commissions and decrease the number of sites to view on a daily basis
8404284 if you do not pay a membership fee you will be paid a 3 percent referral commission on all of your personal sales only when you pay a 10 per month membership fee you earn a 5 percent referral commission on your personal sales and 3 percent on your second level sales when you pay a 25 per month membership fee you earn a 7 percent referral commission on your personal sales and 4 percent on your second level sales when you pay a 100 per month membership fee you earn a 10 percent referral commission on your personal sales and 5 percent on your second level sales this can mean a tremendous amount of income to you and you decide which is right for you
8404285 if you buy a 10 000 ad package you get 10 000 ad credits which earns you 100 a day for 125 days thus in 25 days you would get back 12 500 thats a 2 500 profit
8404286 as far as i know there is a running promotion on the web site that agrees to match your ad package credits investment at 1 25 times the amount
8404287 so 10 000 gets you 12 500 x 125 days which is 15 625 a profit of 5 625
8404288 at all previous conventions they offered promotions to double ad package credits to the purchasers and also match the amount to the person who initiated the sale in addition the immediate up leg gets 10 percent commission and 5 percent to next up leg
8404289 so 10 000 gets the purchaser 20 000 in ad credits and the up leg guy gets 10 000 in ad credits as well this creates insurmountable accounting issues in addition asd receives 50 percent of all revenue generated this is the whole reason why the myth of riches and pay offs continues to be perpetuated even though there is no money left to pay out
8404290 take the last convention in tampa as an example that gathered 40 million in purchased ad credits asd gets 20 million off the top commissions are paid at 10 percent to the first leg and trickles up to total 11 1 percent paid commissions commissions are paid at 5 percent to the second leg which also trickles up to equal 5 5 percent to reach a grand total of 6 6 million in commissions paid of the total cash 40 million gathered 20 million goes to asd and 6 6 million goes to commissions which leaves only 13 4 million to be distributed towards payments promised to ad credits
8404291 ad credits are 40 x 2 for the double promotion plus 40 million for the match up leg promotion which equals 120 million paid at 1 2 million a day for 125 days they can only pay these people for about 11 days with the cash on hand from my best research there have been five conferences conventions in about 30 days which have offered double promotions
8404292 by the time the asd conference hits tulsa the company could be 1 billion upside down i dont see how anyone in tulsa could get their money back out of this program in fact the odds are that no one even as early as saturday in miami could get their money back out
8404293 the argument from asd is that they have additional streams of income by requiring ad purchasers to surf asd asserts this activity creates value however given the promised payouts outside revenue is irrelevant insignificant and appears to be no more than a smokescreen
8404294 asd charges one dollar for each ad package and each ad package includes one credit one credit equals one showing of your web site or the web site of your choice in my best assessment the market value for one hit on your web site is 1 cent or less which is less than one percent of what people are paying for each ad package furthermore the vast majority of the purchasers of asd ad packages that i know are using somebody elses web site and dont have any intention of utilizing the advertising services
8404295 all payments made to asd are considered advertising purchases not investments or deposits of any kind all sales are final asd does not guarantee any earnings and or rebates all rebates paid to advertisers are for the service of viewing other advertisers web sites all commissions are for referring advertisers to asd all advertising purchases are non refundable after the passing of the 3 days right of rescission
8404296 if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
8404297 the new ach cash out process for u s members should be online hopefully tomorrow and the office will be back on track with cash outs there was a delay with cash outs while this new service was put into place to replace direct deposit cash outs also bank of america will now be handling the live check cash outs for asd asd will send the information to bank of america and they will print and mail out the checks for us now there was training involved with the bank of america folks teaching the asd accounting people how to do the new ach process all of these new processes played into the delay of recent cash outs again please be as patient as you can
8404298 please make sure that you have a w 9 submitted to the asd office u s members only prior to requesting a cash out also you must make sure that your name on your asd web site is exactly the same as what you have on your w 9 if there is even the slightest difference then your cash out will not go through

8404360 that bradman made a century on average every time he batted is remarkable in itself but to realise his batting average is virtually twice as high as anyone who played test cricket for any length of time shows why he is one of sports great stories

8404456 before he debates obama john mccain should finish the debate for himself

8404459 too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8404460 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8404461 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8404462 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8404463 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8404464 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama

8404466 i love you but we have important work to do tonight
8404467 we cannot afford once again to make the wrong choice or to be taken in by the politics of fear
8404468 denver is where i grew up believing in the american dream and in a country that more than any other is associated with truth justice and freedom
8404469 the opportunity is too great and the stakes too high to allow president obamas agenda to be blocked by the special interests and their allies in the senate
8404470 with eyes firmly fixed on the future with the spirit of unity lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our next president
8404471 my fellow democrats my fellow americans i have never seen a moment like this i have never seen my country as energized as this
8404472 i cant tell you what an honor it is to be here today nominating barack obama and the next president of the united states
8404473 i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength wisdom and courage to talk to our enemies who will respect our veterans when they get back home instead of letting them languish without the medical care they deserve
8404474 no matter who you are no matter where youre from anything is possible in our america
8404475 another mother instilled that same dream in her son barack obama
8404476 for barack obama that dream runs deep in his soul
8404477 a president who will make sure that no matter who you are no matter where youre from you too can work hard to achieve the american dream
8404478 i am a proud new yorker a proud woman of color and a proud supporter of hillary rodham clinton
8404479 hillarys values are the values of my family and my community
8404480 and theyre just getting sick and tired of the government intervening in their kids every time the kids turn around they got some whacko
8404481 to see what is in front of ones nose requires a constant struggle
8404482 duh duh duh duh duh duhhhhh d duh duhduhduhduhduh duh duh duh duh duhhhh duh
8404483 i dunno but i was just humming it a few minutes ago

8404485 we had a lot of feedback from the 2004 convention that activities during the day were pretty boring but that the bloggers enjoyed hanging out together
8404486 so we thought lets create a zone where we can do that once we started down that road the interest skyrocketed
8404487 i think four years ago in boston there was nothing just a conference room with a couple of crates of beer and wifi
8404488 democratic national comittee chairman howard dean told us yesterday that we had better access than the mainstream media and i actually think thats true
8404489 were getting access to the podium to the floor there really arent many places that are off limits
8404490 a lot of people find the traditional media very stale very programmed
8404491 our readers are looking for something more than a 30 second soundbite on important issues
8404492 blogs have become important because theres been a declining trust in the mainstream media particularly in the lack of hard hitting reporting in the run up to the iraq war
8404493 that combined with the new availability of tools that allows anyone to publish and create their own audience which didnt exist before
8404494 i had to take my paid time off to come here
8404495 ive pretty much exhausted my allowance for the whole year im going to have to take unpaid leave for the rest of the year if i want to travel but fortunately my employer is supportive
8404496 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8404497 he is not who he portrays himself to be he is not a maverick hes a clone of george bush he votes with him 95 percent of the time
8404498 harry reids attacks on john mccain fall somewhere between desperate and pathetic reflecting the type of passive aggressive weak leadership that earned congress a 19 percent approval rating
8404499 barack obamas own running mate knows hes not qualified to be commander in chief but said hed be honored to run with john mccain on a presidential ticket
8404500 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with

8404504 um wow thats just a piece of metal on a ribbon that i will never ever wear again
8404505 two things about which i feel passionate at least for today
8404506 were swimming in a sea of information and there are very few life preservers
8404507 people feel overloaded but theyre not doing the math and saying i have 2 000 people in my department
8404508 making strict rules isnt the issues work habits are the issue you can train people to use technologies differently
8404509 you have to let your inbox be the slave of your priorities not the other way around
8404510 use it only at times where it makes sense to use it
8404511 i feel great anger at the taking of the life of mr ito who had high aspirations and had worked for and walked among the local people
8404512 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8404513 the sight of russian tanks in a neighboring country on the 40th anniversary of the crushing of the prague spring has shown that the temptations of power politics remain
8404514 military ships are hardly a common way to deliver such aid
8404515 can nato which is not a state located in the black sea continuously increase its group of forces and systems there it turns out that it cannot
8404516 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8404517 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8404518 i am so glad this is over justice has been served
8404519 this defendant uses the time that he has to think out these plans and he is dangerous
8404520 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8404521 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again

8404606 but much of the death penalty system remains unaffected by this hold on executions
8404607 prosecutions trials appeals and the rituals of death row continue to absorb an enormous share of the judicial systems time and resources justices from some of the states highest courts have complained about the extraordinary strain this one issue places on the bench in many states there are not enough qualified lawyers willing to handle the appeals

8404638 until i see an economic impact study with the benefits for the city of franklin i will not vote on this proposal
8404639 someone needs to figure out the benefit increase for each community

8404653 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8404654 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8404655 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good

8404667 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her own body
8404668 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
8404669 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
8404670 that was immature and irresponsible on your part but i accept that you were not acting as a predator
8404671 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
8404672 you are unlikely to offend again and the relationship is now over
8404673 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
8404674 repeating this abuse taking advantage of it to repeatedly rape her doesnt mitigate the harm done it compounds it

8404678 umbrella schools this possibility is increasingly necessary given the high demand for mobility of many families german children only have this option if they are abroad are famous eg kaulitz brothers from the youth band tokio hotel or have failed school completely flexible correspondence school flex fernschule in baden wuerttemberg or individual internet school web individualschule in bochum 100 success rate an expansion of educational opportunities in germany to include these other forms of education that fulfill the school attendance requirement would not only help these families but also those presently emigrating unfortunately due to the duress of forced school attendance they would also create healthy competition and so help our schools quickly take stock in which good and enthusiastic learning happens a monopoly has never increased quality the excellent results of alternative learners in learning and socialization are clearly documented in many studies from different countries except germany unjustified criminalization of complimentary learning does not lead to a a stemming of successful learning but instead to a migration abroad of these families interested in this learning pedagogy we have the impression that the resistance of the national authorities is mainly due to ignorance about the international situation and unsubstantiated prejudices about the implications of backtracking the law we would like to change this and so we ask here on the occasion of the education summit and the run up to it to give the possibility due consideration nachname beruf funktion strasse plz ort ihre e mail ver ffentlichung auf dieser website ja nein first name surname occupation position this is optional street number and name postcode town your email address notice undefined property shortdesc in home sevdoves public html skins edgy index main php on line 162 tags notice undefined property keytags in home sevdoves public html skins edgy index main php on line notice undefined property shortdesc in home sevdoves public html skins edgy index main php notice undefined property shortdesc in home sevdoves public html skins edgy index main php on line 166 amp tags notice undefined property keytags in home sevdoves public html skins edgy index main php on line undefined property keytags in home sevdoves public html skins edgy index main php on line 174 amp doctitle sign the open letter to the educational summit amp url http educatinggermany 7doves com 2008 08 28 summit

8404697 were a very visible commodity whenever there are issues in the u s russia relationship
8404698 i would be surprised if we found ourselves out of themarket overnight i dont think thats going to happen
8404699 neither the club nor him have a justification for this absence the only thing we can see is that valencia does not want to represent the ecuadorian national team
8404700 if he didnt join the team because he is scared of being excluded from the wigan starting line up its unacceptable
8404701 valencia should have joined the national team without making excuses he was the one who decided not to play against colombia
8404702 our friendly was played on a date fifa set aside for these types of games and regulations must be followed
8404703 there is an impressive squad and i think its the best team of the last four years
8404704 now we are about to start a new season and i hope that we can say in the future the sevilla of this year is the best of all time
8404705 the image of the club had deteriorated we had to restore involvement in and commitment to the club and thats why i thought of josep guardiola
8404706 he has a perfect understanding of the club a methodology and a respect for attractive football which makes him the best choice to manage the team i dont think anyone can doubt the decision to appoint guardiola as manager of barca
8404707 running every red light to get to headquarters to file a complaint

8404719 i havent had the opportunity to take any calls since we landed in denmark so im sure there will be an update waiting for me
8404720 but until i get that i cant give any more news
8404721 were obviously keen to bring him to the club if we can if the opportunity presents itself well try to pursue it but were not further down the road as yet
8404722 the situation before we flew was the same it may have moved forward or it may have gone backwards but until i put the call in i wont know
8404723 he wright phillips doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8404724 because of all the problems there city and the uncertainty surrounding the place he is unsure
8404725 he is speaking with the manager luiz felipe scolari at the moment but he is settled in london he would like to stay and thats the bottom line but it is up to the manager
8404726 we are looking at all the options really at this moment in time so i cant really say much more
8404727 if it doesnt happen it wont be for want of trying
8404728 hes a player that i know obviously i worked with him at blackburn and wales so i know what he could offer us
8404729 but i think west ham came out yesterday quite strongly in their response to any interest that anybody has shown
8404730 i am proud that other clubs have wanted me it is clear that they needed to negotiate with valencia
8404731 valencia refused money and instead opted to keep me and im proud of that
8404732 it is a very happy day for me in the last month and a half lots of things have happened around me that i have not experienced before
8404733 i want to thank valencia for this gesture i am very grateful to this club for what they have given me and i hope to continue to give good performances
8404734 we announce today that david villa and valencia will remain together for many years to come
8404735 in our club we need men like david villa not only for his sporting abilities but for the respect he has shown to our club and our fans
8404736 i hope this will be a clear message to other clubs and our executives that we will not be intimidated by anyone valencia will fight to continue to be a big club

8404754 the anchor had no idea what she was talking about
8404755 i am not telling you what to do youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8404756 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour

8404759 what is the strangest outreach situation you have ever encountered
8404760 okay ill listen but dont expect me to believe it
8404761 we dont have a lot of time to unite the democratic party
8404762 that which historically divides us cannot divide us if we want barack obama to be president of the united states
8404763 barack needs illinoisans to love each other then he needs us to leave our front row seats and go hug ohio go hug michigan go hug florida
8404764 i am not going to be satisfied until i see rod blagojevich give mike madigan a hug

8404768 he was supposed to be jumping on a plane to get up here francona said
8404769 i think hes supposed to arrive at laguardia around like 5 10 and that probably gets him here around 11 30
8404770 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes like everybodys all time favorite francona said of kotsay
8404771 i know hes a real professional and that hes real excited about coming here and he said hed do anything we asked to try and help us win
8404772 well talk to him about that but the one thing ive heard about him is that if he can walk hell play ive heard that from numerous people
8404773 i just think theo thought getting a guy like kotsay certainly cant hurt our chances
8404774 one thing well continue to do is monitor every day and always reserve the right to do what we think is in his best interest and ours but i think hes doing ok
8404775 im happy to verify but im sure my name doesnt yet carry enough weight to give it substance

8404788 were staying at the denver tech center its in japan
8404789 its the hotel shuttle then the light rail then walk walk walk
8404790 we have delegation meetings at the hotel at 9 a m then at 10 a m they give out credentials for guests like spouses and by that time ive missed the caucus meetings
8404791 its important because we get together with other latinos and hear whats going on denver was a great choice but they need to have the delegations close in
8404792 frankly its forced me to be very selective about what i attend once i leave the pepsi center do i really want to get on a shuttle and go somewhere or do i want to go back to the hotel

8404809 but we want people to know there are certain portions of new orleans that still need help the gentilly neighborhood included

8404811 our million dollar club members are truly the stars of usana so we wanted to give them the star treatment
8404812 through hard work dedication and entrepreneurial spirit these associates have shown that great things can be achieved through a usana home based business
8404813 id roll into a hotel room at three in the afternoon and i wouldnt talk to another person until nine the next morning
8404814 it was incredibly lonely theres always a side of the job that most people dont anticipate and that was the one for me it was definitely a struggle all the way through
8404815 it was a really good time for god to teach me about myself and who he is
8404816 god has always spoken to me through community so it was very difficult learning how to seek god and hear from him in a new way i had to be very intentional it was a stretch
8404817 one of my biggest fears has been being alone going into a situation where i know nobody where i have to make friends or i have to go into a situation where i can get rejected
8404818 its ok to be alone its ok to not be doing something with someone all the time that has been a gift to me
8404819 the day after i was crowned one of my judges told me theres no complaining
8404820 at that point this was something i had been praying for and i was thinking im miss north dakota holy smokes im not going to complain at all but as the year went on i understood it better it was incredibly important for me to believe in my heart
8404821 i would have days and days and days where i would be in two or three towns in a day and be in two or three schools in each of those towns
8404822 the joy i was given in my job overwhelmed everything else im there because im miss north dakota and i get to speak into the lives of a lot of students
8404823 i changed the focus from going in as miss north dakota and that i was going to enlighten these kids
8404824 i decided i was going to go in as ashley young and i have something to say and by the way im miss north dakota but thats not why im here im here to challenge you
8404825 the older kids are usually turned off by speakers but especially by miss north dakota because they think shes just a beauty queen a dumb blonde coming in to talk to us
8404826 when those students could view young as a person they became more responsive
8404827 i cant even explain how much ive been changed by boys and girls older kids talking of their bullying experience that led to thoughts of suicide
8404828 she looked at me for a little while and she started to tear up and i could tell it was something really deep to her and i didnt understand why until she said i think that was my son
8404829 the teacher then thanked young for her compassion and work
8404830 i never expected to bump into this boys mom but it just provided validity for what i was doing
8404831 people might say all sorts of things about you but the only thing that matters is what jesus christ has said and done for you he has shown you what your value is
8404832 i felt so humbled that god would expand my influence so far outside my own state
8404833 i went through most of my life except for perhaps the last couple of months thinking that i have no beauty that im not desirable by man or by god at times
8404834 if you wear these clothes then youll be beautiful if you wear your hair this way thats what real beauty is
8404835 for a while my heart got sucked into that and i was so focused on this outward beauty that was so shallow and so hollow and it left me so cold
8404836 its not a finished process by any means but over the last couple of months god has really broken me
8404837 this past year has taught me to be at peace with whatever season of life god puts me in
8404838 if you talk to anyone who knows me they will tell you thats very hard for me because its not natural for me im always looking five years into the future
8404839 how do i find god in the present how do i find any sense of fulfillment where i am how do i find a sense of purpose where i am
8404840 its a huge stretch its more difficult than it sounds

8404871 weber sees no need for the european central bank to lower interest rates any time soon and said the ecb should consider raising interest rates when the european economy strengthens toward the end of this year
8404872 adds to the still nascent optimism that the us economy may be turning the corner
8404873 even so it is still too early to sound the all clear and activity and sentiment indicators remain vulnerable to any deterioration in the news flow surrounding the ongoing credit crisis banking sector problems and housing market woes

8404877 before we conducted these analyses we knew based on evidence from previous studies that we might expect acceleration in decline on cognitive abilities before death
8404878 and our findings clearly showed there to be a pattern of terminal decline even among relatively healthy individuals that the brain changes that influence our cognitive abilities in old age occur over a relatively long period of time even among individuals who remain non demented until they die
8404879 typically when you ask the question how does mental function change with age the older you get its easy to mix up people who are merely old with people who are in fact dying
8404880 illustrates very clearly that there is a certain period before death from so called natural causes where mental function declines at an accelerating pace and while most investigators had thought that this kind of decline begins between three to five years before death this study shows that it in fact can be traced back to a starting point that is a lot earlier than previously thought
8404881 after thorough evaluation weve concluded that a reverse stock split is the best alternative to comply with nasdaqs minimum bid requirements and to ensure that our stock continues to trade on the nasdaq global market

8404883 this highly conditional expression of interest attributed a 90 million value to gold reserves equity which the board determined was inadequate and not in the best interests of shareholders for example the expression of interest did not take into account gold reserves current financial position and gave little value for our companys proven and probable reserves of 10 2 million ounces of gold and 1 4 billion pounds of copper the mobile cat equipment the equipment currently being manufactured the extensive intangibles attached to the brisas project and the value of the choco 5 exploration property our objective is to enhance shareholder value and in that regard we are always willing to discuss any potential opportunities to achieve that objective

8404893 were proud to carry on our tradition of being the little eagan school that brings in the big name bands such as kansas and davy jones we heard a lot of buzz from septemberfest fans who said theyd like to see the bodeans so were thrilled to have them join our event this year we know this year will offer music fans another fun high quality event and thats a huge credit to the many school parents who volunteer their time and expertise to plan manage and run this excellent music festival each year
8404894 the fat cells we found in our obese patients were deficient in several areas
8404895 they showed significant stress on the endoplasmic reticulum and the tissue itself was more inflamed than in our lean patients
8404896 seven variables can be combined into a convenient risk scoring system before coronary angiography is performed to predict in hospital mortality following pci
8404897 this model may be useful in providing patients with individualized evidence based estimates of procedural risk as part of the informed consent process before pci
8404898 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8404899 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8404900 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8404901 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8404902 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8404903 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8404904 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8404905 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8404906 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8404907 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8404908 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8404909 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8404910 collectively these studies highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by sirna based therapies
8404911 a third of all cases of cerebral palsy are associated with preterm birth
8404912 this study shows a significant reduction in cerebral palsy among preterm infants whose mothers were given magnesium sulfate
8404913 our study is the largest most comprehensive effort to date that looked at using this inexpensive and commonly used treatment to reduce the occurrence of cerebral palsy after preterm birth
8404914 cerebral palsy cant always be prevented but the data from our study and its predecessors will help obstetricians make informed treatment decisions for the women under their care
8404915 our results show that obstetricians can use magnesium sulfate which they have experience prescribing to reduce the risk of a devastating condition cerebral palsy in preterm infants
8404916 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8404917 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8404918 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8404919 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8404920 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8404921 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8404922 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8404923 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
8404924 clearly the statement that were not all the same is not exactly novel and yet im still struck by how homogenized people become when it comes to clinical trials
8404925 gavins experience as an it solutions provider has helped him keep the customers perspective at the forefront and his most recent position at avnet has given him a solid track record of dealing with multiple suppliers
8404926 that broad range of experience will be well utilized in his new role we continue to see strong demand for technology solutions that optimize or expand existing it infrastructures and gavin has the skills and the team to capture these growth opportunities
8404927 over the past three years the axiom capital management livingston nanotechnology conference has emerged as an important gathering for the investment community and pioneers in the area of nanotechnology
8404928 im excited to be presenting at scott livingstons new event with a focus on the tremendous opportunities for nanotechnology in the field of healthcare and life science
8404929 our healthcare amp life sciences summit has been designed to bring together key stakeholders from pharmaceutical capital investment business strategy and federal science and regulatory segments
8404930 due to its exclusive nature we can assure that in addition to helping attendees identify key trends the event will provide for significant opportunities among participants for deal making
8404931 we needed a backup solution that was able to work with different varieties of linux including red hat enterprise linux
8404932 with netvault backup we are able to backup our diverse environment no other vendor has been able to adapt to the operating systems and applications we run and provide us with quick recoveries especially at the enterprise level recoveries that used to take half a day to complete now only take minutes
8404933 bakbone provides a system that we dont have to babysit
8404934 its a set and forget kind of process when we are recovering data we dont have to monitor the situation we know it is working and will not let us down this gives us more time to handle other issues in our work space
8404935 we were able to download and test the product from the web site very quickly other solutions dont provide this kind of service not only was it easy to install i was able to train new employees on the software quickly allowing me more time to work on other projects
8404936 flexible and easy to use data management is a critical element in it environments
8404937 with easy to install backup solutions we can help end users quickly launch recoveries and focus on other projects with netvault backup it administrators can confidently run recoveries within minutes without monitoring the situation
8404938 it is never too early or too late to save for college
8404939 if you are going to save for college it is important to consider a college savings plan and let your savings compound on a tax deferred basis
8404940 ugift is a great way to involve family and friends in the college savings process
8404941 using their social network parents grandparents and others now have additional help in achieving their college savings goals
8404942 during a secondary screening process she was found in possession of what appeared to about a small amount of heroin and cocaine

8404956 how can he call an agm for the simple reason that the ihf doesnt exist at present i dont think there will be any response to his call
8404957 though the mha committee will sit and decide i personally think that every state association should go for the meeting the reason i say this is because the ad hoc committee has alienated the state associations

8404971 i see myself in these kids somewhere among them will be the next vijender and i hope i can motivate them enough there was a time in my career when id lost motivation and i am hopeful that our performance in these olympics will cheer these boxers
8404972 at times i wonder where the last 15 days have ticked by the time before the olympics was spent in training and most of the time we were travelling in fact im heading home for the first time in two months
8404973 i remember i used to see the image of the olympic rings on the walls of the sai boxing centre while going to school my brother manoj and i often used to wonder what those rings meant it was only later that we got to know about them we used to share gloves and it was only in 1998 when manoj joined the army that i got my own pair of gloves
8404974 beijing is history now and i want to concentrate on the future the commonwealth games will provide me a platform in india and a chance to prove my worth in front of my countrymen

8404994 no well intentioned person can doubt that argentina is going to meet each and every one of its commitments
8404995 argentina is a friendly country to people who want to come and invest
8404996 its even more friendly for those whove put in a dollar and want to keep putting in more dollars because that generates work for argentines
8404997 nowhere is that more important than in the middle east which increasingly has come to be defined in terms of the arab israeli equation for reasons we dont fully understand
8404998 illegal immigrants were trying to get jobs in the saudi bordering cities
8404999 tridium is committed to the on going development and support of the niagara community throughout asia pacific
8405000 the niagara forum is the only gathering of its kind dedicated to the advancement of niagara in the region no other event brings together such a range of practitioners using the niagara framework its the only place to share in this unique experience
8405001 what is this ground that we are standing on with faith voters compared to 04 who are these new values voters
8405002 the tradition from which i come has a holistic perspective
8405003 the voters have been way ahead of the elite dialogue in either party for a long time
8405004 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
8405005 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
8405006 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
8405007 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
8405008 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
8405009 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
8405010 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
8405011 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
8405012 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
8405013 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
8405014 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
8405015 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees
8405016 every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
8405017 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
8405018 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word
8405019 in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
8405020 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
8405021 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought
8405022 it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
8405023 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
8405024 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
8405025 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
8405026 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavor are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
8405027 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
8405028 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
8405029 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelt the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir
8405030 so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
8405031 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
8405032 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
8405033 smart meters make a real difference in the energy sector
8405034 consumers gain control over surging energy costs governments get chance to promote energy conservation and the energy industry players are able to become more efficient
8405035 germany did not go all the way with the recent energy and climate act an unclear regulatory framework and uncertainty about the future threaten to further delay adoption of smart metering in the country
8405036 if the british government is honest about its commitment to reducing carbon emissions it really has no other alternative than to push ahead with smart metering for all energy customers
8405037 this initiative will provide seamless application integration using zigbee or homeplug devices providing the flexibility utilities need when implementing ami and smart metering programs
8405038 mainstream market adoption of a common technology accelerates our ability to empower our customers to manage their energy usage
8405039 the integration of a common application layer across these technologies will allow a common certification process which is critical for plug and play interoperability
8405040 without such integration it will not be possible to scale energy efficiency applications and services
8405041 zigbee smart energy was developed by utility companies product manufacturers and technology suppliers so it makes perfect sense to leverage that collaboration
8405042 expediting the rollout of energy management and efficiency programs that help everyone better manage their energy use is our common goal and the zigbee alliance is proud to play a key role in this process
8405043 with more than 20 million homeplug enabled products in use on six continents homeplug technology is the leading global standard for power line networks
8405044 as utilities and access providers aggressively deploy homeplug technology in applications around the world for electric grid management automatic meter reading applications and demand response bpl and command and control applications continue to be a driving force for the alliance
8405045 i didnt play quite as well as i did in the first round
8405046 didnt find my rhythm but sometimes you just have to get through these matches
8405047 in the first set i went out there but i had no clue how she would play
8405048 she plays the ball really flat and fast so for me it was all about the first set i realised i had to go more to the forehand because on her backhand she was making good shots
8405049 i am completely out of breath i was pushed to the limit
8405050 the last time i played her she was 5 1 up in the third set and i had to come back
8405051 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8405052 rob has been instrumental in support of sias government relations programs and initiatives
8405053 his extraordinary leadership has positioned sia to address the public policy challenges impacting the electronic physical security industry
8405054 we believe that a strong healthy security industry is critical to homeland security
8405055 the involvement of hirschs leadership and expertise contributes to the industrys strength and ultimately provides our clients with insight into evolving security standards regulations development technologies and innovative applications
8405056 were proud to be serving this years us open with clean wind generated energy
8405057 by matching their electricity usage with renewable energy the usta and other sports associations across america are helping to lead the effort to address the environmental and energy challenges we face around the globe
8405058 big time sporting events provide a unique platform to educate our fans on green initiatives and we feel that the best way we can educate is to lead by example
8405059 we have a plan that will lessen the environmental impact of the event and heighten the environmental awareness of those who attend it
8405060 hang on lets make sure that we dont wreck our economy for a largely symbolic gesture
8405061 oh yes that would be the reason why theres been no global warming in the last ten years and 2008 is the coldest year this century
8405062 the principal reason is la nina part of the natural cycle that also includes el nino which cools the globe
8405063 global warming stopped in 1998 has become a recent mantra of those who wish to deny the reality of human caused global warming

8405073 with three medals in its kitty including a gold in individual events could the 2008 beijing olympic games be a turning point for indian sports with wrestler sushil kumar getting the country a bronze in wrestling after a gap of 56 years and boxer vijender kumar having qualified for the semifinals what a day it has been for indian sport this august 20 for ironically it was on this day that the indian cricketers won the second one day international cricket against sri lanka
8405074 ironically the hosts and our neighbours china dominated the show pushing the superpower of sports usa to second spot by winning the highest number of medals surely a lesson in this for this country that it is time we started encouraging sportsmen and not just all the time focussing on the men in flannels or the men in blue as our cricketers have come to be known
8405075 at last the upa government has declared that the simi is a terrorist outfit with links with other islamic terror outfits and that it is waging a war against the indian state in this the centre has requested the gujarat government to share the proof it has accumulated in connection with the terror attacks in ahmedabad and surat
8405076 the centre in an elaborate mass of evidence provided before the supreme court to press the ban on the outfit which has been found to be increasingly involved in terrorist attacks and anti india activities said that simi was spreading the message of jehad and at the same time extended full support to extremists and terrorists in j amp k and punjab and have been involved in various militant and disruptive activities in maharashtra kerala up and tamil nadu the hard hitting affidavit on simi this time is designed to overcome the loss of face it suffered when the unlawful activities prevention tribunal on august 6 turned down the ban citing incoherent and insufficient evidence submitted by the home ministry
8405077 the bjp chief minister of gujarat accomplished what no other state government could in all these years modi led from the front in the process he set an example before the nation that the terrorist shenanigans cannot hoodwink the commitment of a zealous patriot
8405078 there may be features that mark values that ought to be honored in ones choices rather than promoted by ones choices off from other values but why do those features matter so much that question typically goes unconsidered by non consequentialists not only do they have a duality then where consequentialists have a unity they also have an unexplained duality
8405079 it was never contended or conceived by a sound orthodox utilitarian that the lover should kiss his mistress with an eye to the common weal
8405080 opcti is regularly asked to explain what impact the ua spec has on industry
8405081 people are confused and are looking for answers the role of the opc training institute is to provide answers and help end users and integrators understand the ins and outs of opc technology
8405082 but i do not think my parents would appreciate it
8405083 the lady id most love to 69 with candace has such a gorgeous mouth and i am sure she has the ability to give a world class deep throat and she has the juiciest and most mouthwatering pussy id be honored to give her pleasure with my tongue to experience both giving and receiving oral pleasure with candace at the same time would be a memorable experience
8405084 what i said at the time even at the time of the debate in the surge was that when you put 30 000 american troops in of course its going to have an impact theres no doubt about that
8405085 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse i think it takes pressure off the iraqis to arrive at the sort of political accommodation that every observer believes is the ultimate solution to the problems we face there so i am going to actively oppose the presidents proposal
8405086 the media is conducting the trial with the help of the police
8405087 you give the confessional statement to the press but not to the accused
8405088 a police officer was found guilty of contempt by stating at an organised media conference that a suspect had admitted committing the murders with which he was charged
8405089 that a junta of police officers and journalists can hold a sort of preliminary setting of the issues likely to be raised at the hearing
8405090 it is a serious contempt to publish the criminal record of an accused or to comment on the previous bad character of the accused before trial similarly publication of a confession to a crime made by an accused out of court even if the confession is true is a serious contempt of court

8405116 the note restricts henceforth the circulation of diplomats inside the country a measure being interpreted in some circles as a way of limiting the observation by them of what might be happening outside the capital during the electoral campaign according to the document the notified who might wish to travel outside luanda must inform the mirex of that intention at least three working days in advance the ministry argues that the measure aims at allowing the angolan government to fulfill its obligation to protect all inhabitants of the national territory particularly the diplomatic agents according to sources the issue was discussed during a meeting between the external relations minister joao miranda and the united states ambassador dan mozena the ambassador is said to have expressed his reservations about the measure but was reassured by the minister that its only objective was to provide an adequate protocol treatment to the diplomatic personnel however the note contains passages that dont seem as comforting as the minister claims for example it refers to article 41 of the vienna convention according to which without prejudice to their privileges and immunities the diplomatic agents as well as having the duty to respect the laws and regulations of the accredited state must not interfere in its internal affairs this particular passage is taken by many as a serious warning to the foreign embassies which have usually taken positions whenever elections in african countries have unpleasant outcomes as happened recently in kenya and zimbabwe in an interview to the nj last july dan mozena said emphatically that his mission would be with an eye in the angolan elections

8405118 in relation to the constitution of the list for future members of the national assembly mps i have to say that once again our glorious mpla demonstrated that in terms of transparency and democracy it is the worst party last saturday the luanda provincial committee of the mpla called a meeting with the directorships of the provinces action committees the party bases in spite of not having been informed beforehand of the reasons for the meeting attended in mass however the meeting was pure and simply aimed at misleading the militants when the lists had already been made since march april the bases also became aware that the list for the national circle is equally very doubtful and doesnt have any technical professional credibility within the various action committees in luandas urban areas there are militants who sacrifice a lot in their work for the mpla and are holders of undergraduate and masters degrees among whom lawyers university teachers and electoral trainers with an enviable technical professional experience they are militants who have the mpla at heart and whose presence in those committees will guarantee the partys victory in the respective areas however it is sad to see that they were ignored in favour of mostly unknown faces thats why because of these injustices the mpla mobilised with the sacrifice and supported by the bases on polling day will see those same bases prefer to stay at home instead of voting for people that they dont know and did not select thats also why the militant if he chooses to vote will do so for the opposition which in spite of the past will probably have a better team for the national assembly comparatively to our mpla which is not concerned with the luanda vote because the victory will come from the provinces we only regret that the mpla continues to use the methods of the past and ignoring the fact that times have changed its always the same people who get nominated everything works on the basis of schemes and corruption when things are not done with transparency its a sign of corruption thats how the mpla even if unwillingly is campaigning for the opposition i have expressed my opinion here because if i express it at the meeting i will be silenced mistreated and perhaps killed when a militant cannot just say what he feels and if he does is taken as disgruntled and when one is disgruntled its a crime then its not possible to take these ideas to meetings thats how our mpla is
8405119 the ajpd alerts the angolan political community and the international community specially the national and international observers to the practices unacceptable in a democratic state of rights which have been occurring in the current electoral process namely the government of angolas permanent propaganda in the state media using the same narrative discourse of one of the contending parties in clear violation of the principle of equal treatment and opportunity the give aways to members of the electorate of goods such as bicycles and motorcycles by political parties and organisations affected to them during acts of political campaign with vote orientation the persistence of attempts to violate the laws applicable to the electoral process and the occasional political violence even if of low intensity and not generalised without the prompt charging of the responsible for such actions by the competent judicial and police bodies

8405298 this is an issue i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8405299 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins the catholic church for centuries has been discussing this and there are those whove decided
8405300 this year they are going to have to call me im just not sure i can vote for obama
8405301 i was really hoping that a few more guys would come along with us and we would have a better chance of staying away and setting up a bit of a gc general classification
8405302 but there was only four of us out there and unfortunately we lost two of them about halfway through so there was just me and the other aussie guy left out front he was really strong and we gave it a good shot
8405303 ive got a strong team here so im sure theyll help me defend it
8405304 glen was having serious sinus problems and had real difficulty breathing
8405305 maybe all the travel this month finally caught up to him
8405306 its a big disappointment especially since he would be very helpful trying to set matty up for the kom in the next couple of days but kobzarenko and moises aldape look good and i think they will all get stronger as the week goes on

8405310 jim crow was the law of land in order to survive you just learned what to do and how to work within the system
8405311 if the democrats cant convince the american public to vote for them then
8405312 this is probably the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a teenager
8405313 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all

8405317 xp clients dont automatically have the extended roots in them to see ev ssl
8405318 the next time you visit that site or any ev ssl site certified by verisign youll see the green bar
8405319 our solution is called the auto enhancer and it installs with the ssl certificate itself
8405320 all that an e merchant or the person maintaining their website needs to do is install this auto enhancer code along with their ssl certificate from that point on any site visitor coming to their site will automatically see the green address bar from the very first time they come to their site
8405321 were the only site in the industry that works with one quick install code on the server
8405322 it installs and maintains just like an ssl certificate which means it doesnt require any changes to individual web pages

8405329 makes no assumptions as to the tools you have at hand or the scope of your project all that is required is an internet connection to download the necessary packages browse specific online documentation and benefit from other developers experiences as well as share your own besides giving the greatest degree of freedom and control over your design this approach is closest to that followed by the pioneers who have spearheaded the way for linuxs use in embedded systems
8405330 theres enough background on firewire i o requirements distribution patent issues storage methods grub with diskonchip devices and other considerations to give even the most sophisticated developer a new lease on life if you are an experienced embedded system developer and you want to start using linux theres no other book for you
8405331 statistical concepts are often used and abused in the popular media
8405332 and the best defense is to become statistically literate also one or two semesters of statistics are a common requirement in many university majors and professionals often find that they need to learn statistics more or less on the job long after they thought their formal education was complete
8405333 if one thing is clear its that the future is mobile
8405334 the open source community is no longer the sole province of technology geeks the mood is shifting

8405337 its aggravating to us over 600 flights were affected which is about 60 000 people because of one computer glitch
8405338 we were doing a normal daily software load that we do a couple times a day
8405339 as we were doing the software load something got corrupted in the file and it brought the system down
8405340 this is one of the largest project management challenges the u s government has had since we put somebody on the moon

8405353 i wish we could roll back gas prices to 1955 when dad worked on the bridge but thats not going to happen
8405354 it costs you extra money to do anything today the price of fuel has certainly affected my other travel plans we dont travel like we did before it used to be that you didnt hesitate to go up to northern michigan but weve curbed it quite a bit this year its gotten so a tank of gas exceeds the cost of the motel room
8405355 while the overall travel numbers are down slightly from last year it is important to note that more michigan residents are spending their vacation dollars in michigan
8405356 i guess when it comes to gas prices my philosophy is that it is what it is and its out of my control
8405357 im fortunate in that it doesnt impact me where it might impact other families the way i see it family memories are more important to us than the added expense of gasoline
8405358 i think its realistic weve talked with a lot of people to get their views of what their employees can do
8405359 theres universal recognition that this is a challenging time for many but many of our businesses are doing well and we think theres a lot of potential for continued support of united way

8405363 during the great depression hoover raised the top marginal rate to 63 from 25 and hiked corporate taxes too says michael aronstein chief investment strategist at oscar gruss amp son in new york the moves siphoned needed investment capital out of the markets and into the hands of bureaucrats delaying the turnaround

8405420 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8405421 compre lo que quiera incluyendo la conciencia de las personas
8405422 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8405423 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia
8405424 no muy presente en los libros pero si muy viva en la memoria oral de nuestro pueblo
8405425 d nde est curalaba d nde se firm el parlamento de quillen en qu lugar naci kilapan son preguntas que intento responder rescatando lugares geogr ficos y efem rides que debieran llenarnos de orgullo como naci n
8405426 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
8405427 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8405428 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8405429 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8405430 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8405431 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8405432 je moet verrekte goed oppassen met dit garen dat je geen steek laat vallen want je ziet geen steek
8405433 after barack obama won the nomination i went to chicago and met with his campaign staff and i told them i thought there were two ways to run statewide in ohio
8405434 one was the john kerry way the other was the sherrod brown ted strickland way and that i would recommend the sherrod brown ted strickland way what i meant by that was john kerry focused almost exclusively on ohios major metropolitan areas where he did very well but the losses that he experienced in the smaller towns and rural areas were so severe that it more than offset the urban areas and when i ran for governor and sherrod ran for the senate we made a very conscious effort to focus on every area of ohio and that we were going to try and compete in every county knowing that we were not likely to win every county but also understanding that if you dont compete you have no way of reaching the voters who would vote for you if they were asked quite frankly
8405435 i think that was a very good sign that this was not going to be a top down kind of campaign
8405436 it was going to be a bottom up structure and i think thats working very well in my judgment whats going to provide the winning margin for barack obama is not the media but its going to be the ground operation
8405437 i think we are arguably the best political party in the nation
8405438 i think she gave an incredibly elegant and gracious speech last night
8405439 i think that she laid out that this election is more important than two individuals that it is a about the future of the country and i felt that the proper thing for me to do was set an example for the ohio delegation and cast my vote for sen obama
8405440 recognition of the fact that hillary worked so hard and struggled so hard and did so well in the ohio primary but i dont think that ought to be viewed as any divisive or hostile action at all
8405441 one thing i think john mccain should be held accountable for is his lack of support for veterans
8405442 is race a factor in this election or will it be i assume it will be
8405443 just like race is a factor in every aspect of american life today we would be unrealistic to claim otherwise but i believe that the candidate that talks directly and convincingly about the economy i believe thats the candidate that will be elected president and i believe thats the candidate who will win ohio this nations economy is in serious trouble
8405444 take charge be direct precise forceful and saying to the people what they will do as president to help get this economy turned around i have heard nothing from john mccain that gives me the slightest hope that he will take any action that will deviate significantly from what george bush is already doing
8405445 so i think that as this campaign develops people will come to see that if they elect john mccain they will get four more years of george bush policy
8405446 i dont think thats an unfair thing for me to say and i think people desperately need change and they will vote for obama and biden because obama and biden are taking on the serious issues in this country
8405447 i am not running for senate i am not running for senate
8405448 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
8405449 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8405450 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8405451 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano
8405452 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8405453 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
8405454 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
8405455 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8405456 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8405457 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8405458 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche

8405462 scuttling gangs were neighbourhood based youth gangs which were formed in working class districts across the manchester conurbation from the independent county borough of salford to the west of the city to the townships of bradford gorton and openshaw to the east
8405463 most of the victims of such assaults appear to have been young males
8405464 non hispanic white women and other racial and ethnic groups were having more babies too
8405465 you need to personalize and humanize it to the community so that you dont ask the question generically you ask the question how do we add more people to new york to miami to l a when theyre already packed to the brink wheres the housing come from wheres the transportation come from be specific dont talk about infrastructure infrastructure nobody gets no one understands
8405466 we are restructuring on air talent and there will be some changes beginning next week

8405483 het is mijn doel om er een fantastisch swingende tent van te maken
8405484 dit is een hoogtepunt in mijn loopbaan als bestuurder ik vind het een heel grote eer dat ik als voorzitter van deze heel belangrijke bond mag gaan optreden
8405485 amateurvoetbal is het allerbelangrijkste zonder amateurvoetbal is er ook geen profvoetbal
8405486 profs en amateurs binnen de knvb moeten verder naar elkaar toegroeien daar ga ik me voor inzetten
8405487 dat wordt in maart tijdens een congres in kopenhagen gekozen het is belangrijk dat ik in de toekomst namens de knvb in dat bestuur mee mag praten we willen graag het wk in 2018 naar nederland en belgi praten dat is makkelijker als je dicht bij het vuur zit de uefa wil voor die eindronde namelijk maar een europees land bij de fifa kandideren
8405488 hoe groter een project hoe meer kans dat het zal mislukken
8405489 ik heb ruim zesduizend projecten in het bedrijfsleven bekeken en zo twee zaken helder gekregen ten eerste kun je uit de kosten van een project vrij precies afleiden hoe omvangrijk een project is en ten tweede blijkt bij een bepaalde omvang een bepaalde faalkans te horen hoe groter de omvang hoe groter die faalkans
8405490 er diende een integraal uitkeringssysteem te komen alle uitkeringen moesten er in de toekomst mee verwerkt kunnen worden maar dat is een onmogelijke eis niemand weet welke uitkeringen er over een jaar weer worden bedacht daar kun je dus geen systeem op bouwen
8405491 in het bedrijfsleven kost een project gemiddeld een paar ton natuurlijk wordt daar ook voor vele miljoenen geautomatiseerd maar die programmas zijn opgedeeld in veel kleine projecten faalt een project dan is er een paar ton weg en geen 87 miljoen zoals nu bij het uwv
8405492 en de politiek stapelt terwijl het project al onderweg is veel te makkelijk eisen en wensen op elkaar
8405493 ik heb drie scenarios onderzocht een optimistisch een gemiddeld en een pessimistisch scenario bij dit uwv project kwam ik op een faalkans van 40 procent dat is veel maar er zijn projecten met een n g groter risico
8405494 eerlijk gezegd stemt die 87 miljoen exact overeen met wat ik in het pessimistische scenario had berekend
8405495 er zijn te weinig evaluatiemomenten ingebouwd bij dit soort projecten wordt vaak gedacht we gaan iets automatiseren in plaats van we gaan het proces verbeteren
8405496 is there not one fucking normal person in his whole fucking staff that says
8405497 our relationship with bell is not acrimonious we have a good relationship
8405498 the general reasons for why we would disconnect a wholesale customer the main one would be significant non payment
8405499 ik sta hier als een trotse moeder een trotse democraat een trotse senator van new york een trotse amerikaanse en een trotse aanhanger van barack obama
8405500 maakte je alleen deel uit van mijn campagne vanwege mij of was het voor die marinier die moeder voor alle mensen in dit land die zich onzichtbaar voelen
8405501 er is een journalistiek inhoudelijke reden voor deze obama serie het is voor het eerst in de amerikaanse geschiedenis dat een van de twee partijen een zwarte presidentskandidaat aanwijst
8405502 de wereld draait door begint een week later en er was een gat dat we moesten vullen
8405503 ik zal op de conventie voor obama stemmen maar alleen als hillary clinton haar afgevaardigden vrijgeeft
8405504 sinds 1850 heeft ons district nog nooit een democraat verkozen maar dit jaar kan het haar tegenkandidaat is maar in de helft van het district echt bekend en carol voert campagne op groene themas zelf hangt ze haar was buiten te drogen zomer n winter daarom is haar symbool een wasknijper ik zal die elke dag aan mijn toegangspas klemmen
8405505 in november zal ik natuurlijk voor obama en biden stemmen wie dat niet doet is geen echte democraat biden is een goede keus als vicepresident maar hillary was beter geweest ze brengt 18 miljoen gegarandeerde stemmen mee
8405506 ik ben op weg naar denver om te kijken hoe het er aan toegaat donderdag ga ik naar de toespraak van obama
8405507 mijn bedrijf is overgenomen door hewlett packard dus nu zit ik in over mijn baan
8405508 ik was een aanhanger van kucinich tot die het opgaf en nu ben ik voor obama dat vind ik ook een heel goede vent maar wel meer een politicus hij weegt zijn woorden en zijn meningen anders kan hij ook niet gekozen worden donderdag in het stadion verwacht ik een inspirerende toespraak en ze zullen wel willen dat we voor ons kaartje iets terug doen langs de deuren gaan of mensen bellen
8405509 zoiets heb ik nog nooit gedaan ik ben nogal verlegen maar dit keer overweeg ik het het zijn belangrijke verkiezingen de wereld heeft
8405510 het is hier soms regen regen en nog eens regen

8405512 i have days when i wake up and i just dont want to do anything
8405513 i wanted to do something that i can remember and take with me things i can keep forever meeting lil wayne i wouldnt have anything permanent to remember
8405514 its exciting and its sad at the same time because i would rather have him win this in a drawing other than because he has this disease
8405515 our goal is to create joy after hard times with illnesses
8405516 many kids who are selected for our program go on to live long and happy lives
8405517 its uncommon to have two kids from the stillwater area at around the same time
8405518 i always tell cody that he cant use his disease as an excuse for not doing the things he wants to do he is just as capable as anyone else
8405519 its swinging like somebody caught in a tree and thats when you can really see the cabling and its the exact shape of a body same size everything but its just covered in moss
8405520 its exactly what it looks like just somebody caught in a harness in a seat harness
8405521 all of them were generally lost in the fog and bang they go in
8405522 there were a lot of aircraft lost up there during the war and a lot of japanese aircraft as well
8405523 isnt it interesting that we are the only animals in this world that respect the remains of a dead person
8405524 we are the only animals in this world that respect the remains of a deceased member of our species
8405525 wouldnt time birds weather etc have broken everything down a long time ago
8405526 if i need it for the generators i got it if i dont i can put it in the truck when the gas prices go up
8405527 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8405528 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8405529 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8405530 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8405531 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8405532 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8405533 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8405534 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8405535 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8405536 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8405537 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8405538 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8405539 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8405540 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8405541 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies

8405547 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8405548 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept
8405549 it took decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the drug
8405550 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8405551 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8405552 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8405553 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8405554 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8405555 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8405556 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8405557 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8405558 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8405559 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8405560 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8405561 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita
8405562 anticipate at least an 80 percent shut in of the energy production region for environmental and safety purposes
8405563 were getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8405564 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8405565 the two hijackers were transported to one of the halls at kufrah airport after giving themselves up
8405566 we believe the capital markets ultimately will insist on ifrs for public companies
8405567 todays action by the sec continues a robust and thoughtful debate that is critical as the transition occurs
8405568 there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
8405569 han gjorde s nt man inte ska p en inspelning
8405570 weer zo eentje met een te kort geheugen rara hoe kan dat toch
8405571 als zulke zaken naar buiten komen dan hebben de hoofdrolspelers altijd last van alzheimer
8405572 het onderwijs in nederland is kennelijk zo afgetakeld dat politici zelfs hun eigen naam niet meer correct kunnen schrijven
8405573 toch heel kwalijk hoor als men niet meer weet wat men in het verleden heeft ondertekend zeker gekeken naar wijnand duyvendak ook hier geldt aftreden middels dwang of misschien eleganter zelf aftreden zonder wachtgeld
8405574 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war we dont want one
8405575 i would say what has happened is a threat to everyone not just for one country
8405576 any nation could be next any country when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the independence or existence of any country any nation
8405577 when we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity we put into doubt the independence or existence of any country any nation
8405578 to protect them against rogue states and terrorists armed with icbms
8405579 can you please not attack our allies or we will be very upset
8405580 what concerns me today is that our council will most likely vote on this matter at the next council meeting and i think the votes are currently there for passing whatever dollar amount our elected leaders see fit as far as i see this matter itll have at least 3 solid votes for spending in franklin olson sohns and solomon
8405581 until i see an economic impact study with the benefits for the city of franklin i will not vote on this proposal
8405582 someone needs to figure out the benefit increase for each community
8405583 coming to the city of franklin for money at this point i dont think is appropriate oak creek officials havent approached any other players including south milwaukee and milwaukee county to involve them nor have they gone to the dot and fought the case that this is a regional issue
8405584 i love pogo ive been playing on pogo com for about a good 4 years now i just now got my friends to join pogo as well and they love it i am 24 years old i have 3 daughters now

8405635 the battle decided that the king of england henceforth would be basically french and oriented toward the southern latin orbit of medieval europe
8405636 this is no small thing england became a rich populous and advanced kingdom and the explosion of the 12th century renaissance in europe has no small english influence
8405637 but it was also a symbolic moment almost like the crowning of the british empire they come out of this decade of trying to be a superpower and at that moment it happens so waterloo has taken on status of great battle but it really was something that transcended the military significance to a point where its far more than just a battle
8405638 the muslim advance might have continued far into northern europe around into italy and possibly even england certainly at the time there was some question about whether or not latin christendom would survive victory at poitiers was an important step in the development of french power and laid the foundation for the dynasty that charlemagne would later create
8405639 it was the beginning of the third year of the war
8405640 in this theater of war the east coast the confederates had never lost and the yankees had never won they had total contempt for the yankee soldiers and thought themselves invincible
8405641 the tide ebbed after this and the south never recovered the momentum it had had before
8405642 you got another package just like the one you got yesterday

8405644 you mean i can keep this imac even though you know about it now and apple wont charge me for it
8405645 no sir its our mistake wed like it back but its up to you
8405646 just think of all the good you could do if you kept the imac you could donate it to someone

8405653 we were notified that our gas budget is going up by 15 000 per year we currently have 56 units and 11 buildings and we are going to build another building if you consider having 12 charges instead of 56 maybe we could work something out
8405654 ive seen war up close not as a political slogan or some think tank theory i support barack obama because america needs a president who has the strength and wisodom and courage to talk to our enemie and consult with our allies
8405655 even with the michael jackson task whenever hed do something you guys would go thats amazing
8405656 thats not helping dude people with disabilities they wanna be able to do it to the best of their ability they dont wanna be told that things are amazing were all on tv and we dont wanna look like s

8405675 door zijn exotische uiterlijk en zuignapjes aan vingers en tenen is de boomkikker een logische keuze voor herintroductie
8405676 de boomkikker kan dienen als vaandeldrager als breekijzer om een natuurgebied op te knappen maar soms geeft lnv de vergunningen wel erg makkelijk ravon wil liever niet het signaal afgeven dat de natuur maakbaar is we trekken een vat kikkers open en het komt goed als een leefgebied niet in orde is wordt herintroductie een fiasco de noodzaak moet ook eerst aangetoond worden

8405692 op deze manier houden we het nog maar een paar weken uit
8405693 ik wil van de knvb weer een fijne swingende tent maken
8405694 er moet onderling wantrouwen worden weggenomen evenals platini die met twee stemmen verschil voorzitter van de uefa werd zal ik me erop toeleggen het vertrouwen van de tegenstemmers te winnen
8405695 het is jammer dat het amateur en betaald voetbal zo ver van elkaar zijn gedreven
8405696 we zijn aan het polariseren geslagen daar moet een einde aan komen
8405697 een breed internationaal netwerk bekendheid en ervaring zijn tegenwoordig onmisbaar om kans te maken in het uefa bestuur te worden gekozen mijn lange staat van dienst in het voetbal spreekt in dit verband voor zich
8405698 volksgezondheid welzijn en sport in n portefeuille is mijns inziens te fors
8405699 ik sliep al twee dagen met mijn kleren aan ik voelde dat het niet goed zat
8405700 ik moet er niet aan denken dat de winter begint
8405701 daar werkten ook georgi rs er waren geen vijandelijkheden en nu blijken het opeens fascisten ik snap het niet
8405702 het is een vreselijk gevoel dat je zelfs in een schuilkelder niet veilig bent
8405703 wij zijn het meeste land al kwijt we hebben geen pretenties meer een wereldmacht te zijn die tijd ligt achter ons het enige wat wij willen is dit kleine stukje land in de bergen
8405704 ik zou het niet doen ze spreken geen russisch en zijn gevaarlijk
8405705 voor je het weet rent dit biggetje zuid osseti in en dan zijn we hem kwijt
8405706 president saakasjvili is een wijs man en hij heeft veel goeds gedaan voor ons land en natuurlijk is zuid osseti georgisch en zal het altijd georgisch blijven maar hij had nooit zuid osseti binnen moeten vallen eerlijk gezegd houdt die politiek mij niet zo bezig ik denk nu alleen aan hoe ik de volgende dag overleef
8405707 daarom is dit graf zo rommelig wij zaten midden in de vuurlinie
8405708 rusland voorziet al in de humanitaire hulp onze taak is het beschermen van de georgische minderheid
8405709 de haat zit nog diep bij de osseten drie dagen geleden kregen wij toestemming om de lichamen van 45 georgische soldaten op te graven in een ossetisch dorp uiteindelijk ging het niet door toen kwade dorpelingen ons met geweren het dorp uit jaagden
8405710 dat zijn we nu precies in kaart aan het brengen
8405711 theaterpubliek blijft netjes zitten en zal beleefd applaudisseren maar lang niet alle hiphoppers kennen de theatercodes ze zijn gewend om mee te brullen
8405712 ik zie mezelf meer in hem dan in de ouders die me hebben opgevoed zonder hen tekort te willen doen
8405713 die strijd is een metafoor voor de strijd in jezelf die eeuwig doorgaat verleidingen tegen jezelf liegen als de wekker gaat praat ik al tegen mezelf dat ik te ziek of te moe ben om op te staan en zo gaat dat de hele dag hier zit n en al conflict op de bank en daar zit de meest relaxte gast die er is
8405714 hiphop is vaak heel stellig ik ben dit weg met jou en natuurlijk is dat maar de helft van het verhaal het is heel prettig meerdere kanten te laten zien en antwoorden schuldig te mogen blijven
8405715 in dat nummer zeg ik ik wil het nu ten koste van alles dat is iets dat we op tv zien maar ook om ons heen leeftijdsgenoten wachten niet op een platenlabel of een kans die gaan zelf hun ding doen zelf kleding ontwerpen of een website verzinnen die willen geen advocaat worden om rijk te worden ze volgen liever het voorbeeld van de nerd die hyves bedacht en rijk werd snap je
8405716 het heeft veel te maken met het amerikaanse live the dream je moet het zelf waarmaken soms ten koste van
8405717 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8405718 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8405719 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8405720 david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all there was no police no crash no paparazzi chase etc just very incorrect reports via internet gossip sites
8405721 the studio knew the trucks were rickety there had even been an internal memo about the railings
8405722 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
8405723 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better
8405724 thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hired 200 more inspectors with more to come in this fiscal year
8405725 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running to oversee the production process
8405726 while others characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important part of an effective inspection system the review of results from testing records and cooking temperature employed in a plant are fundamental that the processes employed by the plant are in control
8405727 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8405728 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8405729 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it
8405730 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hiring 200 more inspectors
8405731 marc edouard is one of the top young defenceman in the game and we are excited to have him in to fold for the next several years
8405732 he has a tremendous future with this franchise and we look forward to watching his continued development
8405733 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8405734 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8405735 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8405736 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8405737 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8405738 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8405739 the journey will be difficult the road will be long
8405740 i jumped up and iooked out here and i could see the whole back of the house engulfed in flames im talking about you couldnt have got back in there period
8405741 thats hard to believe really hard to believe im sure they know what theyre doing and know more about it than i do but he never came on as a guy that would be a suicide
8405742 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8405743 weve had a real focus on trying to drive our subscriber acquisition cost numbers down a lot of that is being able to develop better opportunities for third parties to market us
8405744 i pretty much designed and built the teahouse with a few of my friends
8405745 we were coming from the perspective of having visited teahouses in china and all over the world teahouses should be nourishing relaxing mellow
8405746 we have always wanted to serve tea but have never had the appropriate space
8405747 when we moved the clinic here a few years ago we began a design process of opening up this integrated space where people can access food tea acupuncture
8405748 i started drinking it and studying it its integral to medicine in china its supposed to be a process it takes some time to drink tea i knew that we needed to create an inner space within the teahouse that put the outside outside
8405749 people always say wow i cant believe im 8 feet off of guadalupe street
8405750 mouse might make it cheaper to identify cancer causing chemicals
8405751 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8405752 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8405753 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add
8405754 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8405755 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8405756 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8405757 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8405758 a decision hasnt yet been made on whether to make beer products available permanently
8405759 a decision will be made based in part by the reaction we get from customers
8405760 this is the book i wish i had four years ago thats when i faced the equally unpleasant tasks of fixing old broken gui tests and coaxing a rickety third party toolkit into running new tests i started looking for a how to guide on gui testing to help me down this road unfortunately there were none plenty of people had written beautifully about testing in general but not about user interfaces specifically what few gui books did exist were long dry restricted to technologies i couldnt use or built on test frameworks that looked like someones homework assignment
8405761 if defcon is any indication this book will be a huge hit with the hacker community
8405762 we rushed copies to defcon and sold everything we had in two hours with half of those books claimed before we even unpacked the boxes by the following monday morning we were getting emails from readers telling us how helpful they were finding the book i havent seen anything like this demand in years
8405763 i attempted to get up to use the restroom rather urgently during the 7th inning stretch as god bless america was beginning
8405764 as soon as the latter came out of my mouth my right arm was twisted violently behind my back and i was informed that i was being escorted out of the stadium
8405765 i was sitting in the tier level and of course this is the highest level of the stadium and i was escorted in this painful manner down the entire length of the stadium
8405766 when we reached the exit of the stadium they confiscated my ticket and the first officer shoved me through the turnstiles saying get the hell out of my country if you dont like it
8405767 nowhere on the yankee stadium ticket policy nor on any posted sign does it say that forced patriotism is a required element to attend a baseball game nowhere in the laws of this country would that begin to be defensible
8405768 furthermore when the two officers returned to their section steve who was still in the stadium overhead one of the officers say we got to watch ourselves
8405769 i do not believe in god nor am in support of this country to a degree of patriotic fanaticism the fact that i wanted to use the restroom instead of standing through god bless america should not be grounds for a forcible ejection from a baseball game
8405770 this tip doesnt surprise me at all everyone has to stand just like in school and youll get berated and harassed if you dont
8405771 mr steinbrenner wanted to do all games to remind the fans about how important it is to honor our nation our service members those that died on sept 11 and those fighting for our nation
8405772 our battalion was added to the russian peacekeeping contingent in southern ossetia last fall before the beginning of these events meaning the georgian offensive into tskhinvali there were two companies of our battalion here
8405773 even though we were ready for possible provocation a mass attack on tskhinvali was nevertheless unanticipated
8405774 there in tskhinvali it was real hell over the course of all of these days we werent able to communicate with our families who naturally were very worried because there was no way to reach us and we were unable to recharge our cell phones my older brother broke through to us on the third day because there was information that we had all been killed we were practically all on the brink of extermination if not for the kadyrovsky regiment 1 who came to our aid
8405775 they stopped the georgian attack and saved us from certain death
8405776 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present

8405780 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present
8405781 i wish the help had reached us on time that way at least my children could have been safe
8405782 my child is so ill i cannot do a thing about it i wonder what i did wrong that my child must suffer
8405783 his holiness the dalai lama has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8405784 the dalai lama is fine hes just exhausted he has had a hectic schedule for the last year with events scheduled almost every day
8405785 has a little bit of discomfort in his stomach he is going for a check up now
8405786 they told me they know they want to get rid of samak thaksin and all their cronies but the problem is they dont seem to know what will happen if they do
8405787 the leader of the pad sondhi limthongkul has told me that the entire political system needs to be changed and says that perhaps thailand isnt ready for full democracy because of the endemic corruption
8405788 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8405789 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8405790 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8405791 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8405792 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8405793 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8405794 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8405795 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8405796 since we have questioned the ioas action to dissolve our body in the delhi high court we retain the right to call the meeting
8405797 how can he call an agm for the simple reason that the ihf doesnt exist at present i dont think there will be any response to his call
8405798 though the mha committee will sit and decide i personally think that every state association should go for the meeting the reason i say this is because the ad hoc committee has alienated the state associations
8405799 the bengal hockey association has called a seminar where we will chalk out our strategy
8405800 this was fun professor i think we should do it again
8405801 este es un equipo joven y queremos que evolucione satisfactoriamente por lo que espero seriedad y compromiso por parte de todos los componentes
8405802 como se puede ver estamos en un club creado por gente con mucha ilusi n a la que ha costado mucho esfuerzo a nivel econ mico as como personal el llevar a cabo este proyecto por lo que hay que compensar en la pista de esta forma hemos pensado que hay un conjunto suficientemente fuerte como para quedar entre los cuatro primeros de la liga y si es posible ascender a nacional a

8405814 oversee and implement the companys recently announced capital management and credit loss reduction plan
8405815 in carrying out fannie maes capital management plan to ensure the company remains in a solid capital position
8405816 this team will be responsible for meeting the dual objectives of conserving capital and controlling credit losses while fannie mae continues to provide crucial liquidity to the u s housing and mortgage markets
8405817 as we move through the bottom of this cycle maintaining capital managing credit and driving revenues are the priorities and we have to organize and staff accordingly
8405818 target date funds remain a favored fund category for a number of reasons
8405819 in the present environment the primary reason would be their imperviousness to market conditions leading to the conclusion that they are both a safe investment for both product development dollars in terms of net sales and investor goals as measured by overall performance
8405820 the big increase in share of net flows this year is directly related to the decrease in industry total
8405821 we didnt win but it was more important to advance
8405822 we created several good chances but also our defense performed well its nice to qualify but thats just a beginning the best is still to come
8405823 we have to acknowledge that our opponent was better and deserved to advance
8405824 my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8405825 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8405826 hell be the only man up here today so hes got to be pretty special
8405827 we appreciate hall of fame racing helping us get joey ready for 2009
8405828 they came to us with the idea before the august michigan race and we think its a great win win for all of us
8405829 austria fully understands the importance of the indo us nuclear deal and indias right to produce energy from whatever sources it desires we want india to meet its objectives as for the nsg meet we want the group to achieve a result that would be a net gain and we are confident that it will happen
8405830 its difficult to spell out specifics as the process is still on but we are confident that what happens will add to international security
8405831 umm you do know that youre quadruplets and that youre already sort of supertwins right
8405832 eu queria tornar o filme e os factos da ocupa o do iraque dispon vel a um grande n mero de pessoas a minha esperan a que isto contribua para um melhoramento das pol ticas externas no iraque ou em qualquer outro lado
8405833 transparency trust and control with respect to the sites they visit
8405834 if ie8 helps heighten awareness of this value exchange thats a step in the right direction
8405835 today as a user we have no visibility or control over how that information is shared and recorded
8405836 i wouldnt put microsoft as being the arbiter of what should and shouldnt be tracked
8405837 i think microsoft realizes we all realize that its a beta version and its sure to change before its finalized
8405838 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8405839 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8405840 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8405841 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8405842 unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8405843 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8405844 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8405845 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8405846 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8405847 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8405848 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8405849 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8405850 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8405851 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8405852 working with a number of clients institutions like yours and we would like to help you identify earmarks federal support and grants
8405853 to meet the demand in the southwest chicago metropolitan area
8405854 two years ago we graduated more african american and hispanic nurses than any private college in the state of illinois
8405855 im not at all apologetic that we asked for federal support for huge health care needs of this growing community
8405856 he was a crucial supporter of the law in that he paved the way for other democrats to support it
8405857 senator biden provided a lot of political cover for the credit card industry because they wanted to show that the proposal had bipartisan support he aggressively undermined the opposition to the bill
8405858 hunter consulted for five years as an expert on these very same issues at a time of enormous expansion in online banking
8405859 he was never a lobbyist for mbna and his work had absolutely nothing to do with the bankruptcy bill zero nothing
8405860 he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8405861 while barack obama decries washington insiders and says that he detests lobbyists joe biden is the model washington insider with numerous connections to lobbyists and special interests
8405862 as strong a supporter of ethics reform as the senate has ever known and his office follows all ethics laws right down to the letter
8405863 fine dining restaurant owner looking for a personal assistant applicant needs to have great personal presentation practice socially acceptable hygiene standards a personal vehicle positive mental attitude be able to handle pressure situations have multitasking abilities and an open mind an interest in restaurants and small business operations is required if interested submit a resume if available and a photo of yourself compensation plenty for the right candidate
8405864 the show nomination is always huge because the office is truly an ensemble show and that always means a lot but i am going to be honest with you i really do want an emmy for playing pam i love pam and whatever happens in my career from here on out it will have happened because of her i just love playing her so it would be great to be able to honor the role in that way and while were at it i would love for john to get a nomination too he really deserves it
8405865 these three events add up to a planet in deep trouble
8405866 but while states and companies are responding to the climate crisis the washington politicians are just spraying offshore oil on the fire
8405867 climate trifecta sea ice levels polar bears and hurricane fay
8405868 you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows
8405869 sure we can affect the soil the air and the land detrementally with our industrious society but the climate hogwash

8405874 ever since i was a youth ive always been searching for the truth
8405875 the fortune 500 have overwhelmingly decided that including sexual orientation is in the best corporate interest and helps communicate corporate values to the estimated 660 billion annual domestic glbt consumer market
8405876 he seems to be lining up to justify quitting on the job
8405877 thats the approach taken by a loser and hes going to have to explain that to canadians why he wouldnt respect parliament on so many occasions
8405878 i want to hear about this so called agenda that he keeps talking about but its hard for me to believe mr
8405879 im always open to that kind of complete transformation but im not holding my breath
8405880 has every right under our system to fire a prime minister
8405881 obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8405882 i havent spent the last 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house
8405883 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8405884 we need barack obama and joe biden in the white house
8405885 proud supporter of barack obama ms clinton dismissed republican john mccain with a few choice words
8405886 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8405887 i know a little bit about how the white house works and with michelle obama we are going to have someone who can answer that phone
8405888 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8405889 we are looking to see where we are and where we need to get better
8405890 we have a young team with three freshmen and a number of players who havent played quality minutes or are coming back from injury they need to get a look and gain a feel for what were trying to do perhaps most importantly we need to change our personality as a team as we look toward october and preseason practice
8405891 i think both the practices in preparation for the trip and the games we will play are important but i think the practices are supremely important
8405892 there are roles that we want to try and define whos going to play this position or that position i dont think well answer all of those questions but well start to take a real hard look at what thats going to look like
8405893 the practice sessions have been good i dont have a problem at all with how hard theyve worked with what weve asked them to do i think its been a little slow transitioning ourselves mentally to injecting ones personality or personalities on this team so we start to look drastically different than we did last year because we are different
8405894 theyll have a great opportunity and well throw them in there
8405895 because they werent here last year and they missed several days of practice theyre behind a little which is to be expected well try to do a good job of getting them caught up but they wont be completely caught up from a cardio standpoint or a knowledge standpoint well just throw them in the water and see if they can swim
8405896 india nabs boy 14 in ipod slay police look to screen every vehicle in new york for terrorism in 1976 steve jobs steve wozniak and ron wayne design and began selling the apple 1 computer at a price of 666
8405897 were not big in the line and this gives us a chance by leveling the playing field
8405898 big girl panties during the day and pull ups at night to prevent wetting the bed
8405899 the boned age includes plenty of wipeouts skits and the freshest tricks in all aspects of the sport from magoon creating new rail combinations to ejt experimental jump technologies
8405900 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8405901 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8405902 any attempts to jeopardize this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8405903 what concerns me today is that our council will most likely vote on this matter at the next council meeting and i think the votes are currently there for passing whatever dollar amount our elected leaders see fit as far as i see this matter itll have at least 3 solid votes for spending in franklin olson sohns and solomon
8405904 until i see an economic impact study with the benefits for the city of franklin i will not vote on this proposal
8405905 someone needs to figure out the benefit increase for each community
8405906 coming to the city of franklin for money at this point i dont think is appropriate oak creek officials havent approached any other players including south milwaukee and milwaukee county to involve them nor have they gone to the dot and fought the case that this is a regional issue
8405907 i think she gave a very good speech from her point of view and our point of view but not necessarily for barack obamas point of view
8405908 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8405909 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8405910 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8405911 this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win
8405912 good but not quite very good for barack obama in 2008 even better if things should turn out like they might for hillary clinton in 2012
8405913 what was missing was much in the way of description of barack obama what kind of man is he one who supports the same positions she does
8405914 has she looked deep into his heart and found something worthy no evidence here that she had would he be a good commander in chief not a word on that as the mccain campaign quickly and gleefully noted
8405915 the first time since 1976 that a convention has been more excited about a loser than a winner
8405916 those two both need for obama to lose and theyre going to do whatever they can after they leave denver to see that that happens
8405917 it may make you feel very very old but the macintosh will be turning 25 in january as we approach this momentous anniversary oreilly news had
8405918 it may make you feel very very old but the macintosh will be turning 25
8405919 id totally spent a saturday afternoon watching that on hbo
8405920 but if we look at the seven to eight year olds a different picture emerges
8405921 i think that both genes and culture play a role
8405922 social norms of equality can come into being even without extended forms of cultural transmission
8405923 nobody would dispute that the sexual maturation of children is driven by biology and genes so why should other phenotypes like those associated with fairness behavior not also be driven by biology and genes
8405924 i think my feet hurt because for once my shoes arent wet
8405925 life as we experience it is rarely just one straight and direct line from point a to point b
8405926 interesting thats what you call my endless tsuris struggles and aggravation interesting
8405927 leads to anaemia at the extremities and apoplexy at the centre
8405928 winning the gold medal was amazing and coming back here to los angeles was great
8405929 we jumped back in coach michael cooper has been working them really hard and has made a lot of improvements we have seven games left and we are tied for third in the west with definitely our work cut out for us
8405930 our defense is what pushes this team whats always going to determine how successful we are
8405931 when we decided to start locking down on defense thats what happened we didnt do that in the third quarter

8405933 a political party is entitled to have the names of its nominees for president and vice president placed on the ballot if before 5 p m of the 70th day before presidential election day the partys state chair signs and delivers to the secretary of state a written certification of the names of the partys nominees for president and vice president
8405934 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8405935 what other critical time tables will be missed if either one of them gets the presidency
8405936 a nominee for a statewide office who received a number of votes equal to at least five percent of the total number of votes received by all candidates for that office
8405937 both parties filed before the deadline we expect their amended filings after both parties finish their nominating process at the conventions
8405938 my internal clock is telling me all right lets go and ive still got a month to wait
8405939 i think theres a lot less to worry about in the nhl as coach and general manager in kitchener i oversaw every detail of training camp from travel to booking ice time to cutting players to scheduling
8405940 at this level youve got people that do all those things you just coach
8405941 i always wanted to coach in the nhl i knew that
8405942 at the same time i wasnt in a rush to get there i really appreciated the level i was at
8405943 i really want to go in with a clean slate with this team
8405944 no pre conceived opinions on the players i really want to give them the opportunity in camp to come out and prove themselves regardless of whats happened in the past here or how theyve played and performed
8405945 when you dont make the playoffs for seven or eight years there is some baggage that gets dragged through year to year with you
8405946 were going to try and eliminate that and start fresh
8405947 margo is a veteran who brings experience and solid defensive presence to our frontcourt
8405948 shes a good seasoned vet that can block shots rebound and finish
8405949 whats a blackshirt mean if its just a symbol you havent earned
8405950 that black shirt represents dependability trust a sense that teammates can depend on me to do everything in my power to play the best defense known to mankind
8405951 me personally i think we need a game or two or three or four or five to prove not only to ourselves but to our coaches and fans that we deserve them
8405952 it was the same way when i was here the first time i dont see the point of it if you just hand them out to hand them out im looking for them to be earned
8405953 i do believe these kids will step up they will
8405954 they didnt go to the university of nebraska to be regular guys they came to be something special to win championships thats where the bar was set we have to give them a little time theyre going to get it right
8405955 mason and kordell are going to be a one two punch right now we havent locked in which exactly are going to be masons plays and who are going to be kordells plays
8405956 jourdan is a big man joe brings something different as well
8405957 the coaches have done a good job of divvying up the pie
8405958 were going to continue to be a pro style offense so were going to have to run the ball for our offense to be effective
8405959 from the start youre going to need both facets but we do have a lot of experience coming back in the passing game were just going to continue to push along and try to bring both of them along at the same time
8405960 ive got more brain trust over there than a man deserves
8405961 im the same guy i just switched offices if i change then shame on me
8405962 for us to be successful weve got to take the heat off no 5 white and no 7 devine
8405963 hes a backup running back starting slot receiver kick returner and hes got a great head on his shoulders
8405964 he just brings so much to the table were going to do more than just throw bubble screens to him
8405965 we want to get that running game going get our guys some confidence
8405966 sometimes when youre a lineman and youre constantly backing up and blocking a guy when its time to run maybe you dont fire out quite so hard
8405967 its just another reason to get that running game going
8405968 having extra motivation being picked last by everybody thats fine with us
8405969 were perfectly happy being underdogs game in and game out we feel like maybe some teams will overlook us or look to the next game and we can sneak up and stun some people
8405970 we know were a huge underdog and the chances are even worse than david and goliath
8405971 we dont have enough stones up here but were looking forward to it
8405972 anybody that plays sports should go in expecting to win
8405973 all you guys like to refer to the michigan game and ill refer to it too
8405974 we had very few penalties seven against michigan our kicking game two field goals was pretty solid against michigan those two things alone kept us in the game it gave us a chance and the way it turned out a mistake in the kicking game probably cost michigan an opportunity to win the game
8405975 in our passing game its going to be quick throws getting the ball out as quick as we can
8405976 well try to run away from them and make them chase us hopefully theyll get tired by the second half
8405977 obviously theyre a quality program but playing a team like michigan with tradition like that it was definitely surprising
8405978 i guess were just preparing we respect all of our opponents and well be ready to go like any other week
8405979 were looking forward to it i think both schools are looking forward to it
8405980 theyre the defending national champions so are we even though theres a huge gap in there and lsu knows that just as well as we do its a great challenge for us
8405981 sai jacob se non fosse che siamo nemici giurati e che ti piacerebbe rubarmi la mia unica ragione di vita penso che mi andresti a genio
8405982 forse se non fossi un vampiro disgustoso che ha in programma di succhiare la vita alla ragazza che amo be no nemmeno in quel caso
8405983 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8405984 i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment we have in canada would be unlikely
8405985 it certainly will give whoever wins that election hopefully ourselves that mandate to proceed and to proceed quite aggressively for some period of time
8405986 its important if possible to verify my analysis with the other opposition leaders if theres an election i think its important to give all the parties a chance to prepare
8405987 if he didnt run that way he wouldnt be the kind of back he is
8405988 hes been able to run that way and not be banged up and i think he will continue that
8405989 we need to play them enough that we have a feeling for if they can play and if they can contribute or not
8405990 it will be interesting to see what he can do for four quarters
8405991 i think he showed the world that hes capable of being an every down back
8405992 anything extra you get out of barber it may shock the world
8405993 you know what youre getting out of him every play
8405994 the spark he gives i didnt think hed be able to give us that as a starter just because you play that role you come in that second series its something special but he does it as a starter i think hes going to be a big part of what were doing
8405995 margo is a veteran who brings experience and solid defensive presence to our frontcourt
8405996 shes a good seasoned vet that can block shots rebound and finish
8405997 strano sapevo di essere molto silenzioso ma non fino a questo punto

8406017 fuelwatch has a lot going for it and it didnt justify some of the criticisms that were appearing about it
8406018 so we just wanted to set the record straight about what evidence wed received
8406019 it was just an attempt to get the facts straight it was just an attempt to inform people
8406020 i invite people to read the report and they will see that its not based on the evidence we heard and i think theyll also understand that the attempt to breath new life into fuelwatch has not revived the corpse that fuelwatch is

8406022 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden us consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle
8406023 the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilisation of the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8406024 exports are holding up a lot better than we thought they would with the weakness in europe and japan and we are seeing the impact of the stimulus package on business investment decisions
8406025 that is his blessing god has a big dream for your life
8406026 i would think that our message would have increased relevancy in a time of economic uncertainty i think people want to know that god is taking care of you as it gets darker i think the brighter message shines
8406027 its gods will for you to live in prosperity instead of poverty its gods will for you to pay your bills and not be in debt its gods will for you to live in health and not in sickness all the days of your life

8406034 the accessibility of my message doesnt bother me a bit look we deal with people who are fighting cancer fighting to save their marriages dealing with the death of loved ones i dont think they need to be beaten down and i think the success of the message in the marketplace is because we are optimistic encouraging

8406052 it the capital spending numbers was strong across the board and that was the reason to buy the aussie dollar and sell bonds
8406053 i also think there will be a gradual easing cycle of rate cuts rather than an aggressive easing cycle
8406054 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8406055 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8406056 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8406057 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8406058 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8406059 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8406060 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8406061 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8406062 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8406063 when i got into a dangerous situation so i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8406064 overall we had a good balance with him in the side
8406065 he could have stayed on he was disappointed twente didnt have a go because he always wants to test himself
8406066 i took him off because he has only just come back from the hamstring injury
8406067 we want to play with the best and that means qualifying for the group stage
8406068 i felt we were well organised disciplined and focused we were never really under threat
8406069 i felt the whole team was sharp physically we were much better than saturday
8406070 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8406071 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8406072 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8406073 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8406074 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8406075 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts
8406076 we have strict orders from our higher ups to give no quarter to curfew violators and deal with any violations firmly
8406077 permatang pauh has given a clear signal to the leadership of this country we demand change we want freedom we dont want to live with corruption and oppression
8406078 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
8406079 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
8406080 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his september 16 threat
8406081 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him
8406082 anwars victory will bring good reforms to our country and will unite all the races in malaysia

8406097 britain is surrounded by water and most rivers are not being used to their potential
8406098 we are seeing demand up and down the country yet moorings in some areas are not available
8406099 there has been extensive research into the cost of importing foodstuffs by supermarkets but this is the first study of its kind into the restaurant industry and its considerable impact on the environment given that up to 30 per cent of all human induced global warming is caused by global food and agricultural systems this is one area which needs to be addressed
8406100 this is what people seem to expect but i doubt they would believe just how high the cost to the environment is in the cheaper meals
8406101 but what the research clearly points to is the need for regulation and a governing body to make restaurants more sustainable
8406102 the uks reliance on food prepared for the consumer is at an all time high
8406103 this puts restaurants in a highly prominent position the restaurant sector has the potential to be at the forefront of improving the sustainability of our food industry this of course carries the responsibility of promoting knowledge of seasonal and local produce this in turn could improve the sustainability of the food we cook at home

8406105 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8406107 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8406108 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8406109 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8406110 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8406111 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8406112 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8406113 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8406114 i dont see these changes making a dramatic difference in how the whole fannie and freddie fiasco plays out
8406115 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
8406116 most managers are taking the position that it would unthinkable to imagine a scenario where the government wouldnt back the debt
8406117 the end result is probably going to be that they go bankrupt and the government nationalizes the function
8406118 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8406119 so far so good hell get a little more work today
8406120 weve been telling you guys that hes been doing a lot of things and we have a pretty extensive workout before we let guys get back on the field
8406121 they go through a routine on the side and do some individual work and its like a decathlon so when we clear guys to come back i usually dont worry about how theyre going to be
8406122 its still to be determined from what we do and a lot of that will be based on the medical report on jim and peyton
8406123 so those guys gray and lorenzen are both going to play well see how they do and then well determine whether we keep four three or two
8406124 but hey you know what they say when you assume
8406125 the trade situation has already been presented the game doesnt really matter

8406378 the turning point of the speech and maybe the turning point of this convention was when she looked at her supporters and said were you just in this for me and then she started talking about the things they believed in and how they have a shared commitment with the obama campaign
8406379 im very comfortable that by getting people at a national level to pay attention to this race when it tightens down in the end well be able to get some support nationwide that will really help us
8406380 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8406381 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8406382 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8406383 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8406387 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8406388 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8406389 in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8406390 knee jerk calls for russia to be expelled from the g 8 or for eu russia or nato russia relations to be broken
8406391 i have to make sure they are in charge of these decisions
8406392 ooh i like this book and i think other people might too
8406393 purdues administration have a lot to answer with how they treat people unfortunately bullies win until someone stands up to them
8406394 if a minister embezzles or carries out any act of corruption would you hold the president liable the president is not responsible for a ministers mistake

8406397 were at a crossroads and jordan must protect itself and its national interests
8406398 find out what the jordanians are up to and if their contacts with hamas meant dropping support for the palestinian authority
8406399 were against any negotiations with hamas because we regard it as a terrorist movement
8406400 we should find ways to strengthen the palestinian authority instead of legitimizing hamas which made an illegal military coup in gaza
8406401 the banks are up and the resources are leading the charge
8406402 we had quite a reasonable lead from the us overnight

8406406 few will have the greatness to bend history but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events and in the total of all these acts will be written the history of this generation
8406407 each time a person stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance
8406408 the diocese has invoked the provision that returns control of the parishes to the diocese an action that was approved by the diocesan council

8406411 after reading it i dont believe i would have talked my nephew tony padilla into posting the bond and i dont think i would have come to orlando after reading that i mean im still hoping that little girls alive but theres a lot of information in those 400 papers that would lead those people to believe something different

8406420 the firm has been seeking this type of fit for over two years and had previously approached irea because of their reputation and highly qualified associates
8406421 when irea shifted its strategic focus an agreement was quickly reached and a void in our service platform was filled
8406422 the company needs to get serious about these issues or they are going to have a work stoppage on their hands
8406423 its critically important that each employee understand how the best and final offer affects them and its important that employees vote in their best interest on sept 3

8406435 the only place i really hope to go is mecca
8406436 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8406437 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8406438 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8406439 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8406440 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8406441 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8406442 the problem is that if you happen to be an individual who has the wrong genetic code in tlr3 you might inadvertently trigger a detrimental effect in your retina
8406443 you might cure the individual of one thing and increase their risk in something else
8406444 this discovery has significant implications for diagnosing the dry form of amd which is the most prevalent form affecting more than 8 million americans
8406445 it also allows us to develop new drugs to treat the dry form of amd for which there currently is no treatment
8406446 what tlr3 does in the case of infection is sacrifice an infected cell to protect the neighborhood
8406447 you and me we have a good 20 to 30 percent chance of getting macular degeneration
8406448 so when the time comes for us to start thinking about intervention we might want to get genotyped first and then decide what kind of therapeutic paradigm might be most appropriate for us
8406449 if we can figure out which viruses might be acting as triggers we might be able to find a way to combat them this would be a far more effective therapy in my view than trying to design a gene therapy approach
8406450 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8406451 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8406452 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8406453 if you think about mapping those controls and all those different type of buttons that you have to a console without a keyboard for chatting its a very challenging proposition
8406454 i mean we love console games also and im sure there will be a successful mmo sometime on a console so it has nothing to do with that its just more like a square peg round hole thing for our game it just wasnt designed with that in mind
8406455 when it comes to our nipples most of us can barely feel anything unless you bite them and that just hurts

8406474 you dont really understand human nature unless you know why a child on a merry go round will wave at his parents every time around and why his parents will always wave back
8406475 working mothers are guinea pigs in a scientific experiment to show that sleep is not necessary to human life
8406476 any mother could perform the jobs of several air traffic controllers with ease
8406477 a suburban mothers role is to deliver children obstetrically once and by car forever after
8406478 the moment a child is born the mother is also born she never existed before the woman existed but the mother never a mother is something absolutely new
8406479 making the decision to have a child is momentous it is to decide forever to have your heart go walking around outside your body
8406480 if there were no schools to take the children away from home part of the time the insane asylum would be filled with mothers
8406481 if evolution really works how come mothers only have two hands
8406482 its not easy being a mother if it were easy fathers would do it
8406483 the hand that rocks the cradle usually is attached to someone who isnt getting enough sleep
8406484 id like to be the ideal mother but im too busy raising my kids
8406485 most children threaten at times to run away from home this is the only thing that keeps some parents going
8406486 it is amazing how quickly the kids learn the operation of the dvd yet are unable to understand the vacuum cleaner

8406561 we are closer to world war iii than to november elections
8406562 we will drastically cut our diplomatic ties with russia up to consuls or envoys
8406563 but accounting for the fact that a great number of georgians live in russia there would probably be no such decision
8406564 saakashvili regime is absolutely out of step with the high standards established by the international community
8406565 the georgian people sooner or later will find worthy leaders capable of really caring about their country and who develop mutually respectful equal good relations with all caucasus nations russia will contribute to that in every possible way
8406566 a lot of times you dont think women my age have breast cancer
8406567 women have a close history of cancer in my family my older sister also currently has breast cancer my other sister died of ovarian cancer i have a brother who died of cancer so it definitely puts me in a high risk category
8406568 african american women we have a tendency to not finish treatment just because of the way it makes your feel or the changes you go through you just have a tendency to give up on it
8406569 one thing we talked to during her consultation is lifetime follow up and getting appropriate treatment and taking care of yourself not just having the cancer removed we talked about diet exercise examining yourself and being aware of your body

8406618 there were a lot of people who supported senator obama early and i was not one of them he understandably feels an amount of loyalty and obligation i am sure to make sure that they are given an opportunity especially if they risked a lot politically by coming out early for him

8406691 what concerns me today is that our council will most likely vote on this matter at the next council meeting and i think the votes are currently there for passing whatever dollar amount our elected leaders see fit as far as i see this matter itll have at least 3 solid votes for spending in franklin olson sohns and solomon
8406692 until i see an economic impact study with the benefits for the city of franklin i will not vote on this proposal
8406693 someone needs to figure out the benefit increase for each community
8406694 coming to the city of franklin for money at this point i dont think is appropriate oak creek officials havent approached any other players including south milwaukee and milwaukee county to involve them nor have they gone to the dot and fought the case that this is a regional issue
8406695 were not big in the line and this gives us a chance by leveling the playing field

8406742 at least 1 836 people lost their lives in hurricane katrina and in the subsequent floods making it the deadliest u s hurricane since the 1928 okeechobee hurricane the storm is estimated to have been responsible for 81 2 billion 2005 u s dollars in damage making it the costliest natural disaster in u s history the catastrophic failure of the flood protection in new orleans prompted immediate review of the army corps of engineers which has by congressional mandate sole responsibility for design and construction of the flood protection and levee systems there was also widespread criticism of the federal state and local governments reaction to the storm which resulted in an investigation by the u s congress and the resignation of federal emergency management agency director michael d brown
8406743 ninety percent of the residents of southeast louisiana were evacuated in the most successful evacuation of a major urban area in the nations history
8406744 despite promises of reform governments are rebuilding new orleans in large part with the same policies that failed in the past the levees will not adequately protect people living in the low lying areas and they wont even be ready until 2011 marshes swamps and barrier islands eroded by years of neglect and bad political decisions which are crucial to breaking up the storm surges of hurricanes are vanishing at the rate of two football fields every couple of hours lack of a decisive plan for rebuilding and better urban planning given the conditions of the geography

8406766 i appeal to the governing authorities in india to intervene to save the lives of the many who are being victimized in the current crisis
8406767 respect for the principle of religious liberty and the sacredness of human life requires nothing less
8406768 i also appeal to all baptists worldwide to pray gods protection for our brothers and sisters in orissa
8406769 y ou are aware that my chronic back condition is increasingly limiting my ability to work and travel
8406770 the inevitable day has come when i must tell you i am no longer physically able to do my job i cannot give abp the performance that it expects of its chief executive or i require of myself
8406771 for more than 10 years i have continued to do my job despite degenerative disc disease and failed back syndrome
8406772 chronic intractable pain now prevents me from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time for the past year and a half your encouragement and cooperation has allowed me to continue in this role while working from home despite those accommodations my health has continued to decline now resulting in cognitive impairments and depression that only amplify the effects of chronic pain
8406773 the surgery i face may temporarily slow the degeneration of my spine but my doctors tell me the natural course of this disease will produce only worse symptoms and more limitations so i am making the tough decisions now that will put me in the best position to manage the pain and give me the best chance to reclaim a healthy lifestyle
8406774 the associated baptist press board of directors is deeply saddened by gregs health issues that are forcing him to seek full disability
8406775 greg has provided the leadership to give abp a solid foundation and to prepare the organization to move forward in the ever changing world of journalism and religious media we know he will continue to support our work and someday we hope he can again write for abp
8406776 saying greg is a respected colleague is only the start of it for almost our whole adult lives hes been a traveling companion confidant soulmate and fellow baseball fan i cant imagine doing this work especially going to big baptist meetings without him i just love the guy
8406777 hes always been after the stories that explain faith and life and doing church
8406778 whether its covering baptists initial response to aids one of his early ground breaking news packages or church architecture the baptist battles or the impact of changing worship styles greg has helped all of us understand the context in which we share our faith we cant repay the debt we owe him
8406779 helped abp to emerge at a time when the southern baptist conventions news service was no longer willing or able to provide the kind of reliable news that baptists expected
8406780 greg shaped a press organization that has achieved excellence in detail and thoroughness
8406781 he exercised great courage in guiding a new organization out of the fragmentation of denominational controversy and schism
8406782 he is aggressive fair and above all honest he defines christian journalism he showed a baptist can report about baptist affairs with credibility his leadership gave abp a large national following he is the reason that abp has survived and succeeded for all these years
8406783 greg warner has played a historic role within the baptist family as the founding editor of associated baptist press
8406784 his commitment to a free baptist press and to journalistic integrity has been a valuable and valued contribution
8406785 from the time i first started on the religion beat greg was a great source and informative guide to the world of southern baptists
8406786 in his soft spoken way he provided insight and humor to what was often a rancorous story over time he became my friend as well
8406787 i consider greg to be a paragon of ethical enterprising and courageous journalism he is one of the people who has really stood up for the free flow and fearless flow of information about religious affairs in this country at a time when that is oh so necessary as it will continue to be
8406788 i believe he has made a great contribution to journalism in establishing associated baptist press and that will be an institution that i think will define him for many of us who have had the good good fortune to know him
8406789 i have learned from his stories and appreciated his professional presence in the newsroom of the annual southern baptist convention
8406790 i admire his ability to meet the demands and necessary diligence of journalism as he dealt with a most difficult condition and am sorry he has reached a point where he feels that is not currently possible
8406791 unnecessary extra biblical narrowing of parameters for southern baptist cooperation in the great commission the guidelines represent

8406797 cuando el editor de una revista o de un suplemento cultural permite al cr tico subirse a un podio y airear opiniones literarias en t rminos absolutos y sin las matizaciones aconsejadas por el respeto al trabajo ajeno resulta probable que levanten un revuelo por la quiebra de tolerancia la culpa del fracaso recae sobre quien legitima el desaguisado el editor

8406927 my internal clock is telling me all right lets go and ive still got a month to wait
8406928 i think theres a lot less to worry about in the nhl as coach and general manager in kitchener i oversaw every detail of training camp from travel to booking ice time to cutting players to scheduling exhibition games
8406929 at this level youve got people that do all those things you just coach
8406930 i always wanted to coach in the nhl i knew that
8406931 at the same time i wasnt in a rush to get there i really appreciated the level i was at
8406932 i really want to go in with a clean slate with this team
8406933 no pre conceived opinions on the players i really want to give them the opportunity in camp to come out and prove themselves regardless of whats happened in the past here or how theyve played and performed
8406934 when you dont make the playoffs for seven or eight years there is some baggage that gets dragged through year to year with you
8406935 were going to try and eliminate that and start fresh
8406936 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8406937 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8406938 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8406939 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8406940 they told joe take as much time as he needs there will always be a place here for you no pressure
8406941 for sure i was worrying and a bunch of us were worrying about what was going to happen because we know were a much better team when hes in the lineup now that he made the right decision everybodys pumped we know how much better we are when joes in
8406942 if you insist on a quick answer youre probably going to get the answer you dont want
8406943 if you insist on an answer now it might be no if you give me more time it might be yes
8406944 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother
8406945 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8406946 im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8406947 everybody was starting to worry what joe was going to do
8406948 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see

8406960 there are four virtues that we talked about that we wanted to bridge over from the super bowl championship team to the 2008 season
8406961 those virtues are courage persistence resilience and mental toughness defined as the perfectly disciplined will that refuses to give in
8406962 if that doesnt get your heart pumping and put the chills on the back of your neck i dont know what does
8406963 the most important word i heard in the video was the word we
8406964 we are a team it is team first we are the greatest example perhaps of all time of a team that believed in each other and would not let each other down thats the main reason i think that our rookie class did such a tremendous job for us down through the stretch because they were accountable to our great veteran leadership
8406965 no two seasons are ever the same no two teams are ever the same
8406966 but we started training camp off with a theme talk is cheap never satisfied that has worked very well for us
8406967 we set forth in training camp to build the foundation once again a foundation of solid solid fundamentals that will allow us along with the concept of team to handle anything that comes our way that we are confronted with in terms of adversity through the 2008 season we start out the season with the same premise in mind to try to again bind ourselves together to have the same kind of feeling of accountability the same kind of feeling of not letting each other down
8406968 permit me to remind everyone here who is in charge of miracles for the new york giants
8406969 i think it is a preseason fourth game we have played the patriots in this particular position the fourth preseason game all of the time that i have been here and it is the fourth preseason game and i think bill belichick will look at it just like we are looking at it
8406970 i dont know if its a rematch if it was in february i would say its a great rematch
8406971 but its august so its just another game for us to warm up and get ready for the most important game which is sept 4 the regular season opener vs washington
8406972 he made the best decision for him and his family
8406973 i didnt think he would come back i think hes very happy doing what hes doing now
8406974 when i talked to michael this offseason he was set in his mind that he was moving forward
8406975 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8406976 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8406977 acho que ela fez um discurso muito bom de seu ponto de vista e do nosso mas n o necessariamente do ponto de vista de barack obama

8406979 a senadora hillary fez sua campanha presid ncia deixando claro que barack obama n o est preparado para liderar como comandante em chefe

8406981 essa uma luta pelo futuro e uma luta que precisamos vencer
8406982 bom mas n o t o bom para barack obama em 2008 melhor ainda se as coisas mudarem como parecem para hillary clinton em 2012
8406983 o que faltou foi muito no sentido de uma descri o de barack obama que tipo de homem ele algu m que ap ia as mesmas posi es que ela
8406984 ser que ela olhou fundo em seu cora o e encontrou alguma coisa que valha a pena n o h sinal aqui de que ela tenha feito isso seria ele um bom comandante em chefe nenhuma palavra sobre isso como a campanha de mccain r pida e alegremente observou
8406985 a primeira vez desde 1976 que uma conven o ficava mais entusiasmada com um perdedor do que com um vencedor
8406986 esses dois em refer ncia ao casal clinton precisam de que obama perca e ir o fazer tudo que puderem depois de denver para ver o que acontece

8407009 today the kids are lucky because the camps are all over i want them to take advantage of the opportunity and absorb all the information they can get whether its from high school coaches college coaches current and former players or other instructors at our camp
8407010 but some of the others say whos that old man
8407011 i meet a lot of kids at these camps and when i see a kid who has the passion and drive i make sure i stay in contact with them throughout the year
8407012 they email me their schedule and let me know how theyre doing i tell them they have to work hard in the classroom and on the field sometimes the parents call me and ask me to talk to them so i have fun with that
8407013 if i had our equipment when i was still playing i might have been able to play for another year or two or three
8407014 in football and in life you have to be disciplined work hard and believe in yourself the same thing applies at home and in school so if you do those three things good things will happen to you its not always about who is the fastest or who is the best you can have all the talent in the world but if you dont show up on time and dont listen to the coach it will disrupt the whole chemistry of the team

8407038 i was just tired and i couldnt get up i was so exhausted at that moment i was breathing hard and i didnt have the energy to get up
8407039 i would have loved to you know take a nap on court because i was really exhausted but you know the rules are the rules i had to keep going
8407040 certainly the bad weather put us behind a few days and in some cases a couple weeks but with the good weather this week and last week were almost on schedule
8407041 were going to be ready for the first day of school well have some inconveniences with parking and the scaffolding for students to work around and it may impact some of our emergency drills fire drills things like that but all those plans are in place to share with teachers and staff
8407042 when youre dealing with old schools youre dealing with the possibility of discovering asbestos and we did so we had some additional asbestos abatement that we had to address
8407043 home prices are becoming inexpensive again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
8407044 many analysts do not expect the financial markets to improve significantly until home prices stop falling the pace of existing home sales remains low and available inventory relatively high both indicating that buyers are not yet able to step into the market at current prices
8407045 however that could change within a year home prices are becoming inexpensive again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
8407046 the median home price is now more inexpensive to the median household than at any time since the start of 2004 my analysis recommends that housing prices will have to fall a bit more but the housing market isnt far from being reasonably valued for the first time in five years
8407047 meanwhile rental costs have remained stable and apparently havent had any effect on housing prices independent of household income historically there have been wide swings in the capability of the median household to afford an average home
8407048 in contrast the cost of renting a primary residence has tracked the growth in median household income very closely
8407049 the price appreciation in a hypothetical reit portfolio has followed the same long term trajectory as home prices have during the past fourteen years although reits have been far more volatile from month to month and have had corrections 1997 1999 and 2002 that housing prices did not experience
8407050 apartment reits are actually positive for 2008 thats consistent with the notion that housing prices are near their lows
8407051 the implication of this is that real estate investors should look to get back in for long term holdings
8407052 recommended reit exchange traded funds to purchase on market dips include the rez which yields 4 7 and which can be bought at 388 a share or below
8407053 excited to be a part of the lakers and have the opportunity to show what he can do for them
8407054 i think there are a couple of things that go through teams minds when their coach is replaced some feel terribly sorry for him some see it as a rebirth of their own personal hope
8407055 what i wanted them to know was it wasnt so much a new coach as another bruin who was very much excited to try to take ucla football back to a place of prominence
8407056 ive been around teams without huge amounts of talent that have played like great teams just because they believed they could
8407057 thats where it started and thats where it will stay as long as ive got the chance to be in charge here because ive seen it work and know it can work again
8407058 you have to be aggressive you have to have swagger to play this game
8407059 the coaches kind of bring that to the table for us we just take it off the table eat it and run with it at practice hopefully well do that in the games too
8407060 you definitely see a change in the culture and the mindset here at ucla because i think coach neuheisel is more of a personality than coach dorrell was
8407061 thats not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing but he just brings more energy to the team that has really been infectious
8407062 i told our team i want you to match the coaching staffs intensity
8407063 i want you to match what were feeling because thats how the game is going to be played
8407064 they needed to get out of the way of those who were interested it would be unfair to not have everybody going in the same direction
8407065 amount of push you put on a returning show like csi or greys anatomy is much less
8407066 you do it in a much different way and all you really have to do is tell viewers that its back

8407073 we finally have a potential therapy for preventing vision loss from dry amd
8407074 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance
8407075 this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8407076 collectively these studies highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by sirna based therapies
8407077 it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes
8407078 so far as the nice treaty is concerned the irish people have spoken and like it or lump it the commission and its president have to accept it they should do so with more good grace than they have shown in the recent past the nice treaty no matter what its good intentions is a document that has been democratically tested in only one member state and that is ireland it failed to meet the democratic test in this nation it is an arrogance for any politician either here or any commissioner in europe to ignore the fundamental fact that the irish people have spoken with some clarity on the matter yet last night the president of the commission suggested that somehow or other the irish peoples will can be undone if the commission its leaders or the governments of other european states decide to sweep democracy aside we must ask on what basis is the future of europe to be built over the past two days i attended a meeting of the interim european security and defence assembly i was amazed and gratified in equal measure at the response by european parliamentarians from 28 different european nations to the irish referendum it was an interesting and extraordinary eye opener there was no finger wagging or suggestion that our people had been wrong or were confused rather there was a degree of admiration for the decision the irish had made speakers from the united kingdom to slovenia to greece spoke on the issue they indicated their support for the right of the irish people to make a decision on this matter they were by no means all euro sceptics speakers from a number of countries both within and outside the union indicated that the irish people by its vote reflected a common view and concern that now exists both within the eu and in those states most proximate to the eu members from the eu states who contributed directly in the debate or who spoke privately to the irish delegation members indicated that it was their view i made an effort to do a straw poll that referenda on the nice treaty as it currently stands if held in other member states would meet with the same public response as in ireland there is something distinctly odd about democratic states attempting to take decisions that are out of line with the sentiment of their citizens the gulf that exists between the citizens of europe and the institutions the commissioners and the bureaucrats who are now driving the union is nowhere more visible than in the area of peace security and defence in the run up to the nice treaty the european council decided quite incredibly that somehow the european union could now take charge of peace security and defence issues across the continent of europe both within and outside the union the issues raised by the rejection of the nice treaty in the referendum are of a fundamental nature i have listened with some dismay to todays debate and the debate that has taken place in the weeks since the referendum many in the political leadership of the nation are more focused on making a political point about the referendum than on truly addressing the core issues behind the judgement passed by the people it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes to attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront something fundamental will have to be changed in the nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again the nice treaty is a complex document which intends to achieve complex things it was sold to the irish people as a means of providing for the enlargement of the european union last night mr prodi made it very clear that was not what the treaty is about he did not however make clear precisely what it is about he was saying therefore that the enlargement process could be achieved without the nice treaty i mentioned the assembly i attended yesterday and the considerable interest shown in the decision of the irish people some thought provoking contributors indicated that the opportunity afforded the irish people should also be offered to the citizens of other member states maybe then europe would get a clear message about what the people of europe expect in the coming years
8407079 it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes

8407085 nevertheless the debate did bring to an end the long and thorough period of trialling evaluation analysis and consultation
8407086 we will now take steps to reintroduce the 32 tasers to the three auckland districts and the wellington district before that can happen the tasers will need to be retrofitted with cameras and appropriate refresher training undertaken it will therefore be several months before the tasers will make an appearance as a tactical weapon option

8407149 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8407150 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8407151 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8407152 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8407153 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base

8407173 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person

8407190 because of this development the involvement of a non member of the judiciary we referring to the office of the ombudsman should secure the transcript
8407191 there is no harm for the ombudsman to monitor and secure all the documents at the end of the hearing there will be a basis to evaluate what appropriate measures the ombudsman must take

8407194 the fighting resulted in the killings of almost 20 civilians that had not been covered by the media
8407195 if they directly attack if they have arms then they are considered combatants
8407196 now that fighting has shifted to moro areas we hear of insufficient time given to civilians to vacate their villages before afp bombardment begins we hear of food blockades against internally displaced people we hear of ngos being prevented from delivering urgently needed relief items and media personalities being prevented from covering the humanitarian crisis

8407205 it was purely partisan red meat on a pocketbook issue exactly what some democratic strategists have said was lacking from the convention when the sagging economy is at the forefront of voters minds
8407206 his appearance in a coveted time slot during network television coverage easily overshadowed a staid keynote address delivered earlier by former virginia gov mark r warner a senate candidate who was expected to play a starring role here and it couldnt have come at a better time for the democrats just when barack obama needs to start connecting with the kind of white rural and working class voters that might be inclined to listen to schweitzer
8407207 schweitzers montana miracle in which democrats took back the governors seat after 16 years and ended 12 years of republican majorities in both state chambers has been cited as evidence that the republican bastions in the western states are losing ground to a new democratic brand of libertarian tinged prairie populism

8407241 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8407242 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8407243 hopefully i can play even better in the next round
8407244 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8407245 but in a certain moment i felt big pain so i had to get it taped
8407246 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8407247 i was concerned i was going to get my dress dirty
8407248 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired

8407258 we had a lot of feedback from the 2004 convention that activities during the day were pretty boring but that the bloggers enjoyed hanging out together

8407262 were getting access to the podium to the floor there really arent many places that are off limits
8407263 a lot of people find the traditional media very stale very programmed
8407264 our readers are looking for something more than a 30 second soundbite on important issues
8407265 blogs have become important because theres been a declining trust in the mainstream media particularly in the lack of hard hitting reporting in the run up to the iraq war
8407266 that combined with the new availability of tools that allows anyone to publish and create their own audience which didnt exist before

8407278 we have been struggling for goals but i was never really worried it is difficult when you start the season with a champions league qualifier and an international
8407279 i was here on tuesday and they were talking about a crisis at arsenal
8407280 someone said it was the best time to play them after they lost to fulham but it was the worst time
8407281 fabregas is a big player he makes arsenal tick once you see him on the teamsheet its going to be hard
8407282 we played with belief and competed with them in the first leg we didnt do that here
8407283 we are hurt and disappointed its not how we expect twente to play we must take that anger into saturdays match when the season starts

8407306 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8407307 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in

8407477 certainly the more you drink the less disturbing reality is its a brilliant philosophy thus we are going to the pub we shall test this theory to the limits with the best wines we can find
8407478 the people related to me dont want to do this
8407479 all the secrecy and omerta is not about what information they were getting its about how defendant pellicano was getting it
8407480 ladies and gentlemen context and common sense this is not a wiretap case
8407481 unnecessary packaging can be found in almost every retailer loose fruit individually shrink wrapped or on plastic trays in supermarkets the prolific use of plastic carrier bags and the mountains of plastic bottles used for cosmetic products are all contributing to the growing environmental crisis
8407482 packaging is rubbish and for too long we have had to suffer excessive amounts of it
8407483 now that the true financial and environmental costs are becoming obvious customers are challenging manufacturers and retails to cut the wrap companies like ours need to think outside the box and present customers with innovations that allow them buy truly naked products
8407484 there are lots of people who go to school for seven years tommy theyre called doctors
8407485 look lady youre not worthy of my time but if you have something tasty then ill think about it

8407495 i just came from a meeting with hillary and all her delegates
8407496 according to the schedule i have from the press room the nominating process will take place from 3 5 montain time 2 5 pacific
8407497 i will let you know that my party my party loathes me much more than your party the democratic party loathes me
8407498 what about your party whats your party david shuster david whats your party
8407499 oh i feel so comforted by the fact that youre independent i bet everyone at msnbc has independent on their voting cards
8407500 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
8407501 for the first tim ein my adult life i am proud of my country
8407502 chollet tries to argue that an obama administration will follow the same centrist foreign policy that president clinton pursued in his second term which he characterizes as resting on three pillars embracing globalization and trade promoting democracy and developing a concept on the use of force that turned the usual liberal debate about using military power on its head instead of the burden of proof falling on those advocating intervention the burden fell on those who advocated doing nothing in the face of aggression as we saw in the balkans
8407503 although this is a fair characterization of the way the clinton administration saw the world in the late 1990s it bears little resemblance to where the democratic party is today
8407504 first with regard to trade chollet acknowledges that obama and biden have criticized some of the specifics of trade agreements but have been steadfast defenders of an open global economy
8407505 chollet s next point point although strong critics of the iraq war obama and biden are hardly doves they have called for doing more to end the genocide in darfur and have advocated the use of force to kill osama bin laden in pakistan
8407506 and the final kicker and obama and biden have made clear that they believe the u s must remain a steadfast defender of democracy around the world as their response to the georgia crisis demonstrates
8407507 perhaps derek wasn t paying attention but obama s initial response to the georgia crisis was to apportion blame

8407509 were proud of the additions to the keller isd athletics complex
8407510 many other districts have chosen to have more grandiose press boxes but we simply wanted to assure we have an adequate work space for visiting coaches scouts and members of the media
8407511 it has been the highest honor to coach for the united states
8407512 i wouldnt trade it for a minute the experiences i have had through usa softball and more importantly the relationships i have made with athletes and staff are wonderful
8407513 its been a tremendous ride and blessing to be a part of all of this but i am ready to settle down and begin my life at home and allow someone else this honor
8407514 well probably be able to have a little bit more fun because there are four other people to take this ride with me and we can all blame each other for any failure
8407515 shes a tough new yorker with a lot of candor
8407516 part of the beauty and satisfaction of this new award is the fact that simon cant win it it makes me happy
8407517 the judges on all of these shows are very important characters and frankly are lead on many of them absolutely they should be acknowledged for what they do and i think that perhaps well see that happen but to go back to my statement in the envelope issue it does make me feel good just between simon and i that i dont have to deal with the possibility of him winning one individually and taking all of the credit
8407518 that would be probst although he mightve walked in with his open toed sandals
8407519 what we do is similar in some ways but its very different the mechanics of what howies doing running a game show and what im doing with music competition and what jeffs doing in the bush in the middle of insert continent here its all different but im personally happy that were at least grouped into the category
8407520 we used to get excited when you hear am american idol maybe but its am azing race so i think weve conditioned ourselves to pretty much stay in our seats and watch the bruckheimer army go up and accept but they deserve to be acknowledged and rewarded for the success of that show its just all very different
8407521 the mechanics of hosting the emmys for me is much like the mechanics of hosting american idol because we do a big live event type show twice a week
8407522 at the emmys were honoring those people who are part of television all year long
8407523 the trickiest part for me last year was balancing the preshow and the main show i had to focus on both of those and hope nobody sees me sweat this year with all the guys and heidi we dont take ourselves too seriously thats the idea and the approach for this show too
8407524 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade if he were to come to you and say help me out here madame speaker when does life begin what would you tell him
8407525 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8407526 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8407527 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions this isnt about abortion on demand its about a careful careful consideration of all factors and to that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
8407528 the catholic church at the moment feels very strongly that it begins at the point of conception
8407529 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8407530 here is what the catechism of the catholic church says human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8407531 it also says since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable looks like pelosi didnt study the subject long enough but not to worry we are sending her a copy of catholicism for dummies today
8407532 its the blind leading the blind in that party if the ardent practicing catholic doesnt care when life begins only that women have the choice to do what they choose sometimes thanks to people like pelosi not aware of what their choices actually are whether its life or not
8407533 my republican colleagues do not support contraception if you want to reduce the number of abortions and we all do we must it would behoove you to support family planning and and contraception you would think

8407539 hes one of our main guys but we dont think its a season ending injury
8407540 the time frame it fluctuates but hopefully with his youth and hes been pretty durable and resilient to injury hopefully he does get back soon
8407541 with the offseason moves we made hopefully we can still play at a high level this year to me its more something that you look at as a challenge and you dont let it defeat you you deal with it
8407542 training camp was going to be an important part of his development
8407543 thats going to be postponed obviously but hes got a lot of development on and off the court that hes going to continue to do ive got a lot of confidence in him and now his job is to get healthy

8407546 ideally id like everybody here in oakland all the time but thats not realistic i think one thing monta has done each and every year is improve and i do believe most improvement is made during the summer thats when guys do get better so i cant debate that
8407547 south ossetian independence is a joke we are talking about a smugglers paradise of 60 000 people financed by the russian security services no one can seriously consider that as an independent state
8407548 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8407549 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8407550 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet

8407552 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8407553 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8407554 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8407555 its close but it feels like youre a long ways away
8407556 you feel like you can be anywhere in the world
8407557 its in the top five places to ride in this area theres some obstacles but thats what makes it fun
8407558 if you think about mapping those controls and all those different type of buttons that you have to a console without a keyboard for chatting its a very challenging proposition
8407559 i mean we love console games also and im sure there will be a successful mmo sometime on a console so it has nothing to do with that its just more like a square peg round hole thing for our game it just wasnt designed with that in mind

8407586 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8407587 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8407588 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8407589 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8407590 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8407591 its our responsibility to galvanize the public opinion into an experience that will reach elected officials and people aspiring toward elected office

8407629 i wish to add my name to the long list of people who have been shocked and outraged by the awarding of the order of canada to dr henry morgentaler
8407630 it is utterly abhorrent to so many of us that a person who has done so much to promote and facilitate abortion should be given the highest honor of our country
8407631 i assume that the purpose of creating the order of canada was to draw us together as a nation by honoring those whose life and work promote the values and ideals that unite us
8407632 i can assure you that awarding the order of canada to dr henry morgentaler is having the exact opposite result
8407633 revision of the selection procedures so that this important symbol of canada can be salvaged

8407645 this was the managements responsibility they created an environment that simply was uninhabitable

8407648 spirit lake is one of my favorite places to go onlocation in the summer

8407650 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8407651 on friday august 31 2001 the sunshine seemed to dim laughter faded away and there was a little less joy in the world because deputy hagop jake kuredjian was taken from us a deranged man wielding a rifle took his life in a brief moment of time leaving his family and an army of friends to mourn his loss in the short time since his tragic death at 40 years old i have been overwhelmed by the stories of how much life jake packed into the relatively short time he was with us if friends were counted as income jake was one of the richest men in the world while we cant help but grieve his passing i am determined to remember that million dollar smile and the fact he would give the shirt off his back to help a family member friend or stranger let us remember jake enjoying a good prank telling a joke or riding down the road on his harley please never forget that jake willingly put his life at risk to come to the aid of residents and law enforcement personnel who were in peril most of all if you have not already done so thank god for sharing jake with us even if just for a little while
8407652 the positives are youre going to get noticed youre going to get some attention
8407653 but if you get that much attention then people are going to be watching and looking for something to get you into trouble and thats going to get blamed on my dad too its just something you always have to be conscious of
8407654 sometimes on tv i might turn on a game or something like that but i wont go looking for it
8407655 ive never seen him play at notre dame ive never asked him about it ive heard the stories but i never really asked to see the film or anything like that
8407656 initially i went to delasalle because i thought i was going to play basketball but then i realized how much i missed football
8407657 she kept pointing at me and saying look at your dad
8407658 i didnt know how much they ran the ball until then
8407659 we did a good job of getting a lead so i played the third or fourth quarters
8407660 im still trying to play catch up from my high school years honestly i thought i was going to be so far behind im happy that he has that confidence in me im just trying to get on the bus
8407661 he told me that before so its something to look forward to
8407662 it helps me realize that ive got to be patient
8407663 i definitely thought about that but i figured im still going to be compared to my dad no matter where i go
8407664 i feel sad that i dont know what happened to her i am sure her family would love to have some closure so would i
8407665 its never dawned on me that she might be dead
8407666 i always thought she might be in trouble i think i have always believed that she ran for her life
8407667 but there was something wrong with the guy his stories often changed
8407668 there was some conjecture that he tried to burn the body
8407669 it looked like as if you had dug a hole and filled it up
8407670 there was a lot to point to it being john
8407671 out of the blue a strange woman shows up and says she wanted to adopt only those cats

8407673 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8407674 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8407675 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8407676 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8407677 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base
8407678 some one decides to delete my message you re damn rught
8407679 we cannot tell you how peaceful and precious our moments were there such perfect solitude and all around nature dancing the family times were priceless what a great place to practice harp too thanks again for making it possible
8407680 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8407681 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8407682 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8407683 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8407684 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8407685 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8407686 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8407687 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8407688 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8407689 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8407690 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8407691 its not what someone knows that can be dangerous but its what they know for sure that just aint so

8407721 the advantage for aiocdl is the higher margins they can earn by cutting down number of distributors however chemists under aiocdl can substitute these respective drugs for doctors prescribed drugs due to higher margins offered to them though the drugs have the labels of well known mncs patients and doctors will not object the substitution

8407818 i thank all our congressional delegation especially senators kennedy and kerry and representatives barney frank bill delahunt and john tierney for obtaining these funds and for working with my team to make sure they get into the hands of massachusetts fishermen hard hit by federal fishing restrictions
8407819 i look forward to working with them and the fishing industry on a more sustainable approach to fisheries management that both protects our natural resources and supports our coastal communities
8407820 the over 1 500 miles of massachusetts coastline and the communities located there are not just part of our history and identity but a vital part of our economy contributing upwards of 2 billion each year in fisheries economic activity
8407821 preserving and promoting our fishing industry are important parts of the patrick murray administrations economic agenda
8407822 fishing is a longstanding part of the commonwealths history and our fishing ports are an integral part of the states economy so its gratifying to see that fishermen will receive this much needed aid to help them during these difficult times
8407823 this funding will help thousands of massachusetts fishermen and their families who have been struggling because of strict federal regulations
8407824 the aid will provide much needed financial breathing room while groundfish stocks recover i am proud to have worked with senator kennedy the rest of the massachusetts congressional delegation and governor patrick to make sure this assistance gets directly into the hands of those who need it most
8407825 i am pleased the federal government recognized the importance of helping a vital industry in the commonwealth while we all work to create a long term fisheries management plan that truly works
8407826 governor patrick secretary bowles senate president murray legislators representing coastal regions and our congressional delegation deserve our praise and thanks for their continued hard work on this important issue
8407827 the award of this relief funding is great news for the massachusetts ground fishermen
8407828 they are an important part of our history and our economy and we must do everything we can to protect their industry this money will go a long way toward reducing the financial stress that our fishing communities and families have had to endure
8407829 i am very grateful to governor patrick senator kennedy senator kerry and our representatives in congress for obtaining this emergency assistance for our struggling fishing families
8407830 this financial relief will be much appreciated by captains crews and families up and down the massachusetts coast who make their livings from the sea

8407985 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8407986 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8407987 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8407988 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8407989 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base

8408049 everyone was asking me before what it was going to be like i was like i dont know i havent talked to her in 10 or 15 years i had that tension and i started to let it get to me is she going to be nice is it going to be a bad environment but when i saw her everything was fine
8408050 i think when youre 18 your personalities conflict then you meet up 10 or 15 years later and the playing ground is totally different and youre fine
8408051 it let me find a little bit of peace and discover who i was as a person
8408052 not the person who the press made me out to be because id had a few bad experiences in my personal life and i was struggling to figure out a bad husband or a bad boyfriend and i was doing it under the spotlight so i wasnt reacting well to any of it

8408096 its still 99 8 percent muslim whether its a general that sits in the top chair or whether its the president theres not going to be a dramatic difference in how the church is treated we hope for more freedom we hope for safety for our christian brothers and sisters i think its not going to make a dramatic difference
8408097 one of our staff members has been in contact with mauritanian christians they had received threatening letters from the islamic committee who were watching the ministry that was going on and they were prepared to take action to stop the action from going forth
8408098 we have a ministry center that is reaching out to all those neighboring provinces including south ossetia this is a huge catastrophe for so many people
8408099 that god would give wisdom and guidance how to deal with this crisis and how our national workers would find the resources and be available to all of these refugee families but also to give for this ministry to reach out to families who lost everything
8408100 i think its remarkable that on the occasion of the olympics that the president of the united states no less than three times in an independent secular interview brought up the issue of religious liberty and brought it up particularly with the president of china
8408101 believers in china especially unregistered believers are still regularly harassed and persecuted by the authorities in a lot of locations around china our estimates are over 700 protestant pastors last year were arrested for some period of time simply for normal church activity
8408102 its still too early to say how thats going to develop though but theres always the potential of a humanitarian crisis and we will just pray that the churches will be ready and able to step into situation like that to help if its needed
8408103 pray for the protection of the evangelical churches that are there and are ministering just pray that even through this crisis that the lord will be able to use this to be able to find an open door for the gospel
8408104 the reason that church leaders are in the positions of being threatened is because usually theyre in places where they are advocating change its islamic leaders focusing their attacks on christian leaders
8408105 pray that they will be bold and be strong be thankful that we have seen in these situations where even in these climates of threat and of violence that leaders have actually become bolder and stood up and recognized the need for strong church leaders in these kinds of environments

8408116 my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8408117 so how do we give this country back to them
8408118 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8408119 my friends it is time to take back the country we love
8408120 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal health care helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8408121 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8408122 i will always be grateful to everyone from all fifty states puerto rico and the territories who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the bush administration
8408123 to my supporters my champions my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits from the bottom of my heart thank you
8408124 along the way america lost two great democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight one of our finest young leaders arkansas democratic party chair bill gwatney who believed with all his heart that america and the south could be and should be democratic from top to bottom and congresswoman stephanie tubbs jones a dear friend to many of us a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make america fairer and smarter stronger and better steadfast in her beliefs a fighter of uncommon grace she was an inspiration to me and to us all our heart goes out to stephanies son mervyn jr and bills wife rebecca who traveled to denver to join us at our convention
8408125 jobs lost houses gone falling wages rising prices the supreme court in a right wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock the biggest deficit in our nations history money borrowed from the chinese to buy oil from the saudis putin and georgia iraq and iran
8408126 i ran for president to renew the promise of america to rebuild the middle class and sustain the american dream to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded to save for college a home and retirement to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month
8408127 to create a health care system that is universal high quality and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance
8408128 to create a world class education system and make college affordable again
8408129 to fight for an america defined by deep and meaningful equality from civil rights to labor rights from womens rights to gay rights from ending discrimination to promoting unionization to providing help for the most important job there is caring for our families to help every child live up to his or her god given potential
8408130 to make america once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws
8408131 to bring fiscal sanity back to washington and make our government an instrument of the public good not of private plunder
8408132 making our government an instrument of private good not of public plunder
8408133 to restore americas standing in the world to end the war in iraq bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans
8408134 and to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming
8408135 most of all i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years
8408136 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8408137 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8408138 ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country
8408139 we need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of american confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity creativity and innovative spirit there are no limits to what is possible in america
8408140 this wont be easy progress never is but it will be impossible if we dont fight to put a democrat in the white house
8408141 we need to elect barack obama because we need a president who understands that america cant compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas we need a president who understands that we cant solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy
8408142 barack obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy he built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up not the top down he knows government must be about we the people not we the favored few no barack obama began his career as part of the corrupt chicago political machine get it right if change must start from the ground up why is it so vital to elect bho isnt he supposed to be the top guy i guess the people matter more in bhos mind government is only about we the favoured few
8408143 and when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time democrats know how to do this as i recall president clinton and the democrats did it before and president obama and the democrats will do it again
8408144 hell transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new clean energy future hell make sure that middle class families get the tax relief they deserve and i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8408145 barack obama will end the war in iraq responsibly and bring our troops home a first step to repairing our alliances around the world
8408146 and he will have with him a terrific partner in michelle obama anyone who saw michelles speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for america
8408147 americans are also fortunate that joe biden will be at barack obamas side he is a strong leader and a good man he understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad he is pragmatic tough and wise and of course joe will be supported by his wonderful wife jill
8408148 now john mccain is my colleague and my friend he has served our country with honor and courage but we dont need four more years of the last eight years more economic stagnation and less affordable health care more high gas prices and less alternative energy more jobs getting shipped overseas and fewer jobs created here more skyrocketing debt home foreclosures and mounting bills that are crushing our middle class families more war less diplomacy more of a government where the privileged come first and everyone else comes last
8408149 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its ok when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8408150 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8408151 but remember before we can keep going we have to get going by electing barack obama president
8408152 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8408153 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day and think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation weve got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honors the sacrifices of all who came before us and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope
8408154 that is our duty to build that bright future and to teach our children that in america there is no chasm too deep no barrier too great and no ceiling too high for all who work hard never back down always keep going have faith in god in our country and in each other
8408155 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8408156 the systematic beliefs of the mass public estimating policy preferences with survey data

8408167 you can talk until your blue in the face actions will always speak louder than any words ever could
8408168 no time for on the job training mccain will bring a lifetime of experience obama will bring a speech that he gave in 2002
8408169 i dont want to wake up four years from now and discover that we still have more young black men in prison than in college
8408170 theres a strong overlap between gang affiliation and young men of color i think its problematic for them to be singled out as more likely to receive the death penalty for carrying out certain acts than are others who do the same thing
8408171 there is really no proof or indication that automatic transfers and increased penalties and adult penalties for juvenile offenses have in fact proven to be more effective in reducing juvenile crime or cutting back on recidivism
8408172 america is not what it once was what it used to be

8408220 elaborare modalit per conferire nuovo impeto alla missione evangelizzatrice della chiesa inculturando la dottrina sociale nel contesto africano
8408221 come nel caso del primo congresso continentale svoltosi a citt del messico nel novembre del 2005 per il continente americano e del secondo tenutosi nel gennaio del 2007 a bangkok in thailandia per lasia anche questo terzo incontro sar dedicato alla presentazione del compendio della dottrina sociale della chiesa cattolica pubblicato nel 2004
8408222 al servo di dio giovanni paolo ii che ha affermato ha sostenuto con coraggio la pubblicazione del compendio e a papa benedetto xvi che nella sua prima lettera enciclica deus caritas est parla del compendium come lo strumento di riferimento pi autorevole per ispirare lopera volta a ottenere un ordine sociale pi giusto
8408223 se lannuncio della giustizia e della pace parte integrante del compito di evangelizzazione ne deriva che la promozione di questi valori dovr anche far parte del programma pastorale di ciascuna comunit cristiana ecco perch insisto sulla necessit di formare tutti gli operatori pastorali in modo adeguato in vista di tale apostolato
8408224 come corpo organizzato allinterno della comunit e della nazione la chiesa ha il diritto e il dovere di partecipare pienamente alledificazione di una societ giusta e pacifica con tutti i mezzi a sua disposizione nella misura in cui con queste sue attivit contribuisce a ridurre lignoranza a migliorare la salute pubblica e a favorire una maggiore partecipazione di tutti ai problemi della societ in spirito di libert e di corresponsabilit la chiesa crea le condizioni per il progresso della giustizia e della pace
8408225 indica la strada che luomo deve seguire in questo mondo per entrare nel regno di dio il suo insegnamento quindi si estende a tutto lordine morale e soprattutto alla giustizia che deve regolare le relazioni umane ci parte della predicazione del vangelo
8408226 il soggetto adeguato alla dottrina sociale non nientaltro che tutta la comunit ecclesiale
8408227 la dottrina sociale della chiesa perch la chiesa il soggetto che la elabora la diffonde e la insegna
8408228 tutta la comunit ecclesiale sacerdoti religiosi e laici concorre a costituire la dottrina sociale la diversit di compiti carismi e ministeri al suo interno
8408229 la chiesa vede nelluomo in ogni uomo limmagine vivente di dio stesso
8408230 uomini e donne che nelle circostanze concrete della storia sono il cuore e lanima del pensiero sociale cattolico e tutta la dottrina sociale della chiesa infatti si sviluppa a partire dal principio che afferma la dignit inviolabile della persona umana
8408231 annunciare cristo dunque rivelare alluomo la sua dignit inalienabile che dio ha riscattato mediante lincarnazione del suo unico figlio
8408232 luomo non pu vivere in condizioni di vita sociale economica culturale e politica infra umane ecco il fondamento teologico delle lotta per la difesa della dignit personale per la giustizia e la pace sociale per la promozione umana la liberazione e lo sviluppo integrale delluomo e di ogni uomo
8408233 questo principio deve essere il soggetto il fondamento e il fine ultimo di tutta lazione sociale e di ogni progetto di sviluppo
8408234 il principio personalista deve trovare espressione concreta nella promozione della dignit umana a ogni livello contro ogni tipo di discriminazione sia essa economica politica linguistica razziale religiosa o di qualsiasi altro tipo
8408235 non un sentimento di vaga compassione o di vacua angoscia per le disgrazie di cos tante persone sia vicine sia lontane ma al contrario si tratta di una determinazione ferma e perseverante a impegnarsi per il bene comune ovvero per il bene di tutti e di ciascuno perch siamo tutti realmente responsabili di chiunque altro
8408236 la conferenza di lambeth 2008 non stato un momento per formulare nuove leggi o decisioni vincolanti nonostante il modo in cui alcuni partecipanti hanno espresso le loro aspettative la conferenza ha delineato con fermezza una necessit prioritaria la nostra comunione che per il momento stata la ricostruzione di relazioni il ripristino della fiducia nellaltro e della fiducia nella nostra identit anglicana
8408237 di molti dei nostri colleghi i quali non hanno voluto condividere il nostro essere insieme
8408238 nostro desiderio di costruire ponti e ripristinare la nostra comunione
8408239 in primo luogo si legge nella lettera vi stata una confortante unit circa la necessit per la chiesa di svolgere pienamente il suo ruolo in tutto il mondo per la lotta contro la povert lignoranza e la malattia
8408240 per favorire questa prospettiva stato convenuto si legge ancora nella lettera che abbiamo bisogno di una capacit molto maggiore di comunione per coordinare il lavoro nel settore dello sviluppo

8408253 il concetto di tolleranza aiuta i credenti a comprendere nel loro rapporto con i non credenti o con i credenti di altre religioni che devono rivedere ragionevolmente il loro persistente disaccordo per dallaltro lato nel quadro di una politica cultura liberale i non credenti si sforzano di accettare questa stessa possibilit nel rapporto con i credenti
8408254 necessario liberarsi dellidea enormemente falsa che la fede non abbia nulla da dire agli uomini di oggi perch contraddice il loro concetto umanista di ragione di illuminismo e di libert
8408255 preoccupazione della chiesa cattolica per la difficolt nel mondo moderno di trovare un denominatore comune di principi morali condivisi da tutti basati sulla costituzione stessa delluomo e della societ che possano servire come criteri di base per legiferare sui problemi fondamentali che riguardano i diritti e i doveri di ogni uomo

8408295 the study of islam and muslims needs to be centralised into the schools and higher education curricula and taught in ways that meet the demands of our multicultural society
8408296 the studies should not be taught in isolation or in an insular atmosphere as that would merely continue to peddle the us and them attitudes that need to disappear once and for all
8408297 it is clearly the case that most british non muslims and that includes many people in scotland do not understand what makes muslims tick so it is important for more people to find out education is the key for this

8408334 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
8408335 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
8408336 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8408337 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8408338 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
8408339 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8408340 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available

8408360 thats what both those films have done in casino royale and batman begins they stripped it back down to the beginning and what appealed at the very conception
8408361 what happens with things that exist for a long time is they become augmented
8408362 and gimmicky and things change and they kind of theyre added to and added to and added to to try and make them better and it ends up just toppling over under the weight of its own sort of self parody whereas this is really getting back to it
8408363 i know theres some consternation within the fanbase but theyre gonna see new star trek with the original cast
8408364 i dont know whats not to be f ing excited about i am and im in it and its in the hands of a person who really cares about it we had advisors on set the whole time if we needed to know what happened on a if there was an away mission and only a certain amount of people went then who carried the tricorder we got it all from the people that really know
8408365 j j abrams was absolutely at pains to make sure that its totally and utterly and theres a lot in it for the fan theres a lot of little ironies in there that youll pick up on if you know the series and you know the mythology its going to be crackin
8408366 obviously j j s star trek is going to be its going to have j j s stamp on it
8408367 itll be like itll be contemporary and gritty but itll be its very much star trek the bridge was the bridge it was incredible but somehow it didnt look like it was built in the 60s the production design was so cleverly pitched in that it was completely credible but still very much like youd expect its very clever i dont know if i should have said that
8408368 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
8408369 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
8408370 sometimes being here at duke because weve been very very successful they expect you to be perfect they dont look at process anymore
8408371 part of that then becomes you win and sometimes youre just relieved to win
8408372 im not saying that it happens all the time but it happens at the end of that spain game most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated it was euphoric it was the way it should be thats the way its going to be for the rest of my career here at duke
8408373 each one of the coaches brings such a wealth of knowledge to the table and for a young coach to obviously be around coach k every day is an amazing opportunity
8408374 but to be around some of the other top coaches in the world and be able to pick their brains and learn the game through their eyes is just a wonderful opportunity
8408375 doing those two things at the same time afforded me an amazing opportunity to grow
8408376 throughout this time there have been sometimes articles you should do this you shouldnt theres no way that i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach im a better coach to them a better person as a result and when i was coaching them it was that we didnt go to the during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason shame on you you dont do that thats wrong the people who wrote about those things they were wrong
8408377 were going to go after it were going to do it and if some student doesnt go to the

8408380 this landmark agreement sets a new industrywide precedent that will force companies to disclose the true financial risks that climate change poses to their investors
8408381 will enhance our already aggressive efforts to be responsible environmental stewards
8408382 as long as they keep calling you you have to come

8408389 hopefully ill get some family and friends out there to watch
8408390 im still kind of settling and trying to do a lot and nothings for certain

8408393 im pretty sure theyve got a good idea of who they like
8408394 youre human you think about hey whats going on but i dont let that get to me im going to do all i can do and i cant control any of that
8408395 agreed to conclude their patent litigation at the u s court of appeals for the federal circuit and have entered into a new business agreement to explore the inclusion of immersion technology in playstation format products

8408399 perhaps the most important young writers in musical theatre today
8408400 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8408401 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8408402 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
8408403 insert into tblrecord recordid recordversion projectname department originalsubmitdate recordstatement rank identifiedby recorddetail values
8408404 oh you usually insult me right off i didnt recognize you
8408405 dummy thats not the aggressive type of retort that ive come to expect you okay
8408406 i just heard a rumor that the roxy is closing
8408407 well yeah there have always been rumors of the roxy closing its sort of part of the places charm
8408408 thats awesome to hear it seems like the rumors of its demise have always been around
8408409 ha you made a funny twinkle toes but you might be right see there used to be a theater called the roxy way up at 49th and seventh a big gigantic place that was the shit up until they build radio city music hall in fact the rockettes used to be the roxyettes until they left the roxy for radio city
8408410 always with the interruptions you anyway when the roxy theatre was demolished in 1960 there was this mega famous picture of gloria swanson in a feather boa being all glam in the theaters ruins
8408411 good luck with pretty obscure maybe the library would have a copy of the old issue of time when it ran
8408412 my guess is that the drag queens probably hold a reverence for that classic picture and would love to recreate it cant you just see lypsinka in a feather boa with a disco ball hanging in the ruins
8408413 i dont know who that is but i can just hear those queens starting rumors throughout the years
8408414 thanks kitten regardless its good to hear the roxy is still going strong
8408415 thats what ive been trying to tell you see friday night is the last roller disco party and then saturday night is the last dance night ever the place is scheduled to be demolished pretty soon
8408416 demolished as in condemned and dangerous is it like all decrepit but like in a cool way
8408417 nah theyre knocking it down to built some residence or something
8408418 huh no probably some mid rise luxury glass and steel bullshit a halfway house
8408419 roxys in an area thats pretty desolate and theres no subway or anything so im guessing that since its so remote they must be building some kind rehab residence or something for societys undesirables
8408420 sort of depends on your definition of undesirable anyway since its near the chelsea piers and the high line
8408421 if id let you finish id probably want to slit my wrists numb nuts ive gotta call all my buds and let them know roxys safe for us anyway sorry youre losing it but hey at least youve still got palladium that place will always be around
8408422 dr muriel howard could teach you a thing about spelling and punctuation
8408423 we dont have a lot of time to unite the democratic party
8408424 that which historically divides us cannot divide us if we want barack obama to be president of the united states
8408425 barack needs illinoisans to love each other then he needs us to leave our front row seats and go hug ohio go hug michigan go hug florida
8408426 i am not going to be satisfied until i see rod blagojevich give mike madigan a hug
8408427 i need to start working right away within two weeks or else things will start falling apart
8408428 i had only worked there three months and she wasnt able to pay me anymore
8408429 its the same every year then in one or two months we come back
8408430 i can certainly go three or four months without dipping into savings
8408431 if i cant find anything i am going to go into business for myself
8408432 i love the structure of a working environment and i like the feeling of accomplishment i grew up on a farm and all ive known is work
8408433 they dont ask how old you are but they see that you worked somewhere 37 years and they can do the math
8408434 i felt that with a masters degree i should get paid more than 30 000
8408435 and if that doesnt work out id just probably go back to school and get a certificate to be a teacher
8408436 they had one product recalled and another didnt get approved
8408437 i need to find which ones are really right for me
8408438 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8408439 del martin and phyllis lyon defined love devotion and constancy
8408440 for all of dels life she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant her last act of public activism was her most personal marrying the love of her life after 55 years in the wake of losing her we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same sex couples thereby providing the dignity and respect that del and phyllis love deserved
8408441 the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community has lost one of its bravest and most admired activists
8408442 del martin dared for decades to fight to marry her beloved phyllis and by doing so became an iconic hero the lgbt community her death is a great loss to all of us but her life is an inspiration
8408443 del lived her life with great compassion wit tenacity generosity and valor
8408444 she inspired thousands of us to be more courageous and energetic than we thought possible when faced with moments of fatigue laziness or weakness one had only to ask what would del and phyllis do while she will be greatly missed her legacy will be cherished forever

8408453 you know i get asked about it and i always say nobody asked me how old i was when i was walking the streets of baghdad that tends to solve that problem
8408454 i think people want a commissioner who respects them and works for them
8408455 i think thats devastating for us we need smart planned commercial growth to develop more county revenue to offset the deficit weve seen as a result of the residential growth over the past few years

8408457 maliciously assault beat strike and batter plaintiff her face and head with great force and violence causing severe and permanent disfigurement to her face
8408458 endangering her unborn child and permanently disfiguring her face when police investigators arrived mr northcutt intentionally withheld the identity of the culprit his conduct is deplorable
8408459 you can anticipate that our cemetery to be up to par with other national cemeteries including arlington we really consider our cemeteries not just a final resting place for veterans but national shrines
8408460 no one else knows how hard this is for me
8408461 is the owner of a swimming pool insulated from liability per se for a lifeguards negligence simply because the lifeguard is required to be there surely not
8408462 there would still be issues of negligence in hiring or supervision and of control the exact issues disputed here
8408463 these are our children this is our responsibility and i think thats the message i brought and the community has embraced it
8408464 we have to realize that not all parents are ready to do algebra with their children but all parents are valuable and they are the key
8408465 indomitable spirit both on and off the screen his effortless embodiment of the american masculine ideal and the way sucking up to him will facilitate future access to his impossibly fertile and glamorous life partner angelina jolie
8408466 a tightly wound slickly plotted spy comedy that couldnt be in bigger contrast
8408467 pitt in fact gets the best of the funny stuff though has by some way the least screen time of all the principal cast
8408468 dark goofball comedy about assorted doofuses in washington d c
8408469 tries to mate sex farce with a satire of a paranoid political thriller
8408470 savagely comic taste for creative violence and a slightly mocking eye for detail
8408471 what we are expecting is a hate crimes bill an employment non discrimination act and a lifting of the dont ask dont tell policy
8408472 it is a measure of our power that we dont speculate that we have that common understanding and that its universally understood
8408473 i suspect and hope that the sophistication and power of the community has changed and that we wont get into a situation like we did in 1993
8408474 i grouped with you last week and thought you were an awesome would you like to group up again for another heroic

8408478 our defense is what pushes this team whats always going to determine how successful we are
8408479 when we decided to start locking down on defense thats what happened we didnt do that in the third quarter
8408480 we do not have a working majority but if we get to 60 votes we can move bills to the floor of the senate
8408481 its a myth that hes anything different than a rubber stamp for george bush in washington
8408482 hyper partisan politician who seeks to deepen the divide between the states urban and rural areas
8408483 for 12 years in the senate gordon smith has not been afraid to cross his party when he thinks theyre wrong
8408484 jeff merkley and the national democratic party are throwing grenades at that bipartisan bill
8408485 its slimy and sad for jeff merkley to justify reckless spending by standing behind a citizen theres nothing weaker than jeff merkley passing the buck
8408486 if youre well known like smith and voters are lukewarm or not sure if they want to retain you thats not good news
8408487 margo is a veteran who brings experience and solid defensive presence to our frontcourt

8408493 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8408494 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand

8408504 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8408505 believed that it was clear that the reference in the ad to all parts of the internet referred to internet site availability not to every aspect of functionality available on every web site they said the decision not to enable some proprietary software would not affect the ability of the iphone user to access any part of the internet only their ability to access particular content that used third party technology
8408506 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered that the claims implied users would be able to access all web sites and see them in their entirety we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a web site normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the web site we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8408507 im not sure whats more incredible that the asa thought the ad was misleading even my firefox browser cant access all of the internet or that it took just two complaints to see the ad banned dont like the tv ad your competitor is running in the u k send in a complaint and have your grandmother do the same youll never have to worry about it again
8408508 apple has been in the content business since it launched the itunes store in 2003 when it began selling music via itunes
8408509 but the music and movies it sells and rents are pretty much pre vetted by middlemen before they get to apple the app store is a different story apple employees are now assessing dozens of applications a day which means theyre going to be asked to constantly make subjective decisions about whether something is too violent or too sexual for iphone toting youth or anyone else
8408510 apple finds itself on both sides in battle of the bans
8408511 the department of strained acronyms i like it synapse not so much so heres a more

8408515 having the ability to cost effectively develop innovative ideas is vital
8408516 if you wonder why the province of alberta is investing more than the federal government i would just ask you to look at the size of each of our surpluses then youll know why im using the bic pen and he horner is using the fancy silver pen
8408517 you put the water sample in a keypad put it in the device and press the button and it will instantly tell you whether theres bacteria present and whether the water is safe to drink
8408518 that would save the 24 hour culturing process thats necessary right now to detect bacteria
8408519 you avoid the necessity of a crew having to go out in a bucket truck getting up onto their ladder and pulling out a light bulb every three or four years which typically costs anywhere from 800 to 1 000 each time
8408520 what weve been able to do is do that with a non contact wireless technology that adds tremendous efficiencies and lower cost
8408521 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8408522 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8408523 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8408524 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8408525 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8408526 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8408527 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow

8408533 because hes younger and represents change people are involved for the first time
8408534 the few things that i have learned it sounds like hes said some things that may be offensive and that makes me a little hesitant as to why he chose him as his vp
8408535 im behind obama so by default i guess im behind biden too
8408536 i was a college freshman that campaigned for kerry by handing out yard signs for a total of about 20 minutes
8408537 he came from a single parent home was raised partly by his grandparents and has become a leader
8408538 he is a symbol of the break from the bush dynasty and silver spoon politics its empowering
8408539 obama has really managed to reach out to the right mediums for example the text message for the vp choice
8408540 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8408541 there s a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8408542 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita
8408543 anticipate at least an 80 per cent shut in of the energy production region for environmental and safety purposes
8408544 we re getting some pretty powerful data that suggests slower growth and higher gasoline prices have really crimped oil demand in the u s
8408545 i was arrested and it was basically because i was standing up for someone speaking out on something i thought was wrong and what happens when you speak out you go to jail
8408546 this movie i just did i was forced to study the other side that was the greatest education i could have got in humanity what we liberals think of as anathema it became a people thing the obstacles are greed fear pretty basic stuff

8408548 all of us owe george soros a great deal of gratitude
8408549 he thinks the ballot question is a responsible initiative to reduce the overreliance on criminal justice sanctions in dealing with marijuana
8408550 marijuana should not be a priority of the criminal justice system
8408551 decriminalizing marijuana is a slippery slope and sends the wrong message
8408552 compounding this is the fact that users of marijuana are 10 times more likely to be injured or injure others in automobile crashes
8408553 they can move on and get a student loan and get their first apartment and move on with their lives
8408554 people recognize that there are a lot better things we could be doing with our police resources
8408555 i am so surprised to hear that question that is honestly the first time i have been asked that
8408556 oh whats two to three more days on a project that weve worked two to three years on
8408557 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now

8408563 quite frankly i am very disappointed greg oconnor and the association have used that sort of language the reality is that new zealand police have never had a better period than they have had under this government
8408564 it must be the rain greg oconnor you little creep
8408565 quite frankly i am very disappointed greg oconnor and the association have used that sort of language the reality is that new zealand police have never had a better period than they have had under this government
8408566 nevertheless the debate did bring to an end the long and thorough period of trialling evaluation analysis and consultation
8408567 we will now take steps to reintroduce the 32 tasers to the three auckland districts and the wellington district before that can happen the tasers will need to be retrofitted with cameras and appropriate refresher training undertaken it will therefore be several months before the tasers will make an appearance as a tactical weapon option
8408568 the story now should be what helen klark knew about the 100 000 donation and if she did know why she has kept quiet about it all this time
8408569 and that of course is if the office sfo is not disbanded first by this labour led government supported by the very man who is is now in its sights

8408599 deaths have outnumbered births in germany since 1972 and the gap between births and deaths is continuously becoming bigger

8408601 she was going to stay strong for her babies and she did
8408602 there was prayer lifted up for her all over this county in all the churches
8408603 were just excited to have her found and safe and alive
8408604 were happy with the verdict but its a shame this should have been limited to one death
8408605 he should have had the courage and the guts to kill himself before killing anyone else
8408606 this defendant is dangerous he is a predator who takes pride in his work
8408607 he earned this day his actions call out for the death penalty
8408608 by the verdict today they have given voice to the victims
8408609 i cant speak for shasta i cant get inside her head
8408610 possibly now well have to be dragged through a court proceeding in california if they go ahead with the prosecution it would be such as waste of taxpayer money because hell never spend a day in a california prison
8408611 generally for human beings its pretty hard to maintain impartiality when confronted with such horror
8408612 how could any juror not want to see this person removed from our list of living human beings how could you live with yourself as a juror if theres any chance this human being could escape from jail and do something like this again
8408613 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8408614 in all likelihood hell be back fighting the good fight from his couch by this evening
8408615 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8408616 had we not gotten there when we did this could have easily ended up tragically
8408617 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8408618 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8408619 the spraying we have done over the last two weeks appears to have significantly diminished the spread of west nile virus on the far south side especially in beverly morgan park washington heights west pullman and several other neighborhoods
8408620 this week based upon what we are currently seeing in our mosquito traps on the north and northwest sides we are taking quick and decisive action to protect the public health in the greater irving park area
8408621 spraying to kill adult mosquitoes is a sensible and effective component of an integrated pest management program this year were choosing to deploy it in those city neighborhoods most affected by west nile
8408622 while no one can control the weather and in a city of 228 square miles we cant prevent every single mosquito from hatching and biting it is our expectation that this effort by further limiting the mosquito population will prevent cases of human illness in chicago
8408623 sure wed love to but only if you support single sign on with google apps

8408634 graves were wrecked by young vandals who had no connection with the republican movement indeed two graves belonging to republicans were also desecrated
8408635 this was a pathetic attempt by dolores kelly to link the incident with legitimate opposition to the british crown forces in craigavon on tuesday night
8408636 furthermore john odowds requests for anyone with information about a sniper targeting british forces on the brownlow road to report this to the ruc is nothing less than an attempt to recruit people from the nationalist community as british spies
8408637 the people of craigavon suffered a massive british incursion into the area with many homes wrecked and people assaulted

8408647 come to kelantan we have hundreds of malays who can speak and write chinese lets have a debate between one of them and arif shah
8408648 you think permatang pauh voters are stupid that they only rely on anwars personality to vote for him that was 1998
8408649 i used to support bn mic all my life but when they started harassing anwar with the sodomy allegations the second time i gave up
8408650 moreover i pray everyday and it is not right to witness injustice and not do anything about it hurting anwars family is too much if umno just want to maintain power
8408651 come on what about the umno guys who have been doing deals for 50 years what happenned to all of them
8408652 because if you are here i do not need to read the papers anymore i dont know if they are telling the truth or not i just read the sports pages
8408653 the quality is so bad its not even good enough to be used as toilet paper
8408654 4 the more you beat anwar the more the people love him
8408655 i have received many complaints from the chinese community over the statement for the past two days
8408656 i am saddened that he could make such a statement it is a generalisation to assume that all chinese dont treat their friends well accusing the whole community like this is uncalled for
8408657 i know he was canvassing for votes during the recent by election but he didnt have to resort to using a racist statement
8408658 its insensitive to talk about other races like this we want him to retract the statement and we will demand an apology from him
8408659 we want to maintain peace and stability in the country
8408660 we are trying to contact him but until now we have not been able to do so not yet

8408664 well that would ruin the surprise of what you would write on the card

8408668 i dont always pay a whole lot of attention to whats going on in the company
8408669 the stock that was supposed to be her security turned into dust
8408670 never thought that what pat said was stupid although a lot of it was
8408671 her generosity and kindness were spontaneous and sincere but her mind did not move in a straight line any more than a cow crops grass as a lawnmower does
8408672 that company destroyed my father he lost his job his savings his pension his wife and his house all in about six months
8408673 was so fully convinced of her own worth that it was hard to forget her price tag when you were with her

8408686 our time together was beautiful but i realized that there are still things i like to discover so
8408687 it seems that we are not compatible with each other
8408688 no nation in the world takes human rights more seriously than the united states
8408689 shanghai is remarkably safe the shanghainese are still the special ones of china they still get the added respect from criminal elements from other parts of china that affords them an additional layer of protection something the folks in booming cities like shenzhen across from hong kong no longer have in shenzhen if they want your purse but you hang onto it too tightly they might just cut your arm off but even as residents here in shanghai for over 20 years the authors have not been touched by it or even really seen it sure a pick pocketed wallet and a pinched mobile both lost more from carelessness than to an exercise of someones criminal ability but real crime best to watch the late night local tv news to see that but the bad guys are coming sure enough and the young ones are in training blue collar china crime forms the most fearful element of the 4th army of instability in the end the white and red elements of the 4th army may cause more financial long term harm but it is the physical nature of the blue army that paralyzes most people with fear
8408690 china a country that often professes its modesty its calmness has its own demons to slay rapidly following the path of developed countries chinas list of serial and mass killers grows ominously
8408691 digo que somos esclavos de la camiseta nacional porque trabajamos y nadie nos da el m rito que merecemos cuando tienes los reales eres el rey si no los tienes eres el fracaso creo que es el momento de decirlo
8408692 ya es hora de que nos pidan opini n de c mo pueden comenzar a funcionar las cosas porque nosotros trabajamos pero ellos dirigen y dicen lo qu tenemos que hacer
8408693 se piensa que porque hay un comedor y una mesa es suficiente pero no toman en cuenta que se deben hacer m s sacrificios para representar al pa s y no se vislumbra nada a largo plazo por eso ven que uno siempre est pidiendo
8408694 es un tema bien delicado hubo parte de la poblaci n que apost en contra de los atletas por el eslogan auque sea el gobierno el que no est financiando
8408695 es f cil decir que una ley va a mejorar las cosas claro normalizar algunas pero en el deporte todo se mejora con participaci n
8408696 cada cuatro a os se arma esta alharaca no hay un seguimiento una motivaci n para atacar los problemas son cosas repetitivas y debemos sincerarnos
8408697 claro que me hubiese gustado que ganaran una pero con todo el respeto que merece el presidente no comparto su criterio hay que competir pero debe haber una compensaci n por el esfuerzo
8408698 creo que el presidente quiso hacer algo dentro de todas las motivaciones que tiene pero sabe que desde el punto de vista t cnico es imposible que una empresa que no tiene nada que ver con el deporte pueda manejar la parte de alta competencia
8408699 provocadora confiscadora y que afecta la paz y tranquilidad del pa s
8408700 uno se pregunta si es que como el gobierno siente que en algunas regiones del pa s producto de lo que ha ocurrido hay gobernadores que no van a poder ganar las elecciones entonces subvirtiendo el orden propone estas leyes
8408701 la que se aprob en la habilitante se ala que si el gobierno decide que un bien o servicio es de utilidad p blica lo confisca y listo
8408702 les est n confiscando las cosas que como derecho el pa s los venezolanos y los sectores m s d biles han conquistado y que se concretaron en la constituci n del 99

8408706 young jeezy live at the blender theatre sound of the city village voice
8408707 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8408708 we are however disappointed that pedro would allow his agent to pursue this claim on his behalf pedro showed tremendous fortitude and independent thinking when he agreed to his contract on aug 15
8408709 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8408710 it is the unions obligation on behalf of all players to defend the integrity of its collectively bargained agreements
8408711 mr boras is apparently satisfied with the 6 million bonus that he secured for mr hosmer and has not challenged the validity of that contract
8408712 mr boras has been informed that if he pursues a claim that our contract with pedro was not timely he puts eric hosmers contract with kansas city in jeopardy
8408713 the deadline was extended to accept minor league contracts voluntarily entered into by the clubs and the players with the help of their agents
8408714 it is settled law that the arbitration panel has no authority to disturb such minor league contracts
8408715 we agreed in the appropriate time frame and the terms were submitted in a timely matter
8408716 eric hosmer is completely satisfied with the terms of his contract and is completely satisfied with being part of this organization
8408717 we continue to believe that in pedro alvarez the person and the baseball player and remain excited to add pedro to our system
8408718 we will sit down with pedro as soon as mr boras claim is rejected to chart a new and more productive start to pedros career with the pittsburgh pirates
8408719 its pretty impressive really you dont ever see this that much in motorsports
8408720 hes winning by quite a bigger margin than carmichael did thats the most impressive thing were trying to get close to him but hes still beating us by 30 to 40 seconds pretty consistently ricky had done it but on a few occasions he barely won motos
8408721 when i first went into the season i was just trying to stay healthy
8408722 i was like well lets just try to do the first race
8408723 the seasons been great my outlook coming in you never expect to go this good its been a lot of laps a lot of holeshots a lot of stuff thats been going my way and to do something like this you need a lot of luck
8408724 i knew there was no way i could finish the whole season like that it was just a matter of time before id tear something else
8408725 obviously everyone at the top works really hard with conditioning and stuff definitely the bike is pretty good since were one and two in points but hes just a gifted rider
8408726 when i was off for those four months i really had a newfound fun ness in the sport
8408727 football players hear training camp and think aww its here again
8408728 i dont want to take anything for granted i just want to have fun i know if im in shape and having fun ill be unbeatable
8408729 my hat goes off to my crew for getting me back out there at that point it was about getting whatever you could get and we were fortunate to get back to ninth
8408730 i think weve had the mindset to keep it going
8408731 everywhere we show up were pretty competitive we dont think there is a track where we dont think we have a chance of winning
8408732 learned helplessness a psychological condition caused by prolonged exposure to unpredictable events
8408733 we have been exposed to an alarming sequence of market disasters
8408734 all of these came to us in quick succession and in direct contradiction to the prevalent advice given by financial advisors and the media
8408735 a new paradigm in housing in which prices will continue to rise indefinitely
8408736 as long as the music in terms of liquidity is playing youve got to get up and dance were still dancing
8408737 all signs i look at show the us housing market is at or near a bottom
8408738 the subprime implosion is a contained isolated and temporary event with little risk of wider fallout
8408739 what screams bubble giant historic bubble in real estate is the system wide extension of massive amounts of credit to finance property purchases when prices begin to fall lenders will experience a rising number of defaults on the mortgages they hold
8408740 low liquidity levels dangerous exposure to leveraged derivatives the inflated value of the property that borrowers have put up as collateral on loans and the substantial size of the mortgages that their clients hold compared both to those property values and to the clients potential inability to pay under adverse circumstances
8408741 theres no mistaking it now is the most dangerous time to get on board the housing bandwagon
8408742 banks seem to be blind to the danger of overpriced collateral as they continue to stuff their balance sheets with mortgage backed assets lenders are still behind the curve but once they see the writing on the wall the rug will get pulled out from under the economy in a hurry
8408743 its nice to give andy murray some company in these events and share the limelight with him im in the third round of a grand slam for the first time but i dont want to stop now
8408744 breaking into the top 100 three months ago was a goal that kept me going it just took me a lot longer than many players i knew that if i kept working it would happen

8408748 the sittercity corporate program offers a real solution for associates that have trouble getting to work because of responsibilities for their loved ones like after school care for their child a sick pet or elderly parents who need to get to doctor appointments

8408765 immobilizing these thin slices of time has been a source of continuing fascination for the photographer and while pursuing this experiment he discovered something else he discovered that there was pleasure and a beauty in this fragmenting of time that had little to do with what was happening it had to do rather with seeing the momentary patterning of lines and shapes that had been previously concealed within the flux of movement
8408766 for the photographer who demanded formal rigor from his pictures color was an enormous complication of a problem already cruelly difficult after a period of frustrating experimentation decided that since black and white had been good enough for david octavius hill brady and stieglitz it was good enough for them
8408767 not as a separate issue to be solved in isolation

8408773 the gulf of mexico area has a large percentage of oil production and refining
8408774 when katrina hit it knocked out 8 percent of the refining capacity for supplies of retail gas to go down by 8 percent is a huge shock to the system
8408775 over the course of three or four days that type of hike was unheard of at the time
8408776 i dont think weve seen anything like that since gas has been high this summer but it was more of a gradual increase
8408777 more often than not if crude oil prices are going up oil companies will pre emptively raise gas prices to slow demand
8408778 oil companies dont like to scare off consumers if they can ease people into price hikes consumers are less likely to change their habits
8408779 weve seen gas prices come down significantly but its still high and supplies are tight its a bad time to have a hurricane on a holiday weekend

8408781 he was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly

8408789 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 per cent of threats out there

8408797 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8408798 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one

8408821 im scared and i tell him something is in the house
8408822 so i reached for the light switch and perched on a bookshelf was this huge moth
8408823 by certainly mid september or so it may really start to taper off
8408824 we are all cups constantly and quietly being filled the trick is knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out
8408825 at some point i believe one has to stop holding back for fear of alienating some imaginary reader or real relative or friend and come out with personal truth
8408826 i come that they may have life and it to the full
8408827 sorry guys i know thatd be fun but it wouldnt be very christian
8408828 learn this i want you to show them compassion mercy not offer rituals sacrifices i came not to call those who are acting putting on a show perfect righteous but those who know they need saving sinners
8408829 number one he was hungry number two he likes everyone including scum like you
8408830 o mundo gira e o mundo transmuda mas h uma coisa que jamais se transfigura em todos os meus anos algo existe que n o muda todavia a ocultais esta coisa que perdura a eterna luta entre o bem e o mal distra dos descuidais vossas igrejas e sacr rios mostrar vos ei as coisas que se fazem agora e algumas que de h muito se fizeram a fim de que possais cobrar coragem aperfei oai vossa vontade deixai que vos revele a obra dos humildes escutai
8408831 the university of wisconsin whitewater is moving in the right direction the state of the university is strong and we are well positioned to maintain our momentum
8408832 i have been going to the chancellors address for a good many years this one was the best
8408833 what a great sport our chancellor is coming in on a scooter it set the stage for a lighter mood in the auditorium a little humor goes a long way in keeping your audience with you
8408834 i think the chancellor did an excellent job at highlighting the progress that the campus is making in terms of the strategic plan
8408835 i think that all of the campus units really are moving forward while taking slightly different paths
8408836 has definitely had conversations with microsoft about doing a new halo game and is very excited at the prospect
8408837 the essence is to lead people design is the embodiment of the right information at the right time
8408838 how do we make money is the obvious common language between business and design
8408839 it took me quite a while to understand i learned the hard way
8408840 they narrow the solutions for us and can translate between business and design articulating benefits
8408841 at this point their egos could be through the roof
8408842 but they wanted to understand who we are and work according to that
8408843 it allowed bloomberg to evolve without abandoning what made us successful
8408844 they arent afraid of the tenuous line between art and design
8408845 bezos needs to plant his feet somwehwere in this digital world and books are something amazon really understands
8408846 i have been tracking the sales of kindle editions of our books against sales of the printed versions for the past almost eight months kindle sales have declined noticeably over the past few weeks while print editions continue to sell at a steady pace i am beginning to think that amazon has hit a marketing wall due to a combination of factors
8408847 you read 1 000 pages of books on your iphone while i read the same 1 000 pages on the kindle well see who can complete this faster as i guarantee your eyes will hurt looking at that small backlit screen
8408848 kindle fails to set light to unsold e book pile
8408849 kindle supports wireless delivery of unprotected microsoft word html txt jpeg gif png bmp prc and mobi files
8408850 it sure is much welcome rain i hope we can keep getting some along
8408851 hopefully we will have our reservoir at full pond by the end of the week
8408852 theyve all been quite good really and the men were all more less very nice i suppose in relation at least no one ever beat me up
8408853 i bursted out laughing in the middle of the sentence as i realized what i was saying it was not intentional he wasnt smiling but u have to be ready to take some shit for what uve done i think he knew that
8408854 they wanted to be able to hear some answers as to what had happened
8408855 because of their christian beliefs and their willingness to try to look at the whole situation because of those beliefs they tried to be forgiving i think that was the turning point that caused them to be in agreement for the pleas
8408856 my client hes been devastated by the accident psychologically and emotionally
8408857 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8408858 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aide using battleships
8408859 any attempts to jeopardise this atmosphere of cooperation would not only have a negative impact for russia but will definitely harm the economic interests of those states
8408860 weber sees no need for the european central bank to lower interest rates any time soon and said the ecb should consider raising interest rates when the european economy strengthens toward the end of this year
8408861 adds to the still nascent optimism that the us economy may be turning the corner
8408862 even so it is still too early to sound the all clear and activity and sentiment indicators remain vulnerable to any deterioration in the news flow surrounding the ongoing credit crisis banking sector problems and housing market woes
8408863 amid speculation that the nations housing slump could force the central bank to lower interest rates to curtail the slowdown
8408864 president clinton will lay out the choices that we face on foreign policy
8408865 he will talk about how barack obama has what it takes to be a strong commander in chief
8408866 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8408867 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8408868 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8408869 while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8408870 if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8408871 they dont pose a serious threat to us the way the soviet union posed a threat to us
8408872 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8408873 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8408874 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8408875 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8408876 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8408877 25 000 marines in the province are probably being in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8408878 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8408879 your success in beijing has brought a big honour not only to kenya but the whole of africa
8408880 the hijackers surrendered without any violence and the crew are safe and sound
8408881 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8408882 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8408883 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8408884 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8408885 i was pushed to the limit the last time i played her she was up 5 1 in third and i had to come back
8408886 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
8408887 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
8408888 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
8408889 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
8408890 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
8408891 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
8408892 the photo identification cards issued by indianas bmv are also free
8408893 the alternative is to provide free id cards but that would surely cause our already high taxes to increase
8408894 a carbon tax would increase the price of gasoline at the pump
8408895 i think wed be fooling ourselves if however we deal with the issue of climate change that in the end theres not going to be some cost to canadians and theres not going to be some element of economic dislocation
8408896 i think thats inevitable in dealing with an issue thats as problematic and challenging as climate change
8408897 no doubt under mr harpers plan you can speak to anyone in the industry about the regulations not only are they confusing to industry but they will mean new costs and they too will pass those prices on
8408898 how do you get to those caps you have to make investments to get to those caps and that investment ultimately has to be passed through
8408899 a carbon tax at an uncertain time like this is an irresponsible thing to do to consumers because it will drive the price of gasoline up
8408900 i can say generically that the medical examiners decision is based on a medical point of view and not from a legal point of view
8408901 at this point im not in a position to comment
8408902 but the medical examiner doesnt necessarily know all the facts hes just giving an opinion about the immediate cause of death and not the legal cause
8408903 without knowing the case facts you can just speculate on a million different possibilities
8408904 they felt there was criminal misconduct and thats what they felt was the appropriate charge
8408905 all i can say is that he drowned i dont know how it happened that he drowned
8408906 he hasnt come in expecting anything just because of what he did in high school
8408907 hes shown me and the rest of the guys that hes gonna earn his position earn his spot and so far hes done that every day
8408908 hes real laid back hes cool on and off the field we hang out all the time this past weekend we just kicked it together hes a humble guy
8408909 hes a great athlete a great guy both on and off the field
8408910 some people have got it some people dont hes one who has it
8408911 hes consistently made plays in practice and in both scrimmages
8408912 after the first scrimmage it was pretty evident that he was going to have some role as one of the three receivers that we use quite a bit
8408913 this last week he certainly solidified his position as the starter he and mike mccoy have been our two best receivers throughout this camp
8408914 they thought he was going to be but hes a hard worker
8408915 hes not out boasting about what hes going to do he just lets his actions speak louder than his words
8408916 were still receiving tips that some of the other fugitives at least one or two of the other fugitives could be in
8408917 then welcome home this is your place and were glad to have you
8408918 his great society legislation made it possible for children of color and of humble origins like senator obama to fulfill their dreams dreams to get the best education dreams for the chance to vote and be voted for
8408919 at the convention the democrats try to reward the states that vote democrat if a state has a democratic governor they get bonus points or bonus delegates if the state went to say john kerry in the last election they get bonus points
8408920 generally they are pledged to vote for the person who won the most votes in that caucus or primary
8408921 they go to the convention uncommitted they can say when they get there theyre going to vote this way but they are really uncommitted this gives some power to the establishment so that if you had a convention they thought was going the wrong way they could rein it back by casting their votes
8408922 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
8408923 the wests foreign policy priority is no longer terrorism it is to tame the new great power nationalisms and harness them to democratic ideals
8408924 to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order a world where the rule of law not the rule of the jungle governs the conduct of nations
8408925 the wests foreign policy priority is no longer terrorism it is to tame the new great power nationalisms and harness them to democratic ideals
8408926 you know the best part of killing someone the look on their face its that look not when theyre threatened not when you hurt them not even when they see the knife its when they feel the knife go in thats it its surprise they just cant believe its really happening to them she had that look the girl when she knew it wasnt just porno
8408927 hey thats odd pnac says race specific bioweapons may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a re the most important news link ever
8408928 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
8408929 f that bourbon syrup on those amazing sweet potato pancakes i cant get over it

8408942 blow up 2 makes even clearer enlargements now but the biggest improvements are in ease of use
8408943 we looked for tedious or confusing aspects of every stage of photo cropping and resizing and built intelligence into blow up 2 to take those hassles out of the photographers hair with the addition of presets smart cropping adaptive sharpening and built in batch processing blow up 2 takes the pain out of high quality photo resizing
8408944 eat and drink whatever you want wherever you want because nobody actually cares or is checking
8408945 dont worry with the newer and advance technologies my hair will come out very nicely curled without causing any damage to my hair
8408946 you can pretty much read any of these reviews to get a good impression of dinner at zenkichi
8408947 hi how long is the wait time for two people
8408948 do you take names down on a list so we can get a table when one opens up can we leave a mobile number for the wait list
8408949 what kind of fruit of this its hard to place
8408950 it could be rubharb i think we had rubhard a few days ago so it could be
8408951 okay were fancy and slightly expensive were located in the overly hip and therefore not that hip flatiron district so we have to give them flair at the same time we know that one of the best things about spanish food is how simple it is so lets try to combine flair with simplicity that way we wont alienate anyone
8408952 how about a little less attitude and a little more action
8408953 awe poor baby its not the way you like it
8408954 of course its not the way you like it the way you like it didnt last 100 years as this steak house has so shut up and stick the meat in your mouth
8408955 fue buena la actitud que hubo en la primera parte
8408956 estamos amargados por el resultado pero tenemos que levantarnos en el pr ximo partido
8408957 si bien hay mucha amargura tenemos que rescatar lo positivo y trabajar en lo an mico para levantar esto
8408958 sufrimos un segundo tiempo at pico porque ese gol tempranero el que marc h ctor cuevas desvirtu el partido ya que quisimos salir a buscar y ellos de mitad de cancha para adelante tienen un equipo que si le dejas espacios te liquida
8408959 fue buena la actitud que hubo en la primera parte
8408960 ir a buscar el empate con un hombre menos por la expulsi n de friedrich es arriesgado contra este tipo de rival que cuenta con tan buenos jugadores
8408961 equivocamos el camino para buscar el gol tendr amos que haber esperado defendernos m s y esperar alguna pelota parada para obtener el empate pero la desesperaci n de querer salir a buscar el partido nos jug en contra
8408962 ya van a llegar los goles este es un equipo que se levant de varias situaciones adversas y esta no es la excepci n pero eso no quiere decir que no poder anotar sea la causa de las derrotas que sufrimos
8408963 por cosas como estas el equipo no puede quedarse con los tres puntos
8408964 hay perros que se llaman tlalchichi bajuelos y redondillos que son muy buenos de comer los topos de esta tierra son grandes como grandes ratas este animal es de comer y sabroso y muy gordo
8408965 en el comer le ten an sus cocineros sobre treinta maneras de guisados hechos a su manera y usanza y ten anlos puestos en braseros de barro chicos debajo porque no se enfriasen cotidianamente le guisaban gallinas gallos de papada faisanes perdices de la tierra codornices patos mansos y bravos venado puerco de la tierra jabal pajaritos de ca a y de palomas y liebres y conejos y muchas maneras de aves y cosas que se cr an en esta tierra que son tantas que no las acabar de nombrar tan presto dos mujeres le tra an tortillas tra anle frutas de todas cuantas hab a tra an en unas como a manera de copas de oro fino cierta bebida hecha de cacao dec an que era para tener acceso con mujeres
8408966 el mantenimiento principal de los mayas es el ma z del cual hacen diversos manjares y bebidas y a n bebido como lo beben les sirve de comida y bebida que hacen de ma z y cacao molido una manera de espuma muy sabrosa con que celebran sus fiestas y que sacan del cacao una grasa que parece mantequilla que hacen guisados de legumbres y carne de venado y aves monteses y dom sticas que hay muchas y de pescados que hay muchas y de pescados que hay muchos y que as tiene buenos mantenimientos

8408980 i would consider this to be at the fact finding stage
8408981 if human civilization is going to invade the waters of the earth then
8408982 we have 28 scientists from seven countries and five years worth of funding
8408983 the end permian catastrophe is an extreme version of the consequences of global warming said lee kump a geoscientist at the pennsylvania state university
8408984 it reminds us that there are unexpected consequences of co2 buildup and these can be quite dire indeed
8408985 in the late permian earth itself was the villain but today weve stepped in as the villain
8408986 theres less than one percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than four of five percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with

8408990 the medieval debate over the subject matter of metaphysics stems from various proposals in

8408992 people ask me about the meaning of life what is the meaning of this or that what is the meaning of the tree the meaning of the tree is that it is there meaning is a thing of the mind we dont really want meaning what we really want deep down is an experience of being fully truly alive
8408993 boomerang my head back to the city i grew up in again and again

8408997 its great news for more than one reason what he brings to the ice everyone knows joe is joe but what he brings to the locker room the respect everybodys so calm when hes around thats what he brings that people dont see
8408998 teams asked if they could at least submit an offer for consideration and joe told me to advise teams not to bother

8409006 this psychiatry s t apparently what youre feeling is not what youre feeling and what youre not feeling is your real agenda
8409007 these people are not like pro fans this is their school its their pride and joy it aint like dolphin stadium i can tell you that
8409008 it takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition
8409009 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
8409010 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
8409011 dada a aleatoriedade da distribui o do princ pio activo a dificuldade de quantificar a dose enorme
8409012 as for the soundtrack i had music streaming from my pc while playing through saints row not a big fan of most of the music they put into these games

8409016 o jogador come ou a gritar da quadra para que simplesmente parassem de tocar
8409017 temos que estar treinando com os melhores para pegar experi ncia
8409018 a pista de canoagem era muito boa uma das mais dif ceis do mundo estava feliz em estar entre as melhores atletas do mundo
8409019 mike came in and handled volunteers and we won the election
8409020 so i told mike to go to wyoming and run things there
8409021 the only way that we now can support the things that hillary supported is to get behind obama i worry about this country if we cant get that sorted out
8409022 obama showed what he was made of this is the single most unambiguous step that a presidential candidate can make
8409023 fiquei surpreso quando n o recebi o colete de titular no treino de s bado no meu contrato n o diz que devo ser titular e nunca questionei isso em nenhum clube que passei mas fui procurar saber do treinador quais eram seus planos para mim nesta temporada
8409024 estou lutando para ser convocado novamente para a sele o brasileira e para isso preciso estar jogando em alto n vel participei de toda a pr temporada na equipe principal e n o entendi quando me vi fora da rela o dos jogadores que come ariam a partida contra a inter de mil o como j estava de cabe a quente por problemas familiares tomei esta atitude impensada
8409025 we believe we are strongly placed to deliver this much needed infrastructure
8409026 we estimate that to build a significant fibre optic network covering the auckland region would cost more than 1 billion
8409027 this is clearly a significant investment and one that could take shape in a number of different ways depending on the nature and structure of broadband investment funds proposed this option will remain a key area of focus for us
8409028 we understand those assets and we are assessing our options in that space
8409029 i think its also important to note that we have a share buyback in place and that provides a valuable investment option for us
8409030 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8409031 ante todo quiero felicitar al atl tico por su victoria de hoy ha sido una victoria merecida y el resultado ha sido muy claro
8409032 en la segunda mitad tuvimos posibilidades despu s del 2 0 tuvimos oportunidades pero ni hicimos gol y esa ha sido la diferencia y la clave del partido
8409033 no me ha gustado el resultado estoy decepcionado y a pesar de que el equipo haya avanzado en su juego no tengo motivos para estar contento
8409034 el atl tico es un gran equipo y est en disposici n de no recibir goles y de hacerlos porque tiene grandes delanteros
8409035 ha sido dura esta derrota tanto para nuestros seguidores como para el equipo va a ser dif cil superar este rev s eso est claro porque tenemos ahora dos d as para preparar el siguiente partido y superar esta adversidad
8409036 no puedo echar la culpa a los jugadores hemos jugado de forma ofensiva a partir del segundo gol y eso implica dejar m s espacios algo que el atl tico pudo aprovechar
8409037 los equipos espa oles tienen gran calidad t cnica y pueden jugar muy bien al f tbol pero no creo que hoy la diferencia haya sido tan grande la diferencia ha estado en la efectividad a la hora de marcar goles
8409038 emi you can do it i have faith in you

8409082 most of the contributors come from universities or law firms who want to raise their profile
8409083 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable
8409084 we are building a critical mass of users and contributors around the world and we hope the service will continue to track the rapid change in online law

8409137 playing political hardball using tabor drive in a suit without merit against the marcus law firm in a vindictive and malicious fashion to begin with no one knows what will occur in the appellate process and the marcus law firm continues to believe that the town of branford will succeed on appeal
8409138 the payment of additional attorneys fees in order to seek reversal of the jury verdict payment of costs for attorneys for appeals and attorneys fees for attempting to disclose experts past the deadline and moving for re argument

8409144 rejected the proffered expert testimony because the court considered it irrelevant
8409145 as a fiduciary because of the attorney client relationship defendants doyle and the marcus law firm had a superior knowledge and skill in the management of the litigation and owed to the town a high degree of good faith and undivided loyalty the town relied upon the defendant for advice and counsel in the litigation
8409146 the legal services they provided deviated from the standard of care of a reasonable competent legal professional engaged in the provision of civil lawsuit defense services in the state of connecticut

8409180 barack obama fought against the born alive infants protection act which would have provided basic medical care to any infants that survive an abortion attempt he wants to kill those infants born alive
8409181 question does evil exist and if so do be ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
8409182 question abortion at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
8409183 not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia there may be legitimate diversity of opinion even among catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty but not with regard to abortion and euthanasia
8409184 under church law someone who knowingly does or backs something which the church considers a grave sin such as abortion inflicts what is known as
8409185 doubts about the value of life and the beauty of life and even a doubt about the future
8409186 selfishness and fear are at the root of pro abortion legislation
8409187 we in the church have a great struggle to defend life life is a gift not a threat
8409188 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8409189 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8409190 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8409191 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8409192 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8409193 the catechism of the catholic church is clear the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago the catechism reads
8409194 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8409195 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8409196 pelosi supports the legality of abortion she voted against the
8409197 for the benefit of madam pelosi and the democratic party church writings specifically naming abortion as murder appear as early as 70 ad in the didache the first written catechism of the christian church and in spite of the attempts of various writers and groups and even some church authorities and a few popes to the contrary the history of the position of the catholic church that abortion is murder and that it is evil dates back as early as the didache and remains the same to this day
8409198 the catholic catechism is extremely clear on the nature of its position on human life and has been remarkably consistent on this point for almost 2 000 years and it finds that position in the old testament human life begins at conception not at birth and not at some point consistent with
8409199 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8409200 contrary to what pelosi says receiving communion and being a politician supporting abortion is not a
8409201 like pelosi i would like to know why nancy pelosi is still allowed to receive communion after catholic politicians they risked excommunication from the church and
8409202 theres a newly uncovered paper trail demonstrating barack obamas abortion militancy you can believe in hat tip
8409203 lawful abortion is state sanctioned infanticide it is the murder of innocent defenseless human life
8409204 so if abortion is a test case of sen obamas ability to find common ground how did he do
8409205 he might also want americans to ignore his full throated support for abortion when he appeared at a planned parenthood event last year he made it clear that he opposes any and all restrictions on abortion including partial birth abortions as david freddoso writes in his superb new

8409238 of course this raises a conceptual issue do a shows closing credits take place outside the world of the show if so and it aint hard to make that argument then who cares if the credits are set in a shitty font well then why are opening credits usually so carefully art directed they usually dont exist within the world of the show either its partly because an effective opening credits sequence helps set a tone and a style so why not sustain the tone and the style all the way to the end of the closing credits

8409495 most of us think about education in terms of what it will do for us loren swartzendruber said
8409496 what we will learn that will be useful for our future what we can achieve a particular goal that becomes more concrete
8409497 at emu we frequently talk about the educational enterprise as grounded in the liberal arts the idea that an educated person is liberated from the confines of ignorance free to explore beauty and pursue intellectual challenges its our conviction that an education in the liberal arts is the best foundation for a lifetime of learning all of these are valid reasons for being at emu
8409498 this morning i offer yet another reason for being at emu
8409499 noted theologian dr nicholas wolterstorff calls it educating for shalom its a biblical concept that is often translated peace but its more comprehensive than one english word can embody
8409500 wolterstorff suggests at least four dimensions to shalom right relationship to god to fellow human beings to nature and to oneself
8409501 to these he adds yet another facet shalom is best experienced in community and it is characterized by delight
8409502 to live in shalom is to find delight in living rightly before god in ones physical surroundings with ones fellow human beings to find delight even in living rightly with oneself
8409503 matt embodied each of wolterstorffs definition of shalom he was comfortable with himself as a person with his gifts and his place in his family and congregation
8409504 he was a confident young man knowing that he had a variety of gifts but seemingly without arrogance he was clear about the importance of faith in his life and about his relationship to god
8409505 matt wanted to serve in a physical way to serve as a nurse to bring healing and hope to the world through his work and matt had a unique capacity to make others feel they were his best friend he was other oriented delight is a good word to describe matts approach to all of life
8409506 the initial splash is small we may feel insignificant but the impact of our lives grows in concentric circles changing the world around us even beyond what we can eventually see

8409519 apple is not living up to some ideal of technology perfection
8409520 isn t any more likely to create technically perfect products than its competitors
8409521 look at all these great buttons that do these great things
8409522 it s an open secret that the highly touted macbook pro and leopard os will not reliably connect to wifi networks when using anything other than an apple brand airport wireless access point and even then some problems remain there have been 100s of complaints on the apple forums

8409526 were it not for apple constantly pushing the envelope we would all still be sitting in front of black screens with either green or amber text on them
8409527 about 80 of the time when people are on the web theyre browsing to sites theyve visited before

8409529 you talk about that as a dead end silo while selling end to end business processes
8409530 i dont think it will lead to an increase in demand for siebel
8409531 i expect this is a strategy by oracle to keep its siebel customers from looking outside of the barn

8409555 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8409556 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8409557 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank an economy out of the doldrums and trying to help middle class families and it wouldnt make much sense for me to want to edit his remarks to prevent him from making a strong case about why we need fundamental economic change in this country
8409558 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8409559 there was some tension there it was a long battle and thats what politics is about
8409560 its a little bit like relationships you fight and you reconcile
8409561 you could argue that no one is ready to be president
8409562 sen clinton has pledged her whole support to my campaign as has president clinton
8409563 i think you will see during the course of this week that the democrat party is energized and determined to take the white house back
8409564 hell not only transform the nation hes going to transform the world
8409565 and im glad to be on the trip with him
8409566 we cant afford four more years of a foreign policy that has shredded our alliances and sacrifices our moral standing around the world
8409567 ladies and gentlemen thats the bad news but there is good news america we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain

8409599 to this day people ask me about the cockroach it was disgusting
8409600 i have a fear of bugs and i had to disinfect my mouth with 100 proof vodka and just spit the bug out it makes me sick thinking about it and in the theatre it was the same reaction oh no i know the reason it is still in video stores is partly because of that
8409601 no one ever says they want to be a junky when the grow up
8409602 in our medical department alone weve gone from 24 000 annual visits to almost 40 000 visits
8409603 were pretty much supposed to provide care to anyone who walks in the door regardless of financial status insurance status or the ability to pay
8409604 that much of our increase in driving stems from trips to the mall
8409605 the way we drive is responsible for a good part of our traffic problems
8409606 where the road and the sky collide america through the eyes of its drivers
8409607 this is exactly what i thought kasinas offices would look like
8409608 all we sell is a process so it better be good
8409609 la impunidad trae el riesgo de que todo se repita
8409610 i figured once i cleared waivers and there wasnt really any action that id finish out the season in atlanta
8409611 but this obviously is exciting to come to a club thats in the playoff race and especially one like boston that has the history of a great tradition
8409612 unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that as well
8409613 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8409614 i know that ive gotten messages from people all over the league that said hes everybodys all time favorite i know hes a real professional i know hes excited about coming here
8409615 he said hell do anything we ask to try to help us win
8409616 he adds a lot to our club hes a plus defensively in center and in right he plays first base he has great instincts hes really a gamer hes the type you want up in a big spot hell help this club on the field and in the clubhouse
8409617 id have to say its my weirdest night as a professional in the big leagues
8409618 so we had a lot of background on him he has a lot of upside thats what you strive for in a trade like this
8409619 hes going to be a great addition hes one of those leader type guys
8409620 just day to day were going to keep checking be smart with it
8409621 were not talking about the end of a season were talking about the end of a career when youre dealing with a pitchers arm
8409622 were just dealing with it the best way we can i dont think we can do anything different
8409623 even though hes scheduled to pitch friday we are evaluating on a day to day basis
8409624 the key is not to let guys play when theyre in a vulnerable state
8409625 the goal is to create cells that are missing or defective in people its very exciting
8409626 this is a win win situation for medicine and ethics
8409627 but these things always look easier on the blackboard than when you have to do them in actual patients
8409628 the devil is here boy the devil himself the demon couldnt do what the devil sent him to do so the devil came himself
8409629 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
8409630 this is novel and interesting rob holy cow you must have put a ton of work into this
8409631 i really like a lot of these quotes n you one person trial thanks for bringing them back
8409632 mary i think your candidate would have a ton of political capital to spend around the world if hes the guy who delivers the inaugural address i hope he makes up his mind to spend a lot of it to good effect
8409633 i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8409634 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8409635 for every american who is trying to do the right thing
8409636 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8409637 john mccain is my friend weve known each other for three decades
8409638 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8409639 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8409640 remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as president theyll look to us again
8409641 last night hillary rodham clinton told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8409642 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8409643 in 2004 we came so close to victory we are even closer now and let me tell you this time were going to win
8409644 still embraces the extreme philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress
8409645 then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8409646 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last years back to unity and hope
8409647 just like the past just like george bush and this country cant afford a third bush term
8409648 when we choose a commander in chief this november we are electing judgment and character not years in the senate or years on this earth
8409649 time and again barack obama has seen farther thought harder and listened better and time and again barack obama has been proven right
8409650 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place unfair burden on the heroes of our armed forces
8409651 john mccain asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8409652 the grim reality is that eight years of ineffective leadership in the white house has compromised our security and made america more vulnerable
8409653 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country
8409654 lets declare with one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8409655 youve come here from so many different places having made this journey and feeling in your heart what is right for you to do
8409656 i dont think she mentioned state i want everyone to know that was her thing i do believe that if you love someone you should be able to get married but its got nothing to do with my life or her life
8409657 i love her what more do you want we are happy leave us alone
8409658 hasta que no te documentes y veas que tus preguntas hace a os
8409659 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8409660 hey i get the feeling i make you a bit uncomfortable
8409661 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8409662 we call unanimously on the russian government to implement in full the six point peace plan brokered by president sarkozy on behalf of the eu in particular to withdraw its forces behind the pre conflict lines
8409663 we reassert our strong and continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders and underline our respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8409664 i wouldnt agree that we really have a threat of a new cold war russia was is and will continue to be the last country in the world that would want a repeat of the cold war
8409665 unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8409666 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8409667 what are you making for diner tonight i am hungry
8409668 another time maybe i think ill have a frozen burrito instead
8409669 ele estava frente de seu tempo e fez tudo sozinho
8409670 i have a loan from the slc do i have to pay the 25 deposit no the slc will pay the university on behalf of your fees
8409671 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8409672 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8409673 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8409674 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8409675 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8409676 obviously it was a big relief for a lot of us we all know what shawne brings to this team especially the defense
8409677 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8409678 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8409679 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8409680 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform
8409681 the days he practiced out here was going 100 he looked like shawne merriman to me
8409682 it is going to be something he has to manage i see him going out and playing playing on first and second downs and playing on third downs and rushing the passer if managing it means reducing his snaps at different times or picking specific situations where he doesnt need to be on the field that is what we will do
8409683 the people that want to be arrested will be at the front of the crowd and those that do not want to be arrested will be in the rear of the crowd this comes from the protest organizers
8409684 and thats why senator obama and i voted for retroactive immunity for the telcos
8409685 im not gonna take any lectures on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton everyday
8409686 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by those kind of antics
8409687 nobody has spent more time over the last two years attacking democrats than keith olbermann and chris matthews and im just not going to get lectured on how to be a good democrat from them
8409688 and i wasnt gonna stand for it anymore ive spent my entire adult life working for democratic causes and candidates and im not gonna have my credentials challenged

8409711 eigentlich hatte ich gehofft dass es ihr nach der geburt ihres sohnes besser gehen w rde
8409712 aber teilweise wurde es sogar noch schlimmer noch katastrophaler sie schleppte das kind berall mit hin zog n chtelang mit ihm durch die szene
8409713 davor wohnte christiane mit elias in spandau aber dort f hlte sie sich beobachtet ihr verfolgungswahn brach wieder aus sie sagte ein nachbar sei schon dreimal hinter ihr hergezogen au erdem w rde st ndig gebohrt um sie fertigzumachen und sie w rde durch die elektrische zahnb rste abgeh rt

8409716 ich habe ihr gesagt sie soll sich in psychiatrische behandlung begeben um herauszufinden was mit ihr los ist damit das innere mal nach au en gekramt wird aber das lehnt sie strikt ab sie sagt sie sei nicht verr ckt wenn ich sie dazu bewegen k nnte da bin ich mir sicher da k nnte ihr geholfen werden sie ist ziemlich verwirrt zurzeit

8409760 barack obama s father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the koranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
8409761 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
8409762 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim

8409774 how was it that by 1900 britain controlled nearly a quarter of the world
8409775 although we may be ashamed to admit it the slave trade is an integral part of british history it is inextricably linked to trade colonisation industrialisation and the british empire
8409776 it is important that children learn about this and its links to wider world history such as the american civil rights movement

8409787 retrospectives initially were not a part of scrum at all there was supposed to be a retrospective part during the sprint review over the time it evolved into two separate sections sprint review focused on what and sprint retrospective focused on how
8409788 iteration retrospectives are carried out at the end of the every iteration the main goal is the daily habits improvement by discussing of what went wrong what went well team gets a chance to share the individual observations aid daily problems and eventually grow as a constantly improving team not to loose the power of periodic retrospection it is very important for an iteration retrospective to result in a specific set of changes reviewing own work takes emotional energy and people would not be willing to invest it if it wont result in a visible outcome

8409794 the money that i received from the hiring i always share with my team and also keep the rest of the money in the bank in order to buy food electricity gas and buy more dancing cloths from cambodia
8409795 we have all kinds of classical and traditional dancing cloths here

8409819 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8409820 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8409821 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8409822 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serio us threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world

8409834 so at this stage they believe she may have died as the result of the consumption of some prescribed drug though not prescribed to her
8409835 but we are seeing a number of drug deaths in queensland at the moment and look its a huge risk for anyone taking illicit drugs you simply do not know what you are getting thats the bottom line
8409836 it is very important with matters like this that people take into consideration the risks that they put themselves at
8409837 they should minimise the harm by doing such things as using with other people or using half as much as they normally would and really being aware of the risks that are current at present
8409838 we need to have an independent inquiry an independent group to verify the amount of water thats there

8409971 creemos que vamos a conseguir la condena perpetua para los genocidas lo que venimos peleando hace treinta y dos a os aunque lamentablemente ste no es el juicio con el que nosotros hubi semos querido iniciar venimos luchando hace mucho tiempo para que se juzgue por centro clandestino de detenci n a todos los represores y por todas las v ctimas
8409972 men ndez no puede eludir la c rcel com n por la condena que pesa sobre el en el anterior juicio de c rdoba el tribunal no puede desconocer este antecedente y tenemos confianza en que lo mismo se determine para bussi yo estuve en la c rcel de villa urquiza como detenida pol tica durante la dictadura y es el lugar que le corresponde a este genocida
8409973 el genocidio empez mucho antes del golpe militar es muy importante para nosotros porque fundamentalmente este juicio ha permitido que mucha gente que hasta este momento no hab a denunciado haber pasado por los centros clandestinos se est acercando a denunciar lo cual va a ser muy importante para los pr ximos juicios

8409977 tenemos expectativas con casi la certeza de que va a ser escuchado el pedido del fiscal de condena porque por lo que se vio en el juicio ha sido claro el plan sistem tico que se aplic en tucum n la responsabilidad de bussi y de men ndez y como eso est probado no s lo en el caso de vargas aignase
8409978 creemos que van a ser condenados y esperamos que sea a c rcel com n es nuestro pedido de hace muchos a os c rcel perpetua com n y efectiva para los genocidas esperamos que este tribunal est a la altura de este pedido
8409979 esperamos que se de c rcel com n que es lo que merece pero es un punto conflictivo y no s que decidir el tribunal hay que esperar ser a el broche de oro para que est n donde tienen que estar
8409980 este es un juicio hist rico y si la condena es ejemplificadota abre las puertas de las condenas de las sucesivas causas que van a entrar
