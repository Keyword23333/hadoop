3390001 roundness is just an indicator that this object has undergone evolution and that it will exhibit geological processes
3390002 i have no platform so what i will end up saying will depend largely on what mark sykes says
3390003 these classifications say much more about an objects identity than whether its self gravity made it round or whether it is the only one of its kind in the neighborhood
3390004 why not rethink the solar system as multiple overlapping families of objects then the way you organize the properties is up to you the fuss over pluto doesnt have to play out as a death in the neighborhood it could mark instead the birth of a whole new way of thinking about our cosmic backyard

3390065 we are hoping and praying that it will be a positive response
3390066 as south africans we should celebrate the fact that the persistence of our president as a facilitator has got the parties in zimbabwe to a point where they are actually talking

3390075 what is your most burning question about parenting your college student
3390076 he had differences with the selectors over the selection of some players and was not happy with the situation
3390077 the only reason he has gone is because the task force felt he would be the best man to talk to the players in australia and new zealand and assure them about the situation in pakistan
3390078 we knew the 3g iphone would be big but we didnt expect iphone accessory sales to overtake ipod accessory sales until at least 2009
3390079 the colossal demand for the invisible shield iphone 3g full body protector our no1 product in july shows that iphone owners want an almost invisible solution to keep their iphone scratch free weve also been inundated with orders for iphone chargers mostly those for use in car our biggest seller for july was the gear4 roadtour dual charger
3390080 now that the iphone has gone mainstream and is available free on certain o2 contracts weve seen a very different type of buyer visit iworld co uk this person isnt shopping for ipod accessories they want to kit out their iphone with the best gear so weve built them a dedicated section found by clicking on the tab at the top of any page on the website we already stock over 200 product lines for the iphone including iphone cases iphone chargers and iphone speakers
3390081 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3390082 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3390083 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3390084 well i am a person who goes and thinks by my heart i do whatever my heart tells me to do i am not sure what man management is the team is like my own family i treat them the way a person will treat his own family
3390085 i think my team members were obviously there behind me other than that my family and friends are always behind me
3390086 i will play the way the team requires me to play and i will come onto bat whenever the team requires me to do so it is not an experiment
3390087 there is irfan pathan who is doing quite well i am sure players like praveen kumar piyush chawla and others will come off age virender sehwag is bowling really well
3390088 we have a good 11 and our bench strength is also not that bad in fact we have to leave out world class bowlers like r p singh or piyush chawla from a team also batsmen like robin uthappa manoj tiwary does not find a place in the 11 this certainly shows that we have a good amount of support players

3390095 like it or not our children are in a full scale battle where their health and their lives are at stake as parents we need to actively arm our children with valuable life lessons so they can flourish as adults thats why we created wisenhimer
3390096 wisenhimer takes childrens natural love of learning through creativity and discovery into the 21st century the most exciting feature of wisenhimer is that it teaches the user as they play children earn points and advance by learning about healthy living and practicing healthy habits in the real world
3390097 our team created the concept of the site but it was our children and their friends who actually refined the site to what it is today
3390098 they pushed us and the site is better for their efforts my nine year old son sam is one of the members of our childrens advisory team cat and my seven year old daughter sallie both gave us great insight into what was fun interesting and attractive for kids
3390099 this may have been caused by growing conditions on the farm or storage conditions after harvest
3390100 i could not have asked any more from the boys
3390101 if we play like we played this week we can beat australia the key is to turn up like we did this week in every game
3390102 thats going to be a very interesting series one im really going to watch closely
3390103 hopefully we can keep everybody fit for australia and if we can round off the season with a win that would be great
3390104 but this one is the one that has meant most to us
3390105 we have waited a long time for this moment we came here with a goal in mind and that was to win the series and we are really chuffed to have done it
3390106 ive been seven days in the job now and ive enjoyed every single minute of it
3390107 its going to take some time to see his style and how things develop

3390109 he was magnificent i asked him to be like the old steve harmison and he was im definitely going to get the best out of steve
3390110 every day in the news were hearing about the effects of the credit crunch and ways we can try to save money on household expenditure
3390111 a recent report highlighted that we throw away approximately a third of the food we buy and this trial alone has shown that on average households are throwing away around 4kg of good food per week
3390112 so perhaps that will give people food for thought next time theyre filling up their shopping trolley
3390113 the damn dietitians just want to keep counting calories with not an ounce of interest in describing what they actually observe
3390114 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3390115 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3390116 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3390117 deliver a powerful and flexible open source testing solution as a real alternative to spirent avalanche and ixia ixload
3390118 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3390119 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3390120 you know lunatics difference from other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3390121 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3390122 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3390162 i think these are good principles to settle the problem to end this dramatic situation these principles can be used both by georgia and south ossetia
3390163 if the georgian side is really ready to sign it and send its troops back to their original positions and do what these principles stipulate then the path towards the gradual normalisation of the situation in south ossetia will be opened

3390211 we warn muslims to be wary of all forms of unbeliever democracy because they are just a ploy by the zionist crusader alliance to trick you
3390212 thus whoever claims to be a democratic muslim or a muslim who calls for democracy is like one who says about himself i am a jewish muslim or i am a christian muslim the one worse than the other he is an apostate infidel
3390213 the latest coup in mauritania could never have succeeded without the agreement of america france and israel
3390214 for this reason we warn muslims to be wary of all forms of unbeliever democracy because they are just a ploy by the zionist crusader alliance to trick you
3390215 o people of mauritania you need to get back to islam and and dont hesitate to wage holy war jihad to fight the jews and the christians together with the apostate governments

3390230 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3390231 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3390232 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3390233 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went

3390249 uns sind f lle bekannt in denen von konten der betroffenen verbraucher geld abgebucht wurde obwohl diese unmissverst ndlich jegliche teilnahme an einem gl cksspiel abgelehnt hatten
3390250 es ist ein problem dass die institute einzugserm chtigungen nicht pr fen das l dt zum missbrauch ein
3390251 dazu reicht eine kontonummer die banken pr fen noch nicht einmal ob der name und die nummer berhaupt zusammengeh ren gibt es das konto wird der betrag abgebucht
3390252 sie m ssen dann auch f r die entsprechende sicherheit sorgen
3390253 dazu haben die betreffenden mindestens sechs wochen zeit bei unberechtigten abbuchen sogar l nger
3390254 die banken behaupten immer dass die verbraucher kein risiko tragen doch was wenn jemand die frist vers umt
3390255 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3390256 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3390257 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3390258 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3390259 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3390260 more than you ever wanted to know about fighter planes
3390261 refers to the plane as a versatile little fighter bomber
3390262 help me understand how the current management team gets the company to 50mm a year in revenue
3390263 do you think you and your team are strong enough to get it over the finish line
3390264 whats the track record of your management team with respect to successful exits
3390265 are you willing to step down as ceo at some point
3390266 look im the founder and were running a million miles an hour towards being successful as you can see here the objective is to find a financial partner and a solid board to help me as the founder grow the management team and knock this baby out of the park
3390267 some things you never want to say so i wont but it was just weird the way the scoring went every time raushee would score somehow this kid lee got points also i dont know
3390268 i felt like i should have been up after every round
3390269 i felt like it wasnt the right scoring to come this far and lose in the first round it aint right it doesnt seem real to me
3390270 we were screaming for him to throw punches but he was looking up the stands and they were telling him to move
3390271 i came this far to lose in the first round again
3390272 it should be the right scoring and it should be fair to everybody i felt like a lot more punches should have been scored
3390273 i think hes going to get it all figured out
3390274 i dont think theres going to be anything left for him but to get this championship done at this olympics
3390275 i felt like i shed off a lot of pressure and burden
3390276 if he has a good competition i dont think it will be possible to step up and take over his position in the all around
3390277 hes got one thing on his mind and thats winning
3390278 awarding the olympics to china was certainly motivated and inspired by a noble idea but the experiment has failed
3390279 affinity frauds are especially pernicious because the victims tend to let their guards down in circumstances where they might otherwise proceed with much more caution

3390283 as far as we know there has not been a fatality in britain but there have been a few in other parts of the world
3390284 if someone gets stung by one of these it will really spoil their day
3390285 but people do not need to panic if people get stung they should seek medical advice
3390286 it is very rare to have them here and now we have had four within a week
3390287 anybody who finds them should stay clear of them and report them to us it is best not to touch them

3390297 craig will be on our ticket when we run in the state government elections in 2011
3390298 it is great to see a local kid who is a local hero like craig getting involved in wanting to make a difference
3390299 we will go with whatever the members decide but it would be harder without a guaranteed poker machine revenue stream
3390300 i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3390301 my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them
3390302 i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3390303 i used to be a game developer so im not a big evil corporate guy
3390304 we are gaming experts we know games from the ground up we are pioneers
3390305 did this really happen could i have done such a thing
3390306 oh yeah you sure did you were out of your mind
3390307 we managed to get one out we just couldnt reach the other
3390308 he had a beautiful expansive garden he was known for it
3390309 these kids have said we want you to come with us but no explanation was given
3390310 the victim said no and the seven year old allegedly has produced an implement and stabbed her in the hand
3390311 weve spoken to the child and his parents about the incident but there wont be any formal action taken
3390312 a matter has to be referred whenever a child is deemed at risk
3390313 both the victim and the offender are under 16 and there are mandatory reporting requirements but i dont know whether this one fits the bill
3390314 i find it funny that all of these people are commenting on me saying im a terrible role model and yet none of them have ever been into my classroom and watched me teach and see how i interact with the kids
3390315 i certainly understand my responsibilities as a teacher and i think people are getting a bit carried away the kids know me for who i am and they are the ones who are with me everyday not these people who have arced up i wish they would come into the classroom and sit with me
3390316 it would be naive to think that in the modelling world people dont do shots in their underwear its all part and parcel of that
3390317 i flew back from shooting in sydney on friday morning for my school sports day which as a pe teacher is the biggest day of the year and i was wondering how they would take to the show
3390318 parents told me their kids were jumping up and down in their loungerooms when they watched me make it through so the support i have received has been lovely
3390319 do something positive to remedy this problem before other families are torn apart
3390320 our family and alexs family will never be the same
3390321 i really feel for alexs mother ms kelly and alexs family i really do know the pain they must be enduring at the moment and it will not get any better for a long time
3390322 on the 4th august 2001 my 15 year old nephew timothy winkler also took his own life because of constant bullying whilst also attending kadina high school at lismore
3390323 how many more young lives and families will be destroyed before this bullying is addressed and eradicated
3390324 when someone takes their own life the pain and suffering does not stop with the death of that person
3390325 its the loved ones left behind who suffer through no fault of their own
3390326 they suffer guilt complexes like why didnt i see it coming where did i fail but the truth is it is not their fault
3390327 my brother timothys father battled with this along with the rest of the family until it became too much for him on 22 4 2003 when he took his own life to stop his own pain and suffering
3390328 surely the objective is to stamp out bullying and in the process save lives
3390329 qantas discovered an irregularity with paperwork for these aircraft during an internal integrity check of maintenance records
3390330 we regularly check our records and detect a record keeping anomaly on average once a year
3390331 well be obviously extending the scope of that review to investigate these maintenance documents
3390332 its the only way of ensuring all the work on the aircraft that needs to be done has been done
3390333 i wanted to bring him back whole to his mother
3390334 it was incredibly hard and it was incredibly emotional but i couldnt go against my sons wishes this is what he wanted
3390335 it was on his licence and we had all talked about it its a hard decision as a parent to make but why should my son have any less rights after his death than he had in life this is what he chose and we had to respect that
3390336 we thought about bringing him back on life support but then we were worried about what effects it would have legally on the case if he died in australia not in greece and we didnt want those thugs to get away with this
3390337 we are crying for that boy and our cousin i get goose bumps every time i think about it
3390338 my brother said the operation was done and everything went all right
3390339 their the zammits son has lost his life and they say we must give his organs to someone else to save more lives they are very very kind people and our family is very very grateful
3390340 i wanted to bring him back whole to his mother
3390341 people hear that word disco and they see bellbottoms and that 70s show no no no

3390343 with sdv i can keep experimenting with remixes that were working on i can keep playing new stuff and i can keep finding old records
3390344 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3390345 her chin was almost entirely cut off she had a huge gash in her arm that looked like a really deep wound that was bleeding profusely she asked me to hold her and i could feel a lot of gashes in her back as well
3390346 well one of the advantages of having experience in military and national security matters is you get the wisdom that comes with it i think hes is correctly calling this situation he said when he looked in the eyes of vladimir putin he saw a k a g and a b i think he senses correctly that russia still has an aggressive posture in terms of its foreign policy and this could be very well an example of that so senator mccains response an aggressive response as it relates to the u n as it relates to nato as it relates to sending the secretary of state to europe i think are the right steps and it reflects his wisdom and experience
3390347 action with respect to threats to the peace breaches of the peace and acts of aggression
3390348 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council we should move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion
3390349 p resent day retirees have always been paid their benefits from the taxes paid by current workers that has been true from social securitys inception
3390350 colorado retirees mccain should reject social security benefits after calling it an absolute disgrace
3390351 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace

3390354 if they mess up and come back i am happy they are one step closer to getting to the place where they say not ill have jesus which is a bit condescending but rather
3390355 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3390356 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3390357 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3390358 the word is that he made more money than the beatles did during his period of time
3390359 they were fresh honest and had what i thought a sort of presence and star quality whatever that is
3390360 brian put us in suits and all that and we made it very very big
3390361 we were in a daydream till he came along we had no idea what we were doing

3390364 more and more people are being quite open with who they are even when blogging still some people keep blogging using their handles
3390365 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3390366 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3390367 too many of these small coastal cetaceans end up as bycatch in fisheries
3390368 this remains the main threat to them and it is only going to get worse
3390369 did not expect to learn much but she was looking forward to sleeping working out and taking long vacations
3390370 an mba course tries to teach people in a classroom the lessons which can only be properly learned in the actual arena of business valuation negotiation trading hiring and firing it also creates an ethical risk by turning the academic pursuit of business ingenuity into a goal in itself
3390371 its going to be another key game between two teams that know each other very well and a team that is used to winning the u s a
3390372 to be frank im still pretty annoyed about the loss i didnt think we played our best soccer tonight so its kind of this mixture of emotions right now
3390373 im thrilled that were through im really excited about that but im have to let the annoyedness go before i can really enjoy it
3390374 we played very well it was a high level soccer game between two very strong teams
3390375 there was more at stake for sweden of course you could see they were very pumped up for the task
3390376 in the area where we live those children are 12 miles from school
3390377 thats a long walk what are they going to do
3390378 while school systems are working hard to limit programming cuts the sharp increase in costs will have a negative impact on children especially disadvantaged children unless the states and federal government act quickly to provide relief
3390379 we wouldnt do the four day school week if we had money
3390380 with the state budget the way it is theres just no hope right now
3390381 the mortgage crisis going on means there are fewer property owners fewer property taxes being paid

3390408 i really never think at all my best races ive never remembered today i was talking and talking to myself
3390409 tom was in the green room with kobe bryant and lebron james and tom looked the size of a basketball next to them
3390410 i went up to him and asked if i could have my picture taken with him and he said to me hows your injured leg i had to text my mum kobe asked about my leg she was shocked it was just amazing
3390411 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way

3390413 we will soon find out whether their athletes can indeed hack this sort of pressure because weve seen from both british sportsmen and women in the past that theyve been known to choke under the pressure when up against the aussies
3390414 great britain may have been in lane seven and eight but um they seemed to be getting there for a country that has very few swimming pools and not much soap
3390415 ive won a lot in my career he has won a super cup and another little cup probably he needs to change mentality but maybe he is too old to do it
3390416 i think that if i would have been the one to ask chelsea owner roman abramovich for frank lampard he would have come to juventus

3390433 the grant centers on things that already are important to the school district the goals of increasing academic success for all students strengthening student student and student adult relationships and improving post secondary outlooks
3390434 working with a grant is a good sign and provides some resources toward the improvements of our high schools but there is a lot of important work that goes ahead in the next five years
3390435 johnny thank you for everything without you i would be nowhere we will make it big vanessa hudgens

3390437 john edwards a former united states senator from north carolina and democratic party presidential candidate admitted to an extramarital affair which was initially alleged and published by the national enquirer an american supermarket tabloid newspaper the story had been neglected by some members of the american mainstream media the enquirer cited claims by an anonymous source that edwards had engaged in the affair with rielle hunter a filmmaker hired to work for his presidential campaign and that the relationship had produced a child
3390438 this is his office thats how i look at michaels pool
3390439 hes going to work and his work is performing at his highest level
3390440 before he swims you can wring your hands and rock back and forth even though theres nothing we can do about it
3390441 theres nothing we can do to help him but your heart really races we are more nervous this time then we were in athens but it never ceases to be exciting
3390442 he wants to come in and do the best that he can do and he wants to bring swimming to a whole other platform he just wants to have a good time and do his best
3390443 we take every race and we celebrate that were relieved when its over but we can look forward to the next phase
3390444 because so many moms relate to her and have responded to the way she reacts to her sons great success
3390445 its like a roller coaster we just keep going up and down
3390446 matt i dont really know how to say this to you but weve decided to go in another direction i dont feel like this is working out
3390447 that was ten years ago we were essentially alone or it felt that way
3390448 now we have over 900 families in our membership we conduct workshops where people discuss the issues surrounding parenthood and what the legal boundaries are and offer meetings where people can exchange notes when i started this was a side gig now being coordinator has become a fulltime job
3390449 what we are pleading for is the state to take greater control over our relationships i am violently opposed to the common law provisions
3390450 policing ourselves to be less offensive to the majority is to be part of our own oppression
3390451 we did consider the other option we thought about getting a close friend to do this but that didnt last for long
3390452 we actually didnt have a close friend we thought would be appropriate it seemed like wed really be forcing it if we tried to make a relationship fit the circumstance
3390453 we knew that in many regards this means you have a pseudo parent around beyond the two lesbian moms how would that work out
3390454 oh i stopped on my way home today and got fresh strawberys
3390455 there were a lot of youngsters getting very nervous and who didnt know how to deal with pressure

3390462 high commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices but rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers particularly in africa
3390463 people just cannot afford fertiliser they were in dire straits before but now the situation is worse
3390464 strong global demand for fertilisers is stretching current production capacity to its technical limits this situation will persist until new capacity comes on line
3390465 it can take 5 7 years to open a phosphate mine 10 years for a potash mine and three years for a major nitrogen plant
3390466 sadly it is the rich who are benefiting a great deal they are selling maize to the poor at exorbitant prices
3390467 rises in basic commodity prices should be good for small growers but we are seeing that agri business is reaping all the benefits it needs a fundamental reform of the way agriculture is managed as well as more sustainable farming

3390475 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgias capital of tbilisi
3390476 theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3390477 russian occupation forces have already gone beyond the conflict zone until recently russia limited itself to aerial assaults outside of the boundaries of the conflict zone however now the russian forces are attempting to seize the control of entire georgia
3390478 today the statehood of georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty
3390479 the georgian government has accepted the elements of a peace agreement that the russian government previously said it would be willing to accept an immediate cease fire the withdrawal of forces from the zone of conflict a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from using force
3390480 have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region

3390482 the russian federation was threatening georgias territorial integrity and the council must act decisively to reaffirm it
3390483 regarding the ceasefire the russian federations statement had explained the formula that would lead to an end of bloodshed georgias withdrawal from south ossetia and agreement on the non use of force in south ossetia and abkhazia
3390484 for the success of this endeavour all armed contingents which are not authorised by respective agreements on south ossetia should leave the zone of conflict

3390502 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets
3390503 the high rates of negative equity are having a direct effect on home sales figures as weve seen considerable growth in foreclosure transactions and homes selling for a loss unfortunately while there are a few bright spots like pittsburgh oklahoma city and austin that reached record high values most markets are likely to remain in negative territory for the next few quarters given the magnitude of current year over year declines

3390511 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3390512 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3390513 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3390515 brands spend millions each year to make an impression with consumers it has been fascinating to see that when you strip away the packaging and actually sample the product the brand image or personality has little impact on taste
3390516 i think it does damage the image of the fringe not just with the ticket buying public but with companies like ours i dont know if id trust the fringe any more
3390517 because they want to perform better but at the same time they get more supporters from the audience and the chinese people i think great athletes dont mind who cheers they concentrate on one thing competition

3390533 on air with no voltage mods it seems that the maximum clock speeds that can be achived are right in the neighborhood of 766mhz on the gpu cores and 1105mhz on the gddr3 memory i say this after benchmarking two reference design cards from different manufacturers that basically overclocked identically the difference between the two cards clock speeds can be counted on one hand the 166mhz overclock on the gpu core offers an increase in performance in many of the game benchmarks tested keeping the cores cool by manually increasing the fan speed to 100 percent does help in achieving a higher overclock just not more that 766mhz on the core in this case 166mhz on the core and 105mhz on the memory are respectable overclocks when it comes down to it when the cpu speed is ramped up the 9800gx2 takes off this card from palit performed almost identically the the xfx model i looked at several months ago scores of close to 19000 in 3dmark06 with the cpu at 3 6ghz show the potential of the card while you can always hope for more ultimately what you get on air is what you get
3390534 i was traveling throughout north and south america and used the service to back up copies of documents in case of emergency
3390535 we know there was definitely a lot of customer problems and when we looked at some individual accounts some people didnt have any files and some people had all their files
3390536 mediamaxs intent was to migrate users and files from the mediamax application and old streamload mediamax storage system into the new tlu the linkup application and the new nirvanix storage delivery network
3390537 however as documented on the tlu blog on their impending closure this migration was only partly possible and only a portion of the files were transferred
3390538 it was not possible to satisfactorily complete the move of files from mediamax to the linkup as we had expected and as a result cannot offer a service that meets your expectations and our business requirements
3390539 this is a very disappointing outcome for us and we know it has been a frustrating experience for many of our customers
3390540 we were paying them a pretty significant amount of money to manage the servers and storage
3390541 i think its a horrible outcome its a worst case scenario for really everybody involved
3390542 the mediamax application and database front end which nirvanix has no access to ownership of the mediamax application front end and user data belongs solely to mediamax inc
3390543 over the last year or so there were a number of problems that contributed to not being able to successfully migrate data to the linkup
3390544 system administrator ran a script that misidentified active account data and disassociated physical files from their owners
3390545 this led to files being marked offline in the old streamload mediamax file system when they shouldnt have been
3390546 this means that all files and pointers to those files are replicated within the system
3390547 furthermore a series checks and balances has been installed natively within the nirvanix framework if a customer deletes a reference to a file the system logs the removal of the reference and leaves the physical file associated intact after three days the pointer to the physical file is logged with a time stamp and the pointer to that file is removed finally after eight days of the original removal of the customers reference the file is deleted off of nirvanix storage at any point during this eight day process the file can be fully recovered
3390548 nirvanix was featured at networkworlds demo 08 conference and tabbed by network world as one of 10 storage

3390574 we will soon find out whether their athletes can indeed hack this sort of pressure because weve seen from both british sportsmen and women in the past that theyve been known to choke under the pressure when up against the aussies

3390590 the mccain camp seems to have gotten some traction by associating obama with two tabloid stars that no one would ever even think would have anything important to say
3390591 mccains team picked two celebrities that middle americans associate as pampered frivolous stars famous for being famous and it is hard to argue otherwise
3390592 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
3390593 i will always always always put my country first i have done that from the time i was in prison and was offered a chance to go home before my comrades i put my country first then and will continue to put country first

3390595 on monday mccain addresses the brutal russian invasion of georgia and while on vacation obama releases the mccain celebrity ad puts it all in a nutshell
3390596 i want a serious president i want someone with a level head some class and a great deal of smarts
3390597 i will always always always put my country first except when its politically expedient for me to do otherwise such as when i voted to preserve waterboarding yes i know i am on record as strongly supporting the army field manual standard of interrogation but over the past few years people have come to expect nothing less than jaw dropping mind numbing hypocrisy from todays republican party and thats why im a strong contender for bushs 3rd term now what about that prissy obama guy eh
3390598 obamas campaign is about one man while his own campaign is about the country as a whole
3390599 the people who support obama have not evaluated his actual qualifications or skills which he will need to perform the actual position
3390600 sure the guy gives a good speech but we dont know if he can do the things he says he wants to do
3390601 why isnt anyone picking up the mccain plagarism story portions of his speech on the russia georgia conflict were lifted straight out of wikipedia
3390602 john mccain has found a soft spot in the previously impenetrable defenses of barack obama
3390603 mccains line of attack attacking obama as another bimbo eruption celebrity is absolute genius
3390604 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3390605 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3390606 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city
3390607 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used

3390620 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3390621 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3390622 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3390623 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3390624 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3390625 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside

3390660 there was outrage in the mainstream media when abc anchor man charles gibson asked obama a serious question about the economic effects of a capital gains tax
3390661 the fact that senator obama did not have a very coherent answer made things worse for charles gibson since obama can do no wrong in the eyes of many of his supporters they resented gibsons having asked him such a question
3390662 the question incidentally was why senator obama was advocating a higher capital gains tax rate when experience had shown that the government typically collected more revenue from a lower capital gains tax rate than from a higher rate
3390663 senator obama acted as if he had never thought about it that way

3390668 its not a perfect or even moderately good analogy but i find myself thinking of opera mini as a tortoise to safari mobiles hare the latter is downright suave and spiffy and all that operas mobile browser on the other hand is moving steadily into relative ubiquity its rise seems deceptively understated too
3390669 the list of agreements opera now holds with various mobile manufacturers and network operators is pretty extensive i wont treat you to the unabridged rundown but suffice it to say that many many millions add another few manys in for good measure of mobile phone users are being treated automatically to opera mini installs upon purchase of new devices that or the next gadget on their wishlist is sporting the software just this week the company announced a deal with o2 to increase its market share even further it also has parties like micromax swisscom debitel haier and ten by orange in its repertoire the number of mobile users that have downloaded the mini browser by their own volition counts strong as well
3390670 q did opera get a headstart in this area they are on phones and the nintendo wii a im not sure i care about the wii as a platform people were critical of us last year saying opera has sewn it all up but they won the last market they have three times as many people as us you have opera browsers on the phone but who uses it

3390910 so there are things that congress can do and we have voted on this over and over again but the republicans and the president have resisted instead they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them

3390916 most people own surge protectors but are unaware they are only protecting their equipment against lightning strikes representing less than one percent of power disturbances as a result equipment continues to fail with power surges taking the lions share of the blame even though surge protectors are typically deployed surge protection technology has not changed in more 20 years even as digital and video electronics have been revolutionized in our mind this represents a significant market gap that innovolt is directly addressing

3390941 property taxes are a problem but cutting schools is the wrong answer
3390942 governor patersons tax cap will hurt school kids all around new york state
3390943 this kind of gimmick has devastated public education in other states similar schemes in california illinois and massachusetts led to overcrowded classrooms teacher lay offs and severe cuts in education funding we spent 15 years debating the need for a statewide solution to the school funding crisis for school districts large and small we cant risk undoing the promise of quality education with a tax cap policy that has failed in other states
3390944 a tax cap only limits the rate at which property rates can go up another proposal the called a circuit breaker that is supported by many members of the state assembly would cut taxes for most working and retired families
3390945 we need to keep our schools strong to ensure that we can produce more skilled workers and keep those that are already here from moving to other states in a highly competitive economy our education system must be top notch in order to attract and keep good jobs here an economic downturn is not the time to cut investments in education
3390946 people think im really confident but i do get self conscious like many women about stripping off in public
3390947 i havent been willingly photographed in a bikini for seven years and i dont think ill do it again at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was a big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self

3390964 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3390965 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3390966 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3390967 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3390968 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3390973 despite threats and sanctions by a number of big powers our nation is robust and is continuing living its own life as they cannot put obstacles in the path of our progress
3390974 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
3390975 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
3390976 our stance would not change with sanctions or the threat of sanctions
3390977 the failure of contacts between the iranian government and jundollah
3390978 let me say something here and if it were not so i simply would not say it

3390986 herr steinmeier muss jetzt dringend daf r sorgen dass der wortbruch nicht zur tradition innerhalb der spd wird
3390987 nachdem herr beck jetzt zweimal mit seinem kopf vor die hessische wand gelaufen ist ist herr steinmeier gefordert jetzt f hrung zu zeigen
3390988 es geht um eine m glicherweise fatale richtungsentscheidung der spd

3390999 die seite steht und f llt mit dem content den die user einstellen
3391000 weve right sized them and done a number of initiatives to make them more guest friendly and more right sized to the market place
3391001 it wasnt the layoffs it was the actual size of the floor being reduced in size
3391002 when you talk human resources obviously thats employees but it doesnt necessarily mean employees were cut
3391003 it could mean hours of operation might have changed the number of table games had changed
3391004 any time you reduce staff by nearly 100 youve let go obligations whether its vacation time or health benefits
3391005 there seems to be some evidence that perhaps the employees those who have been let go and those that currently work they may not have gained very much in benefits from this substantial increase
3391006 kinder sind die schw chsten mitglieder unserer gesellschaft sie brauchen unseren besonderen schutz
3391007 wir freuen uns deshalb sehr dass es uns gelungen ist die schulwege in steinheim insbesondere f r die grundsch ler durch die schaffung von hilfeinseln mit dem kinderkommissar leon noch sicherer zu machen
3391008 diese zahlen sind grunds tzlich nicht besorgniserregend dennoch ist jedes kind das auf dem weg zur schule oder sonst in der ffentlichkeit verletzt oder ausgeraubt wird ein opfer zuviel
3391009 rund 50 gesch fte vier kindertagesst tten sowie die steinheimer nachbarschaftshilfe haben sich als hilfeinsel zur verf gung gestellt man kann sagen dass nahezu der gesamte stadtteil steinheim hinter dem hilfeinsel projekt steht
3391010 kinder die von fremden angesprochen oder verfolgt werden die sich von anderen bedroht f hlen sich verlaufen haben unwohl f hlen oder sich sonst in einer gefahrenlage befinden k nnen nun ohne langes suchen in den hilfeinseln anlaufstellen und menschen finden die sich ihrer annehmen und ihnen helfen
3391011 bei dem kinderkommissar leon handelt es sich um eine programmunterlegte sympathiefigur der hessischen polizei
3391012 mit hilfe dieser figur die bei den kindern in hessen seit ihrer einf hrung schon einen hohen bekanntheitsgrad erreicht hat wollen wir die pr vention f r und mit kindern intensivieren das zugrundeliegende konzept umfasst unter anderem ma nahmen in bezug auf die sicherheit im stra enverkehr wie beispielsweise die verkehrssicherheit von fahrr dern oder die einf hrung von hilfeinseln daneben werden den kindern altersgerechte und eng an ihrer lebenswirklichkeit orientierte kriminalpr ventive botschaften zum thema eigentum fremdenfeindlichkeit und anderen bereichen der kriminalit t vermittelt
3391013 wir beabsichtigen das projekt nach etwa einem halben jahr erstmals auszuwerten
3391014 wir wollen uns bei allen herzlich bedanken die mitgeholfen haben dieses sinnvolle projekt mit leben zu f llen unser besonderer dank gilt stephanie k mmerer von der stabsstelle pr vention der stadt hanau und martin enz vom polizeipr sidium s dosthessen die das projekt federf hrend vorbereitet haben die enorme resonanz im stadtteil steinheim spricht f r eine hohe hilfsbereitschaft und zivilcourage in der hanauer bev lkerung auf die wir stolz sein d rfen
3391015 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
3391016 it is vital cica understand that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3391017 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3391018 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3391019 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3391020 therefore the mechanism is in place for all applicants to express that they are not content when their decision letter is sent to them
3391021 all requests are considered on the basis of individual circumstances
3391022 contributed to the circumstances which gave rise to the injury
3391023 i think the fact that they rolled over so quickly means they knew all along that what they were doing was wrong
3391024 its quite shocking that the government let it get this far i will be so pleased if those women get their cases reviewed and are told theyre not to blame

3391026 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
3391027 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
3391028 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
3391029 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
3391030 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
3391031 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed

3391033 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth

3391035 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to

3391053 basically could not do anything to prevent this tragedy from happening
3391054 were tracking a similar drought pattern as we saw in 2003 and we urge everyone to be extremely cautious
3391055 we are getting into a warmer pattern following the heavy rain we got over the weekend the weather is going to stay on the hotter warmer side for the next couple of weeks which is about as far ahead as we can reasonably predict
3391056 when you look back at the weather from 2003 as a whole starting from january it looks very similar to what the whole weather for 2008 looks like however when you just look at the summer weather then you see differences in summer of 2003 between june and august the kelowna area received 23 6 millimeters of rain since june of this year kelowna has received 51 millimeters almost double the amount
3391057 i saw this flash on the water and before i could do anything i saw the hull of the other boat followed by this horrendous noise before i knew it i was under water with my boat upside down and on top of me
3391058 i basically said my goodbyes because i thought i was dead when i opened my eyes i could see my boat lights and swam to them and found an air pocket then i dove down and got through the obstructions boat tower and popped up i hung on to my boat and was 400 yards from shore so i started yelling for help and the other boat came back
3391059 one of the fellows in the other boat said he ducked and felt my boat go right over his head were all very lucky to be alive
3391060 judging by what the other driver told me he was running at a fairly high rate of speed and as far as im concerned there were no working lights on that boat
3391061 it doesnt matter how safe you think you are when its that dark at night and other boaters dont have running lights and going at an excess speed its impossible to see them until they are driving over you its really not a good idea to be boating at night on this lake even though you might be doing everything right theres always that other person you have to worry about
3391062 rcmp attempted to arrest a 22 year old kelowna woman for causing a disturbance by fighting this woman who appeared to be very intoxicated was previously asked to leave the area after she was observed impeding traffic on leon avenue by sitting on the roadway
3391063 during the arrest the woman continued to fight with the arresting officer even after being handcuffed while she was escorted to the awaiting transporting police vehicle she kicked the escorting police officer
3391064 this vehicle was stopped at the corner of mill street and water street officers advised the individual that he was under arrest for dangerous driving however he refused to cooperate when asked to exit the vehicle
3391065 at one point pepper spray was used in an attempt to subdue the subject however this did not appear to have any affect on him
3391066 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
3391067 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
3391068 in the fall or early spring during the deer hunting season people are leaving carcasses ive also seen cows dropped off just left to rot or when people have pets die they just drop them off
3391069 if they get into the stream system there are some people in this area who actually take their water supply from the creek they could get really sick even die
3391070 ive seen everything tossed in the woods from kitchen sinks to old refrigerators and sofas its very frustrating
3391071 tree branches are not litter animal parts and carcasses are not litter litter is things like plastic bags and garbage
3391072 the litter act was designed for people throwing things out car windows more than anything if someone drives down the road and tosses a mcdonalds burger wrapper out the window that falls under the litter act i dont think when they made this legislation that it would would deal with people dumping garbage in the woods
3391073 we have to have something to investigate just saying there is someone dumping garbage wont help us depending on whats on our plate on a particular day it may not be a high enough priority to investigate
3391074 we will charge an individual and have in the past if there is sufficient evidence such as a license plate then we have the individual clean it up take it to the dump and bring a receipt to show that they dropped it off after which instead of taking court action we go by the way of writing a ticket the maximum ticket fine is 100
3391075 the cost of cleaning up illegal dump sites on public land is about 17 000 each year
3391076 thats down substantially from where it was about 10 years ago when we had a full time crew working five days a week cleaning up sites now we have a contractor who is responsible for this and basically works one day a week
3391077 this will be an excellent addition to the services we offer our small business community
3391078 bizpal will allow our entrepreneurs a more streamlined and simplified start up process

3391086 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3391087 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3391088 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3391089 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3391112 come on mums a state and shell fret less if she can see more heads of red hair around the table
3391113 and there was a pained silence and then george said
3391114 then they both just stood and glared at me so i made an excuse and left in a hurry i havent been back to london since
3391115 why dont they just go home for coffee when they only live round the corner
3391116 i had to drag him out of the room and outside for a walk eventually just because i could see my mum getting more and more annoyed he always did have a low boredom threshold
3391117 thats impossible how old are you early twenties you cant have been together twelve years
3391118 you never know i might turn out to be really tidy
3391119 why cant we just apparate there whats the point of being a wizard if you have to walk everywhere
3391120 yeah but were going there for a walk the exercise bits already covered
3391121 i can think of much better ways to keep fit than walking up hills
3391122 when we move back to the country we wont have any neighbours
3391123 why do you have to go why cant you stay here
3391124 oh dont give me the silent treatment anything but that
3391125 bugger this ive got to do something about it and right now
3391126 oh ginny ginny how i wish you were here doing this to me loving me i love you i need you
3391127 sorry to wake you i cant sleep but ill be all right dont worry
3391128 im your godfather if you need help feel free to ask
3391129 i cant sleep until i know youre all right and despite what you say youre not all right ive heard you moaning and thrashing about in your sleep
3391130 whats more i think no i know i love her but how can i ask her to be my girlfriend again
3391131 i think the real question is how can you not youll drive yourself spare if you keep this up
3391132 but i dont want to use her just for my own satisfaction
3391133 of course you dont but youve been denied so much dont deny yourself the chance to express your feelings for ginny and allow her to express hers for you even if it doesnt last at least youll have beautiful memories and they can help a lot in getting you through rough times especially if you meet again and renew your romance later on
3391134 you know how ginny and i feel about each other
3391135 i was young once too you know i understand exactly what youre going through it happens to every young man sooner or later
3391136 thats fine as far as it goes but what about now
3391137 i cant sleep like this im so hard i hurt ive got to have some relief
3391138 i think i know a way to help you but youve got to trust me and not tell anyone
3391139 then scoot over a bit and give me a minute to get there
3391140 did you ever do this for dad that is before he married mum
3391141 many blokes do that for their friends but dont worry thats all your father and i ever were close friends and brothers remember how difficult your mum was for him to convince he needed relief now and again especially when she was being particularly stubborn about going out with him i was more than happy to help him
3391142 did he ever do it for you how about remus
3391143 dont try to hold back the whole object of this is to get you some relief so you can sleep let yourself go
3391144 my pleasure and as i said feel free to ask if you need such help again and im nearby
3391145 ill keep it in mind meanwhile wed better get back to bed and get some sleep remember how molly is if she has to shout to everyone to come to breakfast
3391146 i human body and as i watch them i just want to give my own body a big hug
3391147 i can guarantee you that ms wright makes every effort to allow as many of her athletes to play as much as possible but with a squad typically consisting of two dozen girls or more there are obvious limitations in my experience ms wright was extraordinarily fair if you were to poll the hundreds of her former players and their parents i venture to say that the overwhelming majority of them would report that ms wright is not only extremely knowledgeable with respect to soccer but she is an outstanding role model she not only teaches them the fundamentals of soccer but she also imparts the values and habits that will serve them well for their entire lives in short ms wright is the very epitome of a successful high school coach and her character is above reproach
3391148 our future depends upon the development of sustainable sources of energy and chemical feedstocks that are based upon renewable resources for example dow chemical and renewable chemicals corporation are making plans to manufacture polyethylene from sugar cane
3391149 the erc test station is scheduled to be assembled by september 19 2008 and online by september 30 2008 mantra is very excited to push this technology through to the marketplace implementation of this technology will have a significant impact on our current climate change crisis
3391150 any witch or wizard who marries a muggle is taking a terrible risk
3391151 can expect deformity retardation severe anti social tendencies and often a complete lack of magical ability in addition as muggle females are ill bred to handle magical children serious complications can result in such pregnancies leading in some cases to the death of the female likewise an attempt by a witch to carry the child of a muggle male yes mr finnigan
3391152 please maam those anti social tendencies theyd be the reason so delusional then
3391153 the dark lord carries the blood of the great slytherin himself through generations of powerful wizarding families such as the gaunts and the peverells
3391154 more than powerful enough to counteract the pitiful influence of any muggle if you choose to believe disgusting rumors spread by petty small minded mudblood loving fools but you are certainly proof that no ordinary slum dragging witch can marry filth without consequence
3391155 then if were to be takin the example of the gaunts and keepin it all in kin can i ask when you and amycusll be expecting
3391156 i take no disrespect from half breed irish dung finnigan
3391157 you can wait to tell us all what possessed you once youre patched up
3391158 because the carrows wouldnt let us take you there alecto wanted you to suffer for what youve done none of us wanted to try healing spells on you while you were unconscious but ive brewed up a mixture of dittany murtlap and a few other things that should help a lot and ginny is going to give the spellwork a try for the rest oh dont give me that look this isnt potions its herbology
3391159 i wanted to set an example like harry i thought if someone stood up to her straight away folkd see it could be done you know
3391160 what we saw finnigan you ass is an excellent alternative if poking the whomping willow is inconvenient
3391161 you can give it a try while i add a little more tincture of mandrake i think
3391162 do you really think i could have lived in that house with six brothers all my life and not learned a thing or two about healing spells if wed had to take fred and george to st mungos every time they blew themselves up wed have been out on the street
3391163 you have a broken wrist a few cracked ribs a sprained ankle and more bruises than if youd been used for practice by every beater in the school thats not to mention a knot the size of a snitch on that thick head of yours two black eyes a few wand scorches and a mouth that is just starting to look human again i suggest you lie back and think about gryffindors having a tendency to be brave to the point of stupidity and then we need to talk about what you originally had in mind and make some decisions
3391164 you sounded just like harry there for a minute it was like the da again
3391165 harrys gone and so is dumbledore and so are ron and hermione and dean and justin and another dozen from the da and another hundred from the school its not like when all we had to worry about was umbridge and her little squad
3391166 but this is why we had the da in the first place isnt it because harry knew it might come to this
3391167 but i think this is worse than even harry ever guessed it would be i mean dumbledore dead snape in charge of the school death eaters teaching classes the ministry under you know who i dont think anyone could have seen this coming this fast and this completely even six months ago
3391168 or that we let ourselves be punching bags in the style of the brilliant mr finnigan i hope
3391169 ive wanted to ask you what was that hex you used on carrow i didnt recognize it is it something harry taught you personally
3391170 its one of the old ones from my nana gaelic all the ministry approved spells are off of nice proper respectable latin you know but the celts had their own brand of magic even if it got pushed off as all backward its mostly died out now but some of the old ones still remember a bit here and there mostly hexes and jinxes and the odd witchs charm you know for tellin what kind of baby youll be having and the like
3391171 my grandfather was a fakir in bombay he used to tell us that there was all kinds of magic we would never learn at hogwarts he tried to have us sent to india to learn but when our parents refused he taught us a few spells padma can even control snakes
3391172 no she cant talk to them only make them do what she wants
3391173 tell her to make that big one got eat him
3391174 thatd be nice but its just little ones normal ones like cobras and adders and i know a few french spells from one of the boys from beauxbatons
3391175 anthony goldstein comes from a family of wizards that go all the way back to the essene scholars i bet he knows some stuff in hebrew vanes always going on that her family are genuine rom those are gypsies and ernies family was so deep in the clan wars that they didnt start going to hogwarts until a hundred and fifty years ago so maybe he has something like finnigan old gaelic magic
3391176 hisd be erse not gaelic were not the same and we whipped scotland at quidditch last year
3391177 i dont know about you neville but i feel rather plain all of a sudden
3391178 yeah i mean my familys just been you know wizards normal old british wizards tut tut conjure you a cuppa
3391179 its good though i mean carrow didnt know what hit her did she she couldnt have blocked that one if shed tried and the death eaters are going to know all the usual spells no matter how much we practice protego and stupify and impedimenta arent going to be enough on their own against fully qualified dark wizards you remember what snape said about the dark arts theyre unpredictable we have to be too
3391180 i thought you were against me fightin back at them
3391181 not like that weve got to think more like your brothers ginny like the twins mischief and little rebellions well take some hits get punished sure but seamus took it too far he nearly got himself killed on the second day of the school year over nothing at all beaten is fine but no more unless the situation really calls for it
3391182 we keep the da going but just enough to get under their skin and keep the other students hopes alive nothing full fledged until its time
3391183 well until we have to we all know whats coming
3391184 the way i see it things can only go four ways one we all become good little followers of you know who
3391185 i dont see myself doing that even if i could live with myself gran would kill me
3391186 harry finds a way to stop you know who and end all of this clean and quick before the end of the year all the death eaters get rounded up and things go back to normal
3391187 but im not putting all my gold there it would be great and i believe with all my heart harrys going to get him in the end but doing it in one year with only ron and hermiones help seems like a tall order
3391188 three we graduate and were not safe here any more
3391189 cormac is dead cho and lee are in hiding roger is in st mungos in worse shape than you seamus and thats just whats in the prophet or what ginnys brothers have managed to pass on in news under labels right now he thinks theres still a chance to brainwash us in school but once were graduated we lose the safety of numbers and the protection of being kids he doesnt want the public outcry that would happen from a massacre at hogwarts but once were out were on our own
3391190 we fight if harry comes back and needs us we fight then personally thats what i believe that he can do this but hell need our help its only a matter of time before hes back but we dont have infinite time so on the very last day before school is over if theres no word from harry yet we go all out either way we make a proper battle of it take out every last death eater we can manage hopefully snape in the bargain use every exotic spell and dirty trick we can think of make them pay for everyone missing everyone terrorized everyone killed even the odds a little for harry and the order and give the public that massacre that you know who doesnt want get people outraged in a way the prophet cant cover up we still die but we die on our terms and we die accomplishing something not just picked off one by one in back alleys with our deaths glossed over and ignored
3391191 ive been looking for a way to top fred and george on their exit
3391192 i dont see myself winning any death eater popularity contests anyway so why the hell not im with you
3391193 i cant speak for padma but count me in i just hope my next life is something quieter
3391194 i said it so i guess i cant back out
3391195 all in favor of neville taking over for harry as leader of the da
3391196 then thats settled well talk to the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs later but i think as of right now dumbledores army is back
3391197 six hundred eighty one six hundred eighty two six hundred eighty three
3391198 i usually dont get hand me downs from the boys but things are well bill just got married and we dont know how much longer dad or the twins are going to be able to work so i mean theyre just pajamas
3391199 theyre kind of cute really it looks sort of like youve borrowed them from your boyfriend or something
3391200 if id done that i could have saved myself six inches in the arms and legs
3391201 you didnt come here at three in the morning to show me rons pajamas
3391202 i dreamed that id messed things up with seamus and his hisarmsandlegshadfallenoffandhewasmadatmeforit
3391203 oh it sounds so ridiculous now that ive come all the way up here
3391204 no it doesnt you were just worried about him parvati and lavender have been up to check too were all worried about him he took a hell of a beating and none of us are exactly certified healers
3391205 romilda made a really good sleeping draught shes great with potions he hasnt stirred since we gave it to him but hes still breathing and everything just fine having a rest really is whats best for him you can check on him yourself if you want
3391206 no thats okay as long as youre sure all his arms and legs are still attached
3391207 as much as they have been since carrow finished with him
3391208 i should get back to the girls dorm then im sorry i bothered you
3391209 i just what happened earlier ive been thinking about it you guys made a mistake a big mistake
3391210 just because i was the first one to say something doesnt mean you would have figured it out i know it that doesnt make me the leader i cant be the leader i cant do this i cant take that kind of responsibility im not good enough
3391211 you know youre at least as tall as ron your voice has changed and i think you shave more often than harry so it really confuses me
3391212 well that would seem to indicate that youve got a working set of what they do so i dont see why you constantly refuse to use them
3391213 im the only girl in a family of seven i could belch the entire chudley cannons fight song by the time i was four but katie bell had to tell me when i needed a bra and show me how to put the effing thing on so dont act like im supposed to be some sheltered little flower about how boys are put together
3391214 stop trying for the grandson she wishes she had and start being proud of the one she has thats not something you say to someone whose kid is something great ginny thats something you say when someone needs to settle for what theyve gotten
3391215 neville what exactly happened to your parents ive seen the cruciatus curse now i know how awful it is but its not that simple is it
3391216 they were after me i dont know why no one knows why but they thought if they could get me they could figure out what harry had done to make you know who disappear maybe they thought it was something in aurors kids or kids born in july or one year olds or my parents hid me in a closet put a silencing charm on it and concealed the door it cost them their chance to get away they couldnt tell them where he was they didnt know but if theyd said where if theyd just
3391217 fourteen hours oh god ginny they tortured them for fourteen hours the healers the body protects itself anything that causes that kind of pain for more than a few minutes it should be an awful injury injuries cause endorphins shock you pass out you die a person isnt meant to be in that kind of pain thats just pain for that long the brain cant cope if theyd just
3391218 i wasnt worth it i wish theyd known i wasnt worth it they let themselves be worse than killed for me and im nothing compared to them
3391219 you are so much stronger than i thought you were
3391220 harrys got half the wizarding world petting him and calling him a hero and consoling him about his parents rons down on himself all the time but its all in his head and hes going to figure that out one of these days even if hermione has to write it down on something heavy and beat him with it you youve carried that around all these years alone and when its weighed you down people have just added to it without even knowing it was there and the one person who did know has made it the heaviest of all that youve managed to keep going is strong enough but youve done so much more than that its amazing
3391221 i havent though i screw up everything i try im not a hero at all
3391222 i saw you fight the squad in umbridges office and the death eaters at the ministry and again at the tower youre not nearly as bad as you think you are most of the time but when you fight
3391223 ive watched you both harry fights bravely so does ron so does hermione hell were gryffindors we all fight bravely but youre something else ive never even seen anyone in the order who fights with the kind of rawness and intensity you do its a little scary honestly
3391224 thats not the same im not me when i fight its like something happens
3391225 like something starts screaming or roaring or something and it drowns out everything else and i just lose it
3391226 i think that thing is you neville its who you really are a brave powerful wizard the son of two famous aurors and a courageous soldier in your own right and if id been cooped up and shoved down and hidden that long under such a heavy load id probably start screaming if i had half a chance to get out too
3391227 lets say youre right that youre worthless a complete failure as a wizard and as a man what are you going to do about it
3391228 no you havent youve just accepted that its how things are is there any hope for your parents
3391229 no they say theres the faintest chance if lestrange dies but even thats thinner than the odds of you know who just deciding to turn himself in
3391230 so they gave their sanity really their lives for you what do you think they would say if she
3391231 if it had never happened if your parents were still fully themselves what would they be doing
3391232 and would they be proud to know that you were leading dumbledores army here at hogwarts or would they want you to back down and say you werent sure if their kid was good enough
3391233 so maybe its time to stop living because of them and start living for them
3391234 its a picture of my parents and me from before
3391235 still are now that i really look at you but taller and more hair
3391236 the chinese chomping cabbage or brassica olerasea carnivorus as it is scientifically known is like its muggle cousin a member of the mustard family the common name however is somewhat misleading although certainly a cabbage and if you have any doubts about the chomping portion i would advise you against putting your fingers too close to it it is actually native to the korean peninsula the extremely piquant nature of this particular vegetable has lead to the development of a popular native dish which attempts to replicate the flavor with somewhat less danger to the gardener in addition to the culinary uses which i recommend sparingly and only to extremely adventurous souls the chomping cabbage is a primary ingredient in pepper up potion used in cases of hypothermia
3391237 im sorry maam i guess i wasnt paying attention to what i was doing thinking about the heating properties of the cabbages and all
3391238 thats all right no harm done now as i was saying contact with the sap on bare skin must be avoided if at all possible
3391239 its my fault i think ive developed an allergy to something over here my wand just went off can i be assigned another partner please
3391240 dean thomas is no longer with us miss abbott so you may partner with mr finnigan if you wish
3391241 look its not as if im writing harry off or anything if thats what youre mad about no one is but hes not here now i dont understand why youre being this way weve always been friends i would have thought youd be well proud of me i guess
3391242 i suppose i should be shouldnt i i mean its not like harry was the only one who thought and i guess i guess its certainly a step up for you
3391243 exactly im so glad you understand that really means a lot
3391244 you could have at least had the guts to tell me yourself but no i have to hear it from demelza
3391245 she was up there for over an hour last night you git did you think no one would notice no one would say anything
3391246 neville neville neville say something im so sorry please say something neville
3391247 but i was going out with him so she decided he was a prat anyway and she went back to her other crush which had been on harry but he had been going with cho and demelza hated cho so she stopped crushing on harry while he was with her but then she went back with roger and so that made harry okay to crush again so demelza starts going after harry not as if he noticed or anything and then i break up with dean and she tries to go with dean again but he doesnt have time for her because he got back on the quidditch team as a favor to me and then i started going with harry and now im not with harry any more but hes gone and so is dean so of course when i went out last night it was obvious that shed try to use that to trash my reputation as much as she could i mean i didnt know she knew because if id known id have told you so that you knew
3391248 completely obvious you were werent were with dean who demelza did didnt did like and you were werent were with harry who she also did didnt did like so hannah abbott nearly kills me after trying to set my pants on fire in herbology makes perfect sense
3391249 demelza told hannah and every other girl in the school she could get a hold of that you and i were snogging for hours last night when like ive told her now we were actually looking after seamus and making plans for the other thing which by the way she said yes to and shes going to tell ernie and the others after dinner
3391250 wanted to kill me because only a complete git would try to steal harrys girl the moment he left and you thought i was a better friend to him than that
3391251 no remember that time last year when ron looked like hed been attacked by a flock of birds
3391252 well thats exactly what had happened hermione granger had done it just after the start of the lavender fiasco and theyre not always this dim if theyre weasleys theyre worse
3391253 ive got to go im going to be late for history of magic
3391254 but i guess hufflepuff knows now and parvati told her sister this morning so thats ravenclaw too
3391255 if everyone still has their coins ill get the information out as soon as i have it figured
3391256 okay ill make sure to keep it where i can feel it
3391257 make sure that when it happens you remind me to see that hannah has something to throw that girl doesnt miss
3391258 c limpegno russo a rispettare e garantire la sovranit della georgia un punto importante
3391259 un paese indipendente un paese sovrano e questa formula il principio della sovranit a mio parere pi importante del principio dellintegrit territoriale
3391260 senza dubbio riconosce la sovranit della georgia ma questo non significa che la parte georgiana possa fare tutto quello che vuole
3391261 lintegrit territoriale questione pi complessa ha aggiunto il leader del cremlino e anche pi difficile non pu essere definita in piazza con le manifestazioni o alle riunioni internazionali
3391262 bisogna chiedere allossezia del sud e allabkhazia se vogliono vivere dentro un singolo stato con la georgia
3391263 sulla base del vostro rapporto ho deciso di concludere loperazione per costringere le autorit georgiane alla pace
3391264 laggressore in ossezia del sud stato punito e ha subito significative perdite
3391265 abbiamo deciso di uscire dalla csi ha detto il capo di stato georgiano come riferiscono le agenzie di stampa russe ci appelliamo allucraina e agli altri stati di abbandonare la comunit degli stati indipendenti dove la russia ha un ruolo dominante
3391266 questo popolo ha arringato la folla saakashvili tra gli applausi non si arrender
3391267 non abbiamo lo stesso numero di carri armati della russia n i loro aeroplani n i loro missili ha concluso il presidente ma abbiamo la nostra unit la nostra democrazia e libert
3391268 sul territorio della georgia non sono entrate truppe del contingente di peacekeeping russo
3391269 il controllo dellaeroporto nellarea di senaki e tutti i centri abitati nella zona di sicurezza di competenza dei peacekeeping
3391270 prima di puntare per la georgia andremo a prendere i presidenti dei paesi baltici e dellucraina viktor yushchenko
3391271 thanks for your patience we will bring in both the 8gb and 16gb versions with your choice of black or white
3391272 at this stage we have not announced pricing i will share it with you very shortly
3391273 imposing house arrest and suspending the fourth amendment for law abiding people is only going to cause more problems for this city
3391274 they need to work with the community to get this resolved instead of treating all of their citizens like criminals
3391275 that one is really tough for me to talk about
3391276 a day or two ago he thought today would be the day i dont know its very frustrating it is for the player too

3391306 cuando vi el cuadro hewitt aparec a como el rival m s fuerte pero sigo viendo el torneo complicado es cierto que ante hewitt especialista en esta superficie jugu un gran partido andreev es complicado tambi n igual que el resto si alguno de los favoritos ha perdido pues mejor
3391307 las sensaciones van y vienen y ojal que ahora pueda mantener el nivel no creo tampoco que haya habido mucha diferencia entre el primer partido y este el duelo contra starace me sirvi para coger el ritmo de la competici n
3391308 hay momentos en los que est s mejor y otros peor se hace duro este es el a o que menos he parado en casa que m s he competido y eso se acusa
3391309 yo siento siempre a mi pa s en cada torneo cuando hay competiciones internacionales en unos juegos ol mpicos a n con m s raz n
3391310 no tuvimos nuestro mejor d a y casi tenemos un traspi s
3391311 el manchester united hizo una oferta por david silva que fue rechazada por el valencia
3391312 no quiere jugar en inglaterra porque est contento en el valencia
3391313 su familia est asentada y si tuviera que marcharse ser a solamente a otro club espa ol como el real madrid o el barcelona david silva comenzar la nueva temporada en el valencia
3391314 when you see our certificate of accreditation you will know that the aaahc an independent not for profit organization has closely examined our facility and procedures it means that we as an organization care enough about our patients to strive for the highest care possible
3391315 going through the process challenged us to find better ways to serve our patients and it is a constant reminder that our responsibility is to our patients and the quality of care we provide
3391316 entramos en la recta final y en los ltimos d as para preparar los primeros partidos de liga en estos d as vamos a tener muchos entrenamientos y partidos seguidos y van a ser muy importantes para ver el estado f sico antes de empezar la competici n
3391317 estos cuatro encuentros que tenemos van a ser muy importantes para ver el nivel que tenemos
3391318 es un planteamiento algo nuevo y estamos insistiendo para acabar de dominarlo
3391319 todos partimos de cero y tenemos las mismas posibilidades de jugar
3391320 queda una vacante y parece que quieren ocuparla con un central
3391321 cuanto m s tiempo se trabaja mejor te sientes con esa persona no obstante si fichan a un jugador es una decisi n del club y no podemos hacer nada
3391322 es importante seguir como hasta ahora debemos seguir asimilando los conceptos y mejorar nuestro nivel de juego nos falta adaptarnos en algunas cosas y estos encuentros nos vendr n bien para acabar de acoplarnos el equipo sigue trabajando bien
3391323 est claro que todos queremos ganarnos un puesto y la competencia es buena para que el equipo funcione
3391324 es el entrenador el que debe decidir y nosotros no podemos intervenir en esta cuesti n
3391325 debido a la actual situaci n pol tica en georgia
3391326 manny is a great athlete and he knows it hes so cocky and full of himself
3391327 i patterned him after my friend jevonte young terrific football player and so sure of himself
3391328 what was difficult for me in the movie was playing wide receiver
3391329 i played guard and fullback for mount salus christian school last year but the director knew i was the only actor who had actually played football before so they needed me at receiver
3391330 malcolm is very accomplished as an actor and impressed everyone
3391331 he really got into the character and we had a lot of fun making the movie
3391332 even when he was a small child he could tell a story and have me believe it
3391333 he was very convincing malcolm has always spoken well and been very articulate but i never dreamed he would be in a movie one day
3391334 for him to win a principal role in a major movie is amazing when you consider that those roles are normally reserved for los angeles based actors
3391335 malcolm is such a great kid and hes a very very good actor hes got a great future in the business especially if he can relocate to the west coast
3391336 ive been on a bunch of auditions and i just had a good feeling about this one
3391337 when i got to shreveport where the movie was shot most of the other kids seemed really quiet and reserved i just turned it on for the producers
3391338 i respect musicians and actors and recognize them for their talents but im just myself around people like that
3391339 obviously we are very proud of him malcolm is so talented and he and his older brother michael added a lot to our school
3391340 hes a really good kid from a really good family
3391341 engineering is a possibility for me my mom says i can build anything
3391342 also i used to write a lot of music and i love the guitar i can feel the guitar strings in my hand and they resonate with me like no other instrument
3391343 my dad arthur is an accomplished musician and i got my love of music from him
3391344 if my son was offered a specific role in a television series or something like that wed consider moving
3391345 but things would have to fall right into place for us to live in hollywood
3391346 i was watching television and said to myself when i am 14 i want to do something in acting
3391347 the 2008 election is providing one of the most compelling political storylines in recent history and the conventions will undoubtedly be among the most important chapters
3391348 our newsmaker breakfast series will provide a fresh perspective from this years cast of political players and give yahoo users a unique peek behind the curtain of americas electoral process
3391349 we wanted to find a way to help colorado residents participate in convention week festivities our breakfast conversations will present an exciting roster of speakers to our readers
3391350 it is hard to imagine more exciting partnerships at a more important time in this historic campaign
3391351 these events will offer politicians and the public access to unique and powerful audiences the local community via the host newspapers political enthusiasts via politico and the world via yahoo news
3391352 just about every election minnesota is at or near the top for voter turnout in the nation so here we have the opportunity to add to the political discussion for a savvy civically engaged populace
3391353 were thrilled to be able to partner with yahoo and politico to do just that
3391354 however we understand that there are some users who prefer not to receive customized advertising and this opt out will offer them even greater choice
3391355 we would be lucky if india achieves a gdp growth of 8 percent as industrial production has suffered heavily
3391356 industry is expectantly looking at the government to move ahead with reforms agenda to give a leg up to industrial growth
3391357 one of my favorite things about our band is that we have always appreciated breaking it down just as much as we love to crank it up the fans have always connected with the acoustic sets and enjoy the acoustic moments at our bigger shows theyve been asking us to do an acoustic record for as long as weve been a band we felt like we were in the perfect space to capture an acoustic evening and it turned out great there are a lot of different sounds and several alternate arrangements that were a blast to play acoustic versions really get their power from musical subtleties the lyricism and the naked harmonies thats where the intimacy really shines

3391360 high def is hot and fios tv is delivered over the network thats built for hd
3391361 our new offer combines the excitement of premium movies with the convenience and advanced technology of our high def dvrs its a great time for people to experience hd the way its meant to be seen with the sharpness and clarity of fios tv
3391362 what makes this promotion compelling is the fact that it focuses on an increasingly popular feature the dvr in a way that will appeal to both late and early adopters of dvrs
3391363 with this offer consumers who have always wanted a dvr can get one for free for 12 months by moving to fios tv and those that already use a dvr can extend that experience throughout their home at no charge for 12 months by signing up for fios tv and its home media dvr service this is a good example of how a service provider can leverage its technological advantages to attract new business

3391370 standard zal sowieso moeten scoren in engeland wil het doorgaan en steven gerrard is onzeker dat is toch al meegenomen
3391371 woensdagavond zal ik wel meteen vragen wat standard gedaan heeft
3391372 een pronostiek nee daar waag ik mij niet aan maar stel je voor standard en marseille in de champions league en dan nog in dezelfde groep dat zou pas iets zijn
3391373 als ik scoor heb ik iets speciaals in petto een doelpunt zou het mooiste moment uit mijn carri re zijn
3391374 of we een gemakkelijke match verwachten in luik zeker niet belgen zijn altijd moeilijke opponenten
3391375 nee in die val trap ik niet wij zijn er niet gerust op of ik spelers van standard ken de mannen die op de spelen speelden ja
3391376 wij kennen geen enkele speler van standard wij willen in luik de kwalificatie al veiligstellen al onderschatten we standard zeker niet
3391377 liverpool zal op standard het spel niet maken benitez rekent op fernando torres om op de counter te spelen

3391394 caution against characterizing either fair or farms by any one particular paper or small group of papers both groups are more in the nature of clearinghouses and involve contributions from literally hundreds of people
3391395 how various materials would be presented in portugal mongolia or a dozen places in africa if one desires church wide materials about dna and kirtland anti banking
3391396 such a view would essentially be very parochial if one has in mind the saints in malta or vanuatu or hong kong
3391397 id like to see something in the current curriculum like nibleys an approach to the book of mormon the 1957 melchizedek priesthood manual now republished by farms i also noted however that i can understand that as a world wide church the curriculum department has a tough balancing act in this area

3391404 what better way to kick off the launch of our new web site than with the help of astronaut extraordinaire buzz aldrin
3391405 those proxies were originally what i was counting on to offline edit the video
3391406 when i got to l a and started loading up the proxies they wouldnt play back in realtime the main problem was it wouldnt play back in final cut so there was no way to offline the footage to get an idea of what shots we wanted to use so that first issue forced me to convert all the footage which means i had to do the first color correction on all the footage before we edited
3391407 once i made it to that conversion to dvcpro everything was smooth sailing
3391408 it was the redcode codec that really screwed me up it just did not play it didnt like other software it crashed other software constantly since i was only using redalert which is the clip by clip software you cant really do sequences i was fairly limited i couldnt watch the footage full frame realtime in that software either so i just had to bite the bullet and just convert all the footage at the start and then kind of work backwards from there
3391409 redalert is reds software for correcting individual clips so you can only do one clip at a time and you can only render out one clip at a time
3391410 so in redalert i would correct my exposure and iso until the shot was consistent with the shot before it and i would take a screen capture of that shot bring it into photoshop thats where i would do my second pass color correction before the thing was even edited and after i got the shot looking the way i wanted i knew that the next 10 12 shots had generally the same tone so id address those 10 12 shots
3391411 then id use redline is built into redalert and it runs through the terminal
3391412 once i started getting quick with that workflow i started doing two three four text files with five to six clips with each and i was running them all at the same time because it was an 8 core processor and then i was running single clips it was even a little bit of processor resource that was being unused so i started trying running eight terminals at once it freaked out i ran five six it freaked out i finally found that three was the best way to go
3391413 a lot of the people are using the redcine and crimson and theres a few other new softwares
3391414 and that stuff works with xml edls that you basically do your offline youre bringing the edl into the software and it actually calls up all the red clips based on the proxy you edited with and then you can do your color correction at once thats probably the smartest way to work but i just i like the individual clip method and i couldnt get redcine to run on my machine at the time you know its very new pretty much still in beta
3391415 i can talk it just feels like some piece of spaghetti cooked spaghetti hanging down the back of my throat its not a big deal
3391416 it could potentially be performed by a health technician rather than a physician where a physician would review the results
3391417 we want to get all the way out to the periphery
3391418 one reason that its still scary is that the clintons are still triangulating
3391419 given our institutions mission of educating those who serve we are proud to offer these accredited online degree programs for educators at an affordable tuition of 825 course
3391420 at our current tuition levels our m ed degree programs can be completed for 9 900 13 200 in tuition with minimal additional fees we hope that this will enable additional qualified individuals to become teachers and advance their careers
3391421 it is truly exciting to be able to launch additional education degrees this fall
3391422 these degrees are particularly important additions giving people the opportunity to earn an advanced degree as well as west virginia teacher certification which has reciprocity with most other states

3391429 las compa as que operan con una licencia en regla rutinariamente exceden las cuotas que se les otorgaron ya que senegal carece de los recursos suficientes para patrullar sus aguas
3391430 las autoridades tambi n tienen problemas para controlar a los barcos que se mueven de una zona pesquera a otra correspondientes a distintas naciones
3391431 los propietarios de los buques de arrastre juegan con las distintas licencias y si no pueden obtener una en senegal la consiguen sin problema en un pa s vecino

3391435 the best of the best were looking at an exceptional level of swimming
3391436 its moving because there is a greater opportunity to race and there is more money in the sport people are investing into thinking about swimming fast
3391437 the suits helps us feel good in the water if you feel good in the water you can do special things
3391438 a big part of sprinting is feel if you dont feel good in the water youre not going to swim well
3391439 where technology is used in sport it is important to be in control
3391440 im not refusing this technology we should control the conditions in which it is developed
3391441 people are faster now but everybody is in the suit so its across the board its not just a few people
3391442 if you look at the pool there is very little movement of the water
3391443 over the last four years ive never seen such a big amount of swimmers especially sprinters compete as much and as regularly against each other
3391444 we hope to develop specialized intense care management methodologies that bring proven results to patients providers and health plans we cant accomplish these goals without exceptional technology icws ten year experience with providing proven ehealth solutions along with their experience with other cardiac care projects makes them the obvious partner for coventrys new program
3391445 the alignment of patient provider and case manager is greatly improved by a truly interoperable technology platform capable of sharing data from a multitude of source systems icw has provided these solutions both within the u s and europe with notable success and looks forward to working closely with coventry as they launch this revolutionary program
3391446 we have always tried to provide nutrition to these patients but what we have not known in the past was that it is very very important to do this early on within the first day or two days after trauma and to do this very aggressively
3391447 its done very easily it doesnt require any magic bullet or any drug or any kind of new technology its just basically putting a feeding tube in and feeding these patients aggressively early on
3391448 i loved her she was beautiful on the inside and outside
3391449 life makes me happy i just love life i love life because look at what life even with all the tragedy that ive gone through look at what its brought me
3391450 there is a great fear that russia and china may oppose the naval and air land blockade of iran if russian and perhaps chinese naval warships escort commercial tankers to iran in violation of the blockade it could be the most dangerous at sea confrontation since the cuban missile crisis
3391451 about 1 200 u s servicemen and 800 georgians will train for three weeks at the vaziani military base near the georgian capital tbilisi
3391452 green berets now in georgia u s special forces are training georgian soldiers to fight radical muslims the mission could benefit other u s interests as well
3391453 the advantage of this technology is that it allows you to look at the molecular disposition the placement of molecules and thats critical in disease
3391454 for example if you wanted to look at the edge of a tumor one of the things that you want to know is that edge rapidly growing is it an aggressive edge or is it somewhat dormant or is the tumor not going to grow
3391455 the effort here has been how do we get these kinds of fantastic discoveries at the molecular level that occur at the basic science research labs now into the clinical arena and eventually to the bedside
3391456 the lasers bounce energy into the tissues to bounce molecules out and thats how we measure these
3391457 its an exciting new technology but its not just for gear heads this will make a major difference in how we diagnose and prognose disease
3391458 the disposition of molecules varies greatly and its very difficult to see this if not impossible to see this in some of the normal histological tests that are done
3391459 the challenge then is to work with the clinicians and the pathologists who will look at that piece of tissue and say look i think this area of the tissue looks compromised in some way but from a microscope thats all you can really say the technology that were developing then goes into these areas uses the art and practice of the pathologist to now look at the molecular makeup of those areas of the tissue and now were able to say yes that is a very aggressive molecular pattern or not
3391460 you can look at the genomic information as a type of blueprint for cells but what is actually built what actually makes us up as human beings is different in every single person
3391461 and so that genetic component directs molecules to be made but we really need to know what actually is made because not all of them are made at any one given time they change in time and they change in space
3391462 we were working with the and there were some collaborators there who got a sample from sweden from a lady who died of a disease and the biopsy was taken 109 years go and it was sitting in a preservative for this 109 years and we were able then to use our technology to discover what the disease was
3391463 it shows you the robustness of the molecular makeup of tissue and how modern technology can pull these mysteries apart and lead us to understanding what the disease of a particular patient is
3391464 they go back many many years biopsies that were taken many years ago and most importantly the outcome of the patient is known so this gives us the opportunity then to look at the molecular makeup of that disease and that biopsy and then know what happened to the patient
3391465 the value that this multiplexed imaging brings is that each imaging modality brings a new view and when you put them together then you get a whole leap in understanding
3391466 for example the technology that were developing can take molecular pictures and insert them into mri images and so where theres an aberration in am mri image it may not be clear what the molecular counterpart of it is we can then put that in the image and so it really brings a whole new dimension to imaging to mix these different modalities
3391467 many years ago for example lasers were research tools and now we have them in our players at home we have them in almost every electronic device that we buy says caprioli
3391468 these things become routine and i think instruments like this will be routine in clinical analysis in a very short period of time
3391469 we dont have to come up with whole new technologies and novel methods of doing these sorts of things we can produce energy and reduce our
3391470 we found that biogas energy can produce about 2 5 percent of all the electricity consumed in the u s which is significant and that we can displace about four percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector
3391471 what we could do is take this manure which right now is an environmental liability and turn it into a commodity this is very appealing for agricultural operations its feasible its been done in other countries we could do it here
3391472 overall you get a net effect of saving over 100 million metric tons of greenhouse gases per year if were able to get all that manure and put it into action as an energy source
3391473 ethanol production or even biodiesel production uses a food source and this has caused problems worldwide particularly for the food shortages were seeing this year
3391474 is how feasible this might be but it looks very feasible for these concentrated animal feeding operations where you have a lot of manure in one place anyway
3391475 it does cost some money however you have to buy the equipment but in an era of high electricity prices and high gas prices this becomes more economical than ever before
3391476 people often ask is this new technology or is it expensive its not new technology its been demonstrated for decades in countries like germany its an age old process people have known about it for a long time
3391477 were trying to find ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and we often think of difficult long term multi decade high technology solutions but it turns out the solution might be laying on the ground around us
3391478 maybe obese people can become normal in their sugars without necessarily losing the weight
3391479 obviously losing weight is the optimum way to go but maybe along the way while theyre working towards that goal we can help with a little bit of these natural remedies
3391480 we noticed a very significant drop in their blood sugars so basically after two weeks of consuming curcumin orally their diabetes was essentially gone
3391481 doctors have known for a very very long time that theres a negative impact of being overweight and actually underweight on a womans reproductive capability and in the recent years with ivf in vitro fertilization being very very prevalent studies have come out that show that women who seem to be very very good on paper dont do as well as we would expect with regard to the number of eggs that we may retrieve from them or their ability to become pregnant with ivf techniques if theyre overweight so ive always been very interested about trying to discern why women who are overweight have difficulty becoming pregnant and my interest in that sort of brought me into the diabetes and obesity center here
3391482 there are scientific studies that have shown that have been done of various degrees of rigor that show that turmeric and curcumin really do have significant benefits in inflammatory conditions
3391483 manchester united made an offer for david silva but this has been turned down by valencia
3391484 silva doesnt want to play in england because he is happy at valencia
3391485 his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like real madrid or barcelona david silva will start the new season at valencia
3391486 baxter has a talent to define the game which is important
3391487 he can make the moment that matters that wins you a game whether it be a through pass a goal a dribble whatever it may be
3391488 he has that talent in him that is something you cannot give a player it is just inside them you have to nurture it and bring it out of him so he can perform at the highest level
3391489 it might be a little earlier for him at the moment it is wrong to compare him with wayne rooney wayne was a man physically when he was 16 he was strong and very advanced
3391490 we need to make sure we are careful with him
3391491 jose is a young boy who has been doing all the training the older lads have been doing we have got to make sure we look after him just now but he could quite easily be in the side on merit

3391505 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3391506 34 of u s adults aged 20 and over are obese part of the rise in this disease may be attributed to our surroundings for example increased accessibility to unhealthy foods the built environment is also creating barriers for our ability to exercise many neighborhood areas lack parks and other recreational facilities and suburbs are often designed to discourage neighborhood walking simply focusing on encouraging people to change their lifestyles to eat better and to get more exercise is insufficient measures are also needed to improve features of the built environment which are often modifiable e g via changes in city zoning development policies to support people in making such changes
3391507 the use of chili peppers as a spice has spread to nearly every culture within 20 degrees of the equator and it tends to decline as you move toward the poles
3391508 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3391509 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3391510 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3391511 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3391512 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3391513 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3391514 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3391515 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3391516 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3391517 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3391518 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3391519 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3391520 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3391521 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3391522 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3391523 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3391524 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3391525 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3391526 i should be there by now did i make the wrong turn
3391527 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3391528 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3391529 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3391530 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3391531 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3391532 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3391533 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3391534 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3391535 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
3391536 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
3391537 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
3391538 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
3391539 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3391540 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3391541 we know from many clinical studies of patients and their families that our cells can tolerate a rather large amount of mutant mitochondrial dna with no significant loss of function
3391542 these new clinical measurements have given direct evidence for the widespread incidence of pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations in the human population these findings emphasize the pressing need to develop effective ways to interrupt the transmission of these mutations to the next generation
3391543 in our last race at michigan international speedway our ford was one of the fastest cars in the race
3391544 at the end of the race had the caution flag not come out i thought we had something for race winner dale earnhardt junior

3391551 thank you so much for all your research we know you went above and beyond for us and really appreciate the thousands you saved us
3391552 but its o k with me if our timing wasnt perfect after several years of reporting on the housing market im convinced that the most common real estate mistake is viewing a house first as a financial investment and only second as a home thats one big reason we ended up in this bubble induced mess most of the time the decision whether to rent or buy should be based above all on life circumstances do you expect to move again in a couple years or is there a good chance that youre ready to settle in and stop worrying about real estate for a while
3391553 we would still hold to the time frame of within a year from may and all things considered there should be no issues with that

3391582 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
3391583 with pay pressure still subdued mounting job insecurity is being compounded by a significant squeeze on workers real incomes but the absence of any sign of an emerging wage price spiral at least offers greater hope that the bank of england might soon be able to cut interest rates to head off the threat of recession
3391584 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
3391585 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient

3391595 rural northumberland has the most sparsely populated areas in england and we believe post office closures would have a significant impact upon our communities
3391596 we remain concerned that the time the post office has allowed for consultation is too short to allow communities to respond fully and for alternative proposals to be considered appropriately
3391597 the county council has registered its concerns with the post office about possible closures in support of the communities potentially affected the elderly and those with young families who are least able to adjust to the proposed changes
3391598 we are urging post office ltd to recognise the special circumstances in northumberland and continue to work with us and our communities to consider alternative options

3391636 a further reason for the greater popularity of little nemo is its emphasis on optical effect rather than actual content it is well known that the human brain is much faster in taking in optical impressions than it is in absorbing texts and plots we are all aware of this phenomenon in our modern society a film based on a book is nearly always more popular than the book itself and a hit single does not sell at all without a cool video clip accompanying it

3391669 to put it bluntly in many professions service as an expert witness is not considered honest work
3391670 the contempt of lawyers and judges for experts is famous they regularly describe expert witnesses as prostitutes

3391720 later a spokesman for the georgian interior ministry told the bbc that there had never been russian troops in gori you
3391721 now we find out that she is exempting hometown companies from minimum wage this is exactly the hypocrisy and double talk that we have come to expect from the democrats
3391722 ning n representante de la comisi n les ha trasladado esa demanda
3391723 i am already roasted on one side and if thou wouldst have me well cooked it is time to turn me on the other
3391724 oha ok gehn wir auf die wiese wenn du nicht mehr kannst trag ich dich ein st ckchen
3391725 na wieder fit mein schatz komm gehen wir wieder nach hause
3391726 so kleine fleckchen die sind nicht schlimm da hat wahrscheinlich nur ein grashalm ein kleine gef angekratzt
3391727 well its interesting to hear senator mccain talk about bringing congress back he wasnt even in congress this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy one to give tax credit for wind solar and other renewable resources and another about hybrid cars and the rest so he wasnt in to vote when were in session and now hes saying call it back in
3391728 and then one of the others said to the president call congress back in and the president said no the president said no but the point is this the point is this the american people are suffering we have to do what is best for them
3391729 the fastest way to do this is in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the strategic petroleum reserve
3391730 number two they want to drill if they want to drill we have 68 million acres in the lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest
3391731 four renew invest in renewable energy resources which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore which will take 10 years and produce two cents reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump
3391732 and then use natural gas natural gas is so plentiful its better for the environment and it is cheaper
3391733 and we have voted on this over and over again but the republicans and the president have resisted instead they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them
3391734 would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling
3391735 it depends how that is proposed if the safeguards are there now mind you 68 million acres 10 million more acres in alaska where they can drill
3391736 if we can get some great things in terms of renewable energy resources a renewable electricity standard wind solar biofuels and the rest in that context because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming
3391737 the consumer is our first responsibility the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore by the way let me make this one final point this oil is owned by the american taxpayers the oil companies drill we give them money to drill there but we get very little in return
3391738 so i think as we have this debate which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil big oils profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer
3391739 when we have this vote when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the american people i mean do you know what exxon mobil their last quarter their profits were historic last year they were historic they outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter and they insist that we pay them to drill they need an incentive to drill in order to make over 11 billion in one quarter and it just doesnt make sense we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources tax credit for wind and solar etc and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest instead of giving big oil more profits
3391740 i will not subscribe to a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore youre going to bring down the price at the pump even the president says thats not true
3391741 ten years two cents were saying 10 days bring down the price if the president would free our oil from the strategic petroleum from our stockpile owned by the taxpayers purchased by the taxpayers
3391742 i know that we will strengthen our majorities increase their numbers and we will have a democratic president in the white house and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation energy security and global warming

3391766 people who have been through an atomic bombing feel responsible to warn others about what will happen if the nonproliferation treaty is not enforced
3391767 if we forget what has happened its going to get worse there is a loss of memory happening in our culture people are so distracted by stress and the fast pace they forget
3391768 it is a memory of our culture that we dropped two bombs that obliterated two cities of people
3391769 while we offer at the priory a place of peace we want to offer a place of reflection of memory
3391770 what have we learned we have it in our hands to destroy with nuclear weapons the lives of others and our own lives
3391771 but unless we wake up the nightmare will continue with deadly consequences
3391772 there are real issues some so critical for the life of people on this planet and the planet itself
3391773 we have as human beings within our power the capacity to destroy the planet and one another thats a different consciousness than i had as a child in 1940 humans have the power to destroy life as we know it
3391774 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3391775 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3391776 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3391777 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself

3391780 page where i find that the same not upgraded version is noted
3391781 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3391782 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3391783 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3391784 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3391785 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3391786 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3391787 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3391788 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3391789 i am proud to have been chosen to sing at all
3391790 nobody else has got enough guts to run against a sitting judge
3391791 ive had problems with my issues with him since i first started the first year i was here
3391792 ive never had a fight with him or anything ive spoken to him personally about some of the problems but ive never expected things to come up again the other problems to him not being known as somebody who treats individuals with dignity and respect
3391793 courtroom attendance is the most important part of a judges work you have to be there day in and day out and preparation is so important too
3391794 if theres an increase in probation caseloads then our ability to monitor and counsel juveniles goes down and over the long term detention increases
3391795 as professionals were not going to measure our value according to how much money we make we measure it according to the benefit we confer upon those in the court for me the highest calling of a lawyer is to be a judge
3391796 touching individual lives in a way that did not happen in my practice at the attorney generals office
3391797 i spoke to coach gerets about my prospects this season and we agreed i will benefit more if i took the lorient offer
3391798 marseille signed many experienced players for this season and will limit my playing time which is not enough for me
3391799 with more playing time at lorient i can continue my development and gain the experience to return stronger to marseille

3391806 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3391807 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3391808 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3391809 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker
3391810 this war has pushed georgia further away from europe we cannot create an anti russia coalition in europe and on this point we are close to putins position
3391811 define a powerful inspirational statement that simply and concisely states the core concepts of the association and encapsulates those concepts in the fewest words possible
3391812 it was the consensus of our committee that we have the order right
3391813 the issue is whether the american bar association from this day forward will define itself as a trade association or as a noble profession whether its changing its highest priority from serving the people we are bound to serve or serving our own interests
3391814 the proposed statement will tell the world that the goals lead off with serving ourselves
3391815 unless and until we are a member driven organization we cant succeed in any of the objectives we set for ourselves
3391816 were making a statement to the lawyers of america to the public and to the courts we need to give people a reason to join this association
3391817 our members are the soul of this association our members are those who we are bound to serve without them we have nothing to say in washington for this body to vote that our members should be last would send an awful signal to our current members and the many lawyers in america who are not yet members
3391818 politics must play no role in either the hiring of career department of justice employees or the investigation and prosecution of cases
3391819 i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3391820 professionalism is alive and well at the department of justice today
3391821 we have decided to quit cis and to say farewell to the soviet union we call on ukraine and other members to also quit the cis ruled by russia
3391822 we have also decided to renounce the russian peacekeepers mandate and to declare abkhazia and south ossetia occupied territories of georgia

3391831 dat haalt de essentie weg van waar muziek over gaat
3391832 muziek maken gaat over mensen raken echt raken dan kun je het ook soulmuziek noemen dat heeft niets te maken met een genre maar met de inhoud en het gevoel
3391833 ik doe gewoon wat ik graag wil en dat is muziek maken misschien past die missie daar wel in omdat mijn teksten gaan over het echte leven en niet alleen over populaire dingen
3391834 ik draag dat altijd bij me ik bid voor goede dingen en ik probeer op het juiste pad te blijven

3391844 against the backdrop of an expanding market opportunity we believe that our leadership position in multiple vertical markets will continue to drive growth and record performance
3391845 we felt the team needed new drive and aabrekk can give us that
3391846 we will need to raise our game a lot to have any chance against marseille but we still have an outside chance of going through
3391847 this is a very difficult task but a big chance as well we can give ourselves a boost for the whole season i am very optimistic that we will prevail
3391848 atl tico have a good team and we have to try to get a good result in our home match
3391849 we know were coming up against a very strong team
3391850 from what weve seen and heard schalke when playing at home are solid secure and they attack a lot we must be organised and sensible while looking to profit from whatever chances we manage to create if we can take a slight advantage going into the second leg we know that in front of our own supporters we can finish off the job
3391851 everybody knows we havent been in the uefa champions league for a very long time so we dont want to let this opportunity pass us by

3391854 everyone i know in england is convinced that arsenal will go through so there is no pressure on our players
3391855 we have to go into the match relaxed with the belief we can we win but also enjoy it because its arsenal its the uefa champions league for the first time in the clubs history so it is a momentous occasion
3391856 do not get the chance to play against arsenal every day
3391857 a good performance first and foremost thats what i want to see
3391858 you never know and we want to make sure we go to london in a fortnight still in the tie
3391859 arsenal always want to play in the uefa champions league and i think arsenal need to play in the uefa champions league
3391860 if you have good players and a big stadium then i think you need to play at the highest league in europe

3391936 andrew is absolutely thrilled with his debut album but it is a huge personal blow to him that prince has declined the use of purple rain
3391937 it is disappointing that the track that got him signed and was loved by the record company could jeopardise the album release so it had to be removed

3392031 last year we had a bad time at brno i could only finish seventh and it was quite disheartening this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win and with our bike and tyres working very well ive had a good summer break just relaxing with my friends and family but now i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again and were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice in order not to lose any time in finding out the right set up for our bike we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna seca
3392032 i am going to brno with a high hopes and above all trying not to think about the disappointment of laguna seca its behind me now in the usa i was fast once again and i hope that i can carry on like this in the czech republic i know that i can brno is a circuit that i like a lot its one of my favourites ive won there three times in 125cc and 250cc its a good place for my riding style and the weather is normally perfect physically i feel very good after the crash and the injuries i definitely feel as good as could be expected its the first time this season that ive really had proper time to recover thanks to the holidays so i think i am in good shape at the moment i am still using my crutches to walk but i have been able to do some training and i know that i wont have a problem when i arrive in brno on thursday
3392033 brno will be the start of a very important run of seven rounds to the end of the season with 25 points on stoner and 41 on pedrosa we are in a good position but we have to manage this advantage in the remaining races it will be an exciting end to the season with pedrosa back in the fight and lorenzo i am sure able to re join the podium club last year at most of these final circuits we werent able to fight at the top but we are working hard now to be able to provide valentino with the most competitive package to allow him to race at the front as he has for the majority of this years races every race from now on will be very important and brno could be one of the most difficult for us against our competitors we have to use all of our potential and work at 100 in all of the practices everybody in yamaha is extremely motivated and we cant wait to be back in the battle especially after the exciting laguna seca show
3392034 from talking to jorge it seems that he is feeling much better he is back in training and we are expecting him to be as fit as he could be in the circumstances the crash was a huge disappointment but at least he has had the maximum time to get over it and we know that he will have made the most of the break in brno the first aim for jorge is to get back the feeling and confidence that he had at the start of the season so that he can enjoy the remaining races we need to rebuild his confidence in the bike in practice at laguna he was looking good he was fast and qualified fourth then on the day we had some rear grip issues and the crash was very unfortunate rear grip is now the biggest thing we have to work on improving on the bike we need to work together with michelin to improve this the new surface also adds an unknown quantity to this race and so tyre choice is going to be especially important the team is very motivated and looking forward to getting back to work were hoping for a good race jorge certainly deserves one
3392035 manchester united made an offer for david silva but this has been turned down by valencia
3392036 silva doesnt want to play in england because he is happy at valencia
3392037 his family are settled and if he was to move it would only be to another spanish club like real madrid or barcelona
3392038 i can say that david silva wants to play in spain next season
3392039 i dont know where he will play it could be valencia but it will be for a team here in spain he doesnt want to play in another country at the moment

3392068 there follows a lunch with the authors witty agent at the ivy and it can sometimes come as a bit of a hangover for the author to remember that this tremendously commercial premise has to be slogged into a book if a writer suffers a block after banking the cheque its not unreasonable for publishers or film companies to want their money back in due course
3392069 for show buffs this will be a treasure trove i say that with no immodesty
3392070 true buffs love nothing more than demos out of print and private recordings particularly of cut songs and especially when sung by the composer this compendium has all of the above and more due to the enthusiasm and diligence of didier deutsch and archivist peter e jones although i am listed as co producer of this set all the work and choices were theirs on behalf of all us musical theater fanatics i thank them both not to mention sony bmg who have packaged these buried and not so buried nuggets with such care and lavish elegance

3392078 its still well behind facebook and myspace which are in a heated battle for top spot but has been helped by myspaces difficulty in launching myspace music which is supposed to offer tracks from major label artists
3392079 its not the social networking its not the add inspired interface its not the wide range of opportunities for personal expression its simply that you can find almost any song on imeem

3392095 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3392096 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
3392097 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
3392098 we are working with the uk bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
3392099 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
3392100 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
3392101 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk
3392102 significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties
3392103 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3392104 theres evidence that the bus may have suffered tire tread separation
3392105 the drivers side front tire looked like it went through a meat grinder
3392106 the wheel and the remnants of the tire are still intact on the bus so it looks like something deteriorated in the tire
3392107 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3392108 i know it was just hydroplaning because the road was so wet i dont know if it was going too fast we came all the way around facing the other way and when it hit that median it rolled over
3392109 they were saying help me and that was the worst part of it for me we couldnt do anything
3392110 all inside the bus was nothing but mud and blood
3392111 its a tragedy thats the only thing i can call it the world is a much crueler place
3392112 when it happened i kind of had a bad feeling when i didnt hear from her
3392113 she would have called to let me know she was all right
3392114 loved her kids she loved god and she loved to teach
3392115 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3392116 i couldnt believe a truck of that size going off the bridge especially a large truck like that
3392117 i drive a truck and i deliver on this side of the bridge my main work is on that side of the bridge so it worries me
3392118 it makes me anxious because i never thought about anybody going over the bridge but now with it happening it is definitely on your mind
3392119 i dont have a problem with driving on the bridge in fact i enjoy it its a nice way to come home but i fell asleep on it just before i hit the wall and seeing that truck go through it is pretty worrisome
3392120 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3392121 such tragedies are becoming all too common and many of these deadly accidents are preventable
3392122 it certainly would appear to me theres reason to believe that seatbelts wouldve saved lives in this particular tragedy
3392123 in connection with motor carrier operations pose an imminent hazard to the public
3392124 now the whole world knows so i think that god used this tragedy to strengthen our faith i truly believe that
3392125 high commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices but rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers particularly in africa
3392126 people just cannot afford fertiliser they were in dire straits before but now the situation is worse
3392127 strong global demand for fertilisers is stretching current production capacity to its technical limits this situation will persist until new capacity comes on line
3392128 it can take 5 7 years to open a phosphate mine 10 years for a potash mine and three years for a major nitrogen plant

3392141 as we looked at the plan we had for september 2013 against the available dollars it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules
3392142 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion
3392143 this new plan september 2014 aligns our schedule to what we forecast will be the available resources we are slowing down the work to match and stay under our available funding and to do that we had to go to a later date
3392144 its the unknown unknowns that we have to hedge against having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment in addition to having some number of months of cost dollars flexibility is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture

3392154 this is a charge that he made the contribution intending to influence and reward the official for the performance of official duties should the public officials assistance be needed on any potential problems on the mississippi beef project
3392155 carwood told the employees that they would be reimbursed for these contributions through bonuses to their salaries

3392170 weve received so many e mails and requests over the years to bring our show to germany and to finally perform there in such a prominent and prestigious way is very special to us were really looking forward to exposing german audiences to our very unique presentation which will include many special guests from around the world
3392171 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3392172 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city
3392173 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3392174 we did our best to create a rendering that would look like the shot was taken live
3392175 hate to tell you but web 1 0 was social too
3392176 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3392177 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3392178 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3392179 these are the kinds of things you see in e mails that you see circulating about obama in this sort of subterranean smear campaign against him you never see these things voiced by the candidates
3392180 had sen clinton followed mark penns advice it would have caused her more angst than good
3392181 whats going on right now is that a lot of obama supporters and fundraisers are trying very hard to retire sen clintons debt one reason theyve had difficulty doing so is the dislike among obama people for mark penn specifically
3392182 they tend to blame him for the nature of these negative attacks
3392183 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3392184 this was a historic campaign people thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall and instead weve had this historic presidential election where shes collapsed and a first term senator has won the democratic nomination
3392185 so i think its just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated and theres certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened
3392186 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3392187 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3392188 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3392189 this takes restraining order madness to a whole new level
3392190 it felt good to get out there and just start banging heads with other people
3392191 at the least i saw a guy who was getting upfield and getting after the passer

3392206 i hope my uncle and i can go to the memphis game i know that is the first game at ole miss and it will be crazy i plan on going i still talk to

3392211 there is simply no way that we can balance the budget before the end of the year without laying off city employees
3392212 services to our community and those that need it most
3392213 they have to balance their budgets and theyre doing it on the backs of the citizens
3392214 it is a very sad day in the city of duluth
3392215 city employees are the lifeblood of our organization and this action will be a terrible blow to the organization
3392216 we have been working almost nonstop for seven months trying to find a way to avoid this very situation
3392217 unfortunately the vast majority of city costs are personnel costs and it is apparent that we can not balance the budget without layoffs thats a reality that breaks my heart
3392218 oh do you think that is the case we eventually were served but i still dont know the truth my friend appeared to choose a different excuse i guess that was for her own survival but it is very sad this still goes on maybe not as often as in the 60s but it happens and it is unfair

3392227 i am loyal to those brands that respect me talk to me and listen to me they get me i buy them
3392228 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3392229 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3392230 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3392231 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3392232 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3392233 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3392234 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3392235 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3392236 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3392251 things that are dimensional like the dragon lunging at the camera in blu ray really knock your head off because you are seeing all the details we put in it that are even a little better defined
3392252 the dark light values are better so you can be darker and still see all the detail plus you have many more layers of ancillary material and much more information

3392260 the complexity of newly engineered systems coupled with their potential impact on lives the environment etc raise a set of ethical issues that engineers had not been thinking about
3392261 we need at least to think about what we are doing while we are doing it to be aware of the consequences of our research
3392262 it leaves the door open for people to do something that is going to cause long term problems
3392263 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3392264 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3392265 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3392266 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3392267 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3392268 have a conversation with the proprietor who tends to be of a type perhaps a bit crusty but highly knowledgeable and independent minded at his office he lives amidst this history he is surrounded by the truth about money that most people never discover he is daily faced with the beauty of what once was and perhaps too he imagines the possibility that it could be again he is not usually the despairing type either he sees the difference between what is permanent and what is transitory if you take the time you can learn from him
3392269 i would say that without getting the business background it would have been fairly impossible to take an invention anywhere
3392270 so what we had to do is start teaching entrepreneurship to engineers
3392271 not so long ago if an engineer had a small invention he would just hope that there would be someone on business side that would recognize brilliance and see the application
3392272 most of the time it would have died right there
3392273 to help develop and motivate the next generation of energy entrepreneurs
3392274 what we try to do in terms of the course is to give them the sense that there is a structure in place for how to present your ideas
3392275 we give them a framework for how to approach business situations
3392276 ability to analyze problems in a different way by focusing on a need in the market and working backwards to an invention
3392277 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid

3392283 the fact that senator obama did not have a very coherent answer made things worse for charles gibson since obama can do no wrong in the eyes of many of his supporters they resented gibsons having asked him such a question
3392284 the elitist sneers at people who believe in religion and who own guns the americans who dont speak foreign languages and the views of the typical white person are all like rays of light that show through the cracks in obamas carefully crafted image

3392298 in a very challenging retail environment we delivered strong sales merchandise margins and profit increases on top of very strong operating results last year
3392299 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3392300 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3392301 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3392302 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3392303 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3392304 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink

3392309 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment
3392310 i am reassured after our talks that there will be more people going through the pavilions
3392311 we will be in contact with the sponsors and i hope they will be satisfied
3392312 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3392313 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high was well above expectations
3392314 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3392315 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3392316 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3392317 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3392318 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3392319 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective

3392326 structure is highly conserved capturing information that is evolutionarily deep
3392327 it was only logical to focus on transfer rna a molecule that is believed to be very ancient and is truly central to the entire protein synthesis machinery
3392328 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
3392329 for the first time we believe we make this distinction between the evolution of the genetic code codon discovery and the evolution of amino acid charging
3392330 in conclusion this study demonstrates that patients with early stage breast cancer who are disease free at five years after adjuvant systemic therapy have a substantially increased residual risk of recurrence
3392331 contrary to our predictions based on shorter follow up the absolute difference in cumulative incidence of distant metastasis and prostate cancer death did not further increase after 7 years of follow up
3392332 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3392333 these results demonstrate that among men younger than 65 years whose prostate cancer is detected by methods other than psa testing eg due to a digital rectal examination to evaluate uri nary or other symptoms cure with radical prostatectomy is possi ble may be necessary and should generally be recommended
3392334 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3392335 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3392336 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean
3392337 ug99 first occurred in uganda in 1999 its now in iran and closing in on asia
3392338 most crops in asias major wheat growing areas are vulnerable to ug99 so if it gets to these areas food shortages and famine could result ug99 could also pose a bio security threat to australia
3392339 wheat varieties worldwide including those in australia rely on only a few rust resistance genes to protect them from different strains of rust but most of these resistance genes provide little protection against ug99 and derived strains
3392340 the challenge is to now identify and deploy more multiple resistance gene combinations that protect wheat against ug99 or find other ways to protect wheat from this fungus
3392341 participating in a co ordinated international consortium is the best way to find solutions to this potential global threat
3392342 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3392343 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible

3392345 who are at an increased risk for liver disease progression and would therefore potentially benefit from early interventions such as reg ular screening to detect disease progression and treatment
3392346 one of the main challenges is to determine whether secondary prevention can be accomplished with new antiviral therapies for hbv infection
3392347 the overall effect sizes that we are reporting for all classes of drugs are small
3392348 the potential implications for current practice and future research should be tempered as a result of this finding
3392349 to our knowledge this is the first report to show that doxorubicin and zoledronic acid inhibit subcutaneous breast tumor growth in vivo in a treatment sequence specific fashion and in the absence of tumor induced bone disease
3392350 our data suggest that there may be benefits of combining zoledronic acid with cytotoxic agents for the treatment of patients with early stage breast cancer
3392351 our data indicate that the increase in adenocarcinoma is real and a growing health problem for both white men and women
3392352 we have information to suggest that the fire alarm did operate at 1 35am on the morning of the fire
3392353 when our officers arrived the fire was already well developed which suggests that it had started some time before we got there
3392354 there was a rapid fire spread which indicates that products of combustion in the building may have been leaking into the area
3392355 the fire could have been slow burning for some time if there was a limited supply of oxygen
3392356 often the contacts are keyholders they usually check whether its a false alarm before alerting the fire services
3392357 i am not prepared to speculate about anything ahead of the publication of the official report into the cause of the fire
3392358 i have every confidence in the investigation being carried out jointly between the police the fire service and insurers and i am sure we will all know exactly what happened in due course
3392359 i urge everyone to avoid speculation as it only causes further distress to those involved
3392360 the police arent involved with the investigations as the fire service have not yet decided whether its suspicious
3392361 is not in a position to make an informed determination as to whether the allegations have any merit

3392380 from the customers perspective they will have only one support contact which is our noc and only one bill so they dont have to call two separate people to resolve some issue
3392381 for megapath it is a value added service to our customers at this point it is something that we offer in addition to our mpls vpn service we are looking at how else we can offer this outside of that mpls vpn because there is no reason we couldnt offer it as an add on to a single site internet connection for smaller retailers

3392428 saya melihatnya ini sebuah kerjaan mafia berkedok seakan akan mau melakukan sesuatu supaya harga pasar di dunia tidak dimainkan pihak pembeli sebetulnya di balik itu mau menguasai semua pengusaha penguasaha di bangka belitung
3392429 saya akan membuka kasus ini ke dpr bahkan kalau perlu dewan harus membuat semacam tim investigasi untuk mengungkap lebih dalam lagi adanya pelanggaran pelanggaran hukum yang terjadi di sana
3392430 indikasi pelanggaran hukum yang saya temukan adanya unsur pencurian timah yang dilakukan melalui dengan apa yang disebut merambah wilayah lain atau sebenarnya milik orang lain saya sedang kumpulkan data data pelanggaran hukum ini karena menurut dugaan saya sudah dilakukan sejak lama
3392431 karena kondisinya tanahnya benar benar kering tanpa ada sumber air maka untuk ditanami palawija saja rasanya tidak mungkin
3392432 karena kekurangan air keseluruhan hasil panen baik dari sawah yang kekeringan atau tidak turun sekitar 50 persen dibanding saat musim penghujan
3392433 namun upaya itu pun terbukti tidak berhasil karena sebagian besar justru mati karena kekurangan air
3392434 namun karena kekurangan air semua tanaman itu tidak dapat tumbuh optimal dan sama sekali tidak menghasilkan buah
3392435 masa depan man city tidak dalam ancaman dalam waktu dekat bisnis berjalan seperti biasanya kami juga tak terlalu tergantung kepada uang thaksin shinawatra

3392444 kemarin yang kita hentikan itu sebanyak 9 3 juta ton karena harganya terlalu rendah sejak juli sampai harga naik harga mereka itu kan long term contract rata rata 34 per ton per dollar as
3392445 memang negosiasi harga sedang berlangsung karena belum ada index yang kita tetapkan kita pakai ici per juli kemarin untuk semua jenis batubara kalau sesuai ici saat ini sebesar 126 dollar as per ton
3392446 sudah ada perusahaan yang setuju untuk negosiasi ulang yah kalau nama perusahaan belum bisa kita ungkap
3392447 penutupan itu kan dilakukan oleh bupati seharusnya ia berkoordinasi dulu dengan kementerian atau setidaknya buatlah surat dulu pada menteri esdm
3392448 jadi tidak bisa asal tutup bupati kan bertindak sesuai surat inspektorat jenderal mestinya yang bertindak itu menteri karena dialah yang berjanji
3392449 itu kan dispute perdebatan antara tanah itu hph hak penguasaan hutan atau htl hutan tanam lindung saat ini kita mau mengambil keputusan harus ditimbang dulu kalau kpc ditutup suplai ke jati b akan terhenti lalu siapa yang salah
3392450 untuk kpc kami kirim tim obvitnas untuk investigasi dan hari ini mereka akan lapor ke menteri esdm hasil ini akan ditindaklanjuti untuk koordinasi dengan polri rencananya hari ini menteri esdm akan berkoordinasi dengan kapolri untuk mencari solusi yang elegan
3392451 kalau sekarang memang belum ada pengaruhnya tapi untuk suplai per tahun sebesar dua juta ton saya pikir bisa terpenuhi
3392452 kami akan menegaskan status thaksin di inggris dan kenapa dia meninggalkan thailand dalam hubungannya dengan kasus hukumnya aturan kami sangat jelas seseorang setiap orang yang terlibat premier league harus lulus fit and proper test jika ada seseorang yang tak bisa melewati tes itu maka dia tak boleh terlibat dalam premier league
3392453 kami harus memastikan jika ada sesorang yang terbukti melakukan kesalahan hukum maka kami juga akan bertindak
3392454 bukannya saya menolak usulan itu seragam koruptor tapi saya punya pendapat sendiri kalau di tahanan silakan diberi seragam koruptor tapi kalau di pengadilan kan selama ini ada ketentuan bahwa mereka terdakwa harus hadir di persidangan dengan rapi
3392455 a drop in consumer activity related to the decline in consumer confidence compared to the corresponding period in 2007
3392456 clearly show that the efficiency improvement measures we introduced at the beginning of the year are producing gains and have helped mitigate the downward pressure on sales stemming from the current slowdown in the economy
3392457 kebetulan saat siang tadi kami sudah melakukan pertemuan salah satunya untuk membahas masalah pemberian bonus bagi atlet indonesia yang meraih medali di olimpiade beijing ini
3392458 yang jelas kami sudah tetapkan bahwa peraih medali perunggu akan menerima hadiah rp150 juta sedang untuk atlet yang meraih medali perak akan menerima dua kali dari peraih medali perunggu
3392459 karena itulah kami terus memotivasi atlet yang sedang bertanding di arena olimpiade ini untuk mengeluarkan kemampuannya semaksimal mungkin agar bisa meraih prestasi yang kita inginkan
3392460 saya berharap kepada suryo dan dedeh agar bisa tampil maksimal meski peluang meraih medali sangat berat namun sudah kita tekankan bahwa target atletik adalah memperbaiki catatan waktu terbaik yang selama ini sudah dibuat
3392461 bicara peluang bagi sandow kami pesimis mengingat ia saat ini berada di posisi 30 besar namun untuk itu kami berharap kepadanya untuk bisa memperbaiki angkatan terbaiknya yang sudah dibuatnya selama ini
3392462 kami tetap berkeyakinan pada tunggal putri kita yakni maria kristin dan sony dwi kuncoro dan pemain lain yang tampil di nomor ganda putra dan campuran
3392463 edi malah mengangkat barbel terlalu condong ke depan pada kesempatan ketiga

3392478 we are looking at a cold cold winter in upstate new york
3392479 george bush and big oil special interests killed this responsible drilling bill because they werent satisfied with their record profits
3392480 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3392481 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3392482 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3392483 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker

3392492 but for yadav maybe that was quite a few major changes and unfortunately when he was admitted to auburn south primary school due to his language skills they requested that he switch to another school so it was another change for him
3392493 that maybe added to the whole frustration for him being only a child
3392494 we really want to thank them she was very lucky
3392495 evidently her body shut down from an imbalance of fluids and because of the temperature
3392496 they had to put her into an induced coma and as there are not many medical facilities and they got a helicopter to fly her out to a medical ship off port moresby
3392497 cornelia would be shattered with her friend going down seriously ill she stayed on the walk with the others as they wouldnt let her go in the helicopter
3392498 as far as i know they have brought her out of the induced coma and she is travelling well
3392499 this new laptop is a real beast with a configuration that tops quite a few desktop workstations
3392500 lenovo is doing a great job of paying attention to what unique customer segments really need and desire this system is aimed squarely at multimedia professionals and lenovo has designed a system that gives them pretty much everything on their wish list from a high end quad core processor to 8gb memory high end discrete video cards and dual hard drives with a blu ray burner to boot
3392501 the built in digitizer and color calibrator will appeal to the professionals but the rest of the system i think will prove tempting to a wider audience
3392502 this system will certainly get the attention of the prosumer crowd which are consumers who buy professional gear they may pick up the system to handle their own multimedia creation needs or even use it primarily as a pc gaming platform its the biggest and baddest laptop on the market and is sure to pick up significant sales on that basis alone
3392503 some very serious questions to answer on his return to australia
3392504 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses she said
3392505 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3392506 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3392507 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election ms bishop said
3392508 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3392509 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings ms bishop said

3392512 mr brumby is in the rough and tumble of politics
3392513 our map helps fill the information vacuum created when premier brumby lifted victorias five year gm canola ban and refused to set up an official register worsening the threat of gm contamination
3392514 these rumors caused retailers to start speculating and increasing their prices
3392515 we are 24 higher than last year and for soft drinks even 32 these are the highest volumes recorded in the history of bralirwa
3392516 we see a huge growth up country which is even stronger than in kigali
3392517 we introduced the small primus bottle which has been a big success and we have invested heavily in visibility of our products in all media which have helped to create more awareness and curiosity for the drinks moreover we have continued to focus on the high quality of our brands which has contributed to the growth in demand
3392518 bottle line 2 in gisenyi can now process 30 000 bottles per hour instead of 20 000
3392519 these investments allow us to increase the production with more than 30
3392520 there are also five new fermentation tanks which are now ready and we will see the benefits of that by mid august the bottling line is already running with good line efficiency all these projects however have never hampered our production or output and the just mentioned sales figures give proof of this
3392521 we are particularly proud with this move to provide our clients with a western union money transfer service we believe it is fast efficient and conveniently accessible
3392522 this not only aligns us to the ecobank group policy but also further leverages our group capabilities to strengthen the services we offer
3392523 ecobank is proud to associate its business with western union since it is recognized around the world as a symbol of reliability and trust we are proud of this association
3392524 so we have introduced this system to meet expectations of our customers
3392525 the code cannot be shared as it only accesses ones account in case a client looses a phone he should inform the bank so that they can cancel access to the clients information if the client buys a new phone he is issued with anew pin number
3392526 this facility will facilitate our diaspora clients to access their account information thus reduce the cost of having to travel thousands of miles to check out their accounts status
3392527 through the registering process we request the password protection method that is efficient because you are the only one who knows it
3392528 this system is internationally recognized for providing end point and mutual authentication and communication privacy
3392529 phone banking has been a huge success and we were able to surpass our targets

3392534 after noticing changes in the way tourists visit rwanda during particular seasons we wanted more detailed statistical data of the number of tourists and the purpose of their visit so as to make better planning
3392535 for example more tourists tend to visit in the wet season than during the dry season we also discovered that we have more americans and british than other tourists yet people from other countries are also slowly discovering rwanda for example germany with the figures we have now we can tell what brings them here so as to improve on those areas

3392542 we have always asked them to provide such certificates but we have been lenient due to the fact that they had not built their capacity
3392543 the training would have taken three months on a full time basis if the students could have been available

3392545 politics is the art of controlling your enviroment that is one of the key things i learned in these years and i learned it the hard way anybody who thinks that it doesnt matter whos president has never been drafted and sent off to fight and die in a vicious stupid war on the other side of the world or been beaten and gassed by police for trespassing on public property or been hounded by the irs for purely political reasons or locked up in the cook county jail with a broken nose and no phone access and twelve perverts wanting to stomp your ass in the shower that is when it matters who is president or governor or police chief that is when you will wish you had voted

3392569 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3392570 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3392571 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3392572 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3392573 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around

3392579 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3392580 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment

3392660 acreditamos que as a es devem ser positivamente impactadas com o resultado
3392661 today producers are limited in the amount of irrigation they can apply in a given time frame
3392662 therefore producers need a technique to enable them to save water by determining when their crop actually needs irrigation
3392663 about 20 years ago we theorized the cotton plant itself should be the best source of information for telling us when we should apply irrigation so we began research to prove or disprove this theory
3392664 we investigated various ways to measure plant temperatures in the field and found infrared sensors could do the job adequately subsequently we developed a biologically based irrigation scheduling protocol and named it biotic for biological identified optimal temperature interactive console
3392665 we found threshold temperatures are very critical in scheduling irrigation
3392666 length of time plants are above the optimum threshold setting is also very critical we found changing the time threshold from 5 5 hours to 6 5 hours reduced lint yields about 350 pounds of lint per acre
3392667 the computer program that drives biotic irrigation was designed for full irrigation that is the cotton plants would make maximum yields when they got additional water any time their temperature exceeded 82 degrees f for 5 5 hours unfortunately the underground water supply on the texas high plains is inadequate for full irrigation
3392668 however a producer can easily adjust the time temperature thresholds in the computer so irrigations will be in keeping with his irrigation potential
3392669 the new disaster assistance program is better because it is more comprehensive than past programs which took an ad hoc approach
3392670 this approach is not only more equitable and reliable but it helps to eliminate duplicate payments for the same losses
3392671 its important for growers to be aware of these deadlines so they can make informed decisions about an important part of farm finances
3392672 given how many applications must be reviewed we urge farmers to learn what they are eligible for and apply as soon as possible
3392673 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3392674 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3392675 airline fares are rocketing upward along with higher fuel prices and so are government taxes yet even if you cancel the ticket you still get stuck with the tax and if you change your flight you get hit again
3392676 as is often the case start up companies will lose money as they work to establish their business
3392677 indeed we are in the company of many large established companies that are currently in the red including ford general motors and micron
3392678 a complex undertaking like building a nuclear reactor will take substantial initial investment before profits are realized and people with even a rudimentary understanding of business and investment understand this
3392679 it does not surprise us that our most vocal opposition largely extremist environmentalists who are not familiar with business initiative would have difficulty placing the audit in its proper context
3392680 the companys significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern
3392681 i kind of feel like we are in dr evils secret lair or something
3392682 well this is a much cleaner industry its politically much more popular and its an opportunity to change the world in a positive way whereas in the oil and gas business you are doing more of the same polluting just like you have all those years
3392683 either we develop it here or we watch germany or china or japan develop it and create the jobs there so its very important that the federal government partner with companies like this to make sure we are on the cutting edge

3392688 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities

3392693 we have a lot to make up but we are in the time frame right now where we will be able to tell if the pinks are going to return to prince william sound and southeast alaska
3392694 if this was the end of the season we would be very short across the board but we still have another six weeks ahead with the exception of sockeye and chum salmon salmon harvests have been lower than forecast
3392695 but the jury is still out on the pink salmon harvest
3392696 the pink harvest has started to take off in kodiak but remains flat in southeast and prince william sound
3392697 we are seeing poor runs of multiple species across broad geographic areas
3392698 that indicates to me it is probably an ocean problem but mixed in with those were a few runs that were pretty good
3392699 we have a great record of making escapement goals which is the main thing
3392700 good escapement goals set you up for a good run in the next years

3392962 even though were sad about the loss were going to praise god
3392963 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion has closed
3392964 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
3392965 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
3392966 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3392967 the funding over the next two years became too tight for us so i had to adjust the schedule for that
3392968 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3392969 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3392970 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3392971 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3392972 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3392973 the advantage is that these robots have no fear and wed rather lose one of them than a soldier
3392974 dragon runner can fit into a soldiers kit and is easily deployed
3392975 if that door had been rigged to blow we would have lost a robot but no soldiers would have been hurt
3392976 thats what these units are here for to save soldiers lives
3392977 this unit has escalation of force measures that use a laser range finder for ballistic solutions and a choice of lethal or non lethal deployments
3392978 you can choose from rubber projectiles sponge bags disabling rounds tear gas smoke or lethal rounds
3392979 maars also has a gunshot detection feature so it can pinpoint the direction of shots fired upon it and return fire
3392980 the younger generation of soldiers is going to pick up the use of the controller very quickly
3392981 and my mom said all those years of playing video games would never pay off
3392982 if one robot costs 300 000 but it saves one soldiers life then its worth it

3392984 each year more and more consumers fall victim to various forms of this insidious crime this report puts a spotlight on california highlighting several issues that are likely responsible for driving up these numbers in the state
3392985 however california legislators and government officials law enforcement officers and non profit groups are taking aggressive steps to fight identity theft as highlighted in this report
3392986 the fact is that identity theft is a growing problem
3392987 identity theft will continue to be a problem requiring individuals businesses and government agencies to be constantly vigilant
3392988 we all need to do a better job of protecting sensitive personal information and purging data that we don
3392989 taking six million hours to resolve identity theft related issues is a conservative and underestimated number
3392990 the burden of undoing the damage and restoring the victim
3392991 once a publisher places a widget on their web site consumers can grab it and distribute the widget to other locations on the web including social network pages desktops and blogs

3392996 before athens i was focused on swimming that was it it was all i had
3392997 my whole lifes work was based on olympic gold medals i guess that was a completely wrong outlook now my life is so stable outside swimming that it really doesnt matter the gold medal is just the nice bit at the end if i didnt have it it wouldnt really matter
3392998 some people are destined to do things i guess i was destined to have my ups and downs
3392999 im glad i went through the silvers and the bronzes to get to the gold it makes it so much more worthwhile
3393000 i was probably as low as you possibly can get
3393001 its difficult being a swimmer we have once every four years a major competition you work so hard and put absolutely everything into it youre told before the olympics that you are the best swimmer and you cant be beaten then you are beaten and it is devastating its hard to deal with criticism i sure did cop a lot of it after athens a lot of it was misunderstanding it was really difficult but it made me a much stronger person i think its made this performance much sweeter
3393002 theyre the people that go through the hard days when youre throwing up in your front garden
3393003 it was nice to see that mum was happy she pretty much lives for my swimming
3393004 montreal was still fresh after athens i was still feeling a bit hurt and a bit low i was still searching for myself and still trying to believe in myself as a person
3393005 it was hard being back on the team wondering what people thought of me what i learned in montreal is that i didnt care and it didnt matter every time now when i swim i take that experience in montreal was by far my favourite experience
3393006 in terms of world records i really couldnt care less
3393007 the last 15 metres was pretty much sheer desperation there was no real thought in my head it was just get to the wall and pretty much swim through the wall

3393010 for south floridas sluggish housing market one word became shorthand for the magic elixir to get buyers and sellers on the move again portability gov charlie crist predicted it would spark a sonic boom in home buying but the states home turnover rate of 3 percent is the lowest in years state economists said in a newly released report
3393011 analysts say any portability fueled boost in home sales was swamped by stronger forces pulling down the real estate market in florida and nationwide crumbling home prices tightening credit standards and a wave of foreclosures
3393012 unfortunately the credit crunch hit at the same time as portability said john mike president of the realtors association of the palm beaches
3393013 the foreclosure rates in broward and miami dade counties increased dramatically between 2006 and 2007 in miami dade county 9 814 homes were foreclosed in 2006 and 26 931 were foreclosed in 2007 the foreclosure rate in broward county went from 516 homes in 2006 to 3 616 in 2007
3393014 deerfield beach resident dino lapena said the property next door to his has not been cared for since its foreclosure and he is worried about his own property
3393015 this is a nice neighborhood but now therere so many homes for sale lapena said
3393016 my recent column about the war of words between the presidents of the states banking and mortgage broker trade associations brought this reaction from bradenton appraiser jeff deuitch owner of manatee appraisal service
3393017 i do have to agree with the bankers that a higher proportion of mortgage brokers are unscrupulous than bankers deuitch wrote in an e mail
3393018 in my experience a phone call from a mortgage broker requesting an appraisal for a residential property would nearly always include language about us guaranteeing that a property would achieve some kind of minimum value prior to granting the appraisal assignment said deuitch
3393019 during the 2003 05 period i was fielding one to two calls per day of this type
3393020 it is not to say that this did not occur with banks
3393021 according to figures released june 25 by the u s department of housing and urban development and the u s census bureau 512 000 new single family homes were sold in may of this year that number is 40 3 percent below the number of homes sold in may 2007
3393022 the data confirmed what has been known by developers who arent developing and real estate agents who arent listing because nobodys buying so nobodys selling
3393023 the effects of the real estate slump are also being felt by attorneys who practice in the area of real estate law compared to a year ago my real estate practice is only a third of what it was said bryan goode of dirito goode dempsey at jacksonville beach
3393024 obviously closings are down but our firm is diversified so were focusing on other areas like wills trusts probate and commercial litigation were continuing to pursue real estate but weve got to watch our overhead
3393025 crabtree amp fallars randy crabtree has also watched his practice change with the real estate market
3393026 crabtree also has no idea as to when the market will turn around but did predict it could be an astronomical collapse if something isnt done to get things going again
3393027 but even if you could get land at zero cost you cant build right now for a price anyone can afford and even if interest rates were at 0 percent nobody would make any money so the system wouldnt work its like a tornado everything we knew about real estate is no longer true crabtree said
3393028 outspoken local real estate observer brad runbaken has his worries about the charleston housing market but also sees some positive signs
3393029 the charleston foreclosure market is growing and lets all hope it does not become as large as certain parts of california and florida he says in a second quarter report on the local real estate outlook at the same time there are very good deals out there if you look runbaken says
3393030 runbaken says there is a shadow inventory in charleston that does not show up in the multiple listing service figures hes especially concerned about 500 000 or higher valued homes due to high inventory and jumbo loan rates
3393031 i feel we are exiting what has been a 20 year cycle of low interest rates and we all know the impact interest rates have on the price and financing of homes he says
3393032 the prices of condominiums sold on the grand strand continued falling in july as did the amount of condo inventory according to the monthly coastal carolinas association of realtors report
3393033 the median condo price fell to 149 000 in july thats 16 percent less than its peak this year at 177 500 in march and down 20 percent from july 2007
3393034 whats promising for condo sellers is that the number of condos on the market also dropped in july but just because inventory is going down doesnt mean the property is selling said real estate broker eddie marshall
3393035 some of his clients unwilling to budge on their prices have thrown in the towel for the time being he said
3393036 some obviously sell and then others when theyve been on the market for a while the sellers just decide to take them off the market marshall said
3393037 sales remained sluggish in july at 263 condos sales and 267 single family house sales down 22 percent and 35 percent from july 2007 respectively
3393038 its discouraging on the sales numbers that theyre not rebounding said tom maeser market analyst for the coastal carolinas association of realtors
3393039 twenty years ago the anderson county master in equitys office handled as few as eight foreclosure cases a month today its not unusual to have 80 to 100 foreclosure sales in a month

3393041 lusk said she asked her lender to move payments to the end of her mortgage or drop her monthly bill to 600 until she was earning a steady income the lender was unwilling to do either and now shes facing foreclosure
3393042 i dont understand why they dont want to work with me lusk said
3393043 elaine worzala director of clemson universitys center for real estate development was interviewed by national public radio at the height of lenders aggressiveness she remembers advising people to rent but says her efforts couldnt overcome the hype about the need to own and how you cant lose in real estate
3393044 whats sad is that people were trying to tell the financial community and were trying to tell borrowers but it was like a feeding frenzy and they didnt want to hear it worzala said

3393058 jai eu une saison un peu gal re et il y a quelques mois jaurais sign tout de suite pour un r sultat comme celui l
3393059 in view of the public interest i ought to make it clear that the decision has been made by the crown prosecution service no doubt in consultation with the police to administer a conditional caution and that has been done
3393060 the cps has therefore discontinued proceedings it is not a matter in which the court has any control or authority the matter is now discontinued
3393061 i was at the olympic training center in colorado springs and glenn eller was in houston shooting by himself
3393062 all of us are now shooting together in the marksmanship unit with great competition day in and out among us and its just improved all of our games
3393063 the hardest part of this olympic experience is waiting for the day to get here i wanted to compete at the highest level of clay target shooting to do that i had to commit myself to the sport the u s army and the usamu have given me the necessary resources to compete and win at the level required to win an olympic medal
3393064 the olympics were greater in every aspect than i had anticipated both in highs and lows the emotions involved are so great because of the years of training that go into that one day of competition
3393065 movimos la pelota muy bien y jugamos con mucha intensidad
3393066 me encuentro muy bien estoy estupendamente no tengo nada que demostrar creo que mi carrera es lo suficientemente significativa
3393067 estamos muy contentos porque esta noche hemos jugado con mucha intensidad salimos a la pista con la intenci n de hacer un buen partido y sentirnos orgullosos y me siento muy bien por c mo hemos jugado pero creo que todav a vamos a ser mejores

3393070 estamos en un buen estado de forma y cada vez somos capaces de jugar m s r pido y correr m s con el bal n
3393071 un equipo muy fuerte y de hecho la ltima vez que jugamos contra ellos nos ganaron
3393072 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
3393073 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
3393074 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
3393075 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century
3393076 so i decided after reading some other milblogs to start my own to vent my frustrations and try to keep my sanity intact as much as possible
3393077 growing up in b c toby nunn never imagined hed join the army go to war or become a celebrity let alone one of the most famous non commissioned soldiers to serve with american forces in iraq
3393078 i was just a scrawny kid from the bush up in canada
3393079 a very different view of the war than youll see on the nightly news
3393080 the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage
3393081 you just have to scratch a little bit at the surface and it comes out
3393082 sometimes something will just trigger a memory and ill just start to choke up
3393083 reigns with small flares of absolute tyranny doling out punishment to the masses and the elite equally in spells of burning subjugation

3393085 he talked about the war every now and then and he did point out that hed done the book
3393086 he laughed about going to 22 countries at our countrys expense
3393087 no hay nada que explicar me remito a los resultados del ltimo a o
3393088 es el m ximo candidato al oro porque la pista del torneo ol mpico es una de sus superficies predilectas se desenvuelve mejor y ha obtenido mejores resultados
3393089 cuando vi el cuadro hewitt aparec a como el rival m s fuerte pero sigo viendo el torneo complicado es cierto que ante hewitt especialista en esta superficie jugu un gran partido andreev es complicado tambi n igual que el resto si alguno de los favoritos ha perdido pues mejor
3393090 las sensaciones van y vienen y ojal que ahora pueda mantener el nivel no creo tampoco que haya habido mucha diferencia entre el primer partido y este el duelo contra starace me sirvi para coger el ritmo de la competici n
3393091 hay momentos en los que est s mejor y otros peor se hace duro este es el a o que menos he parado en casa que m s he competido y eso se acusa
3393092 yo siento siempre a mi pa s en cada torneo cuando hay competiciones internacionales en unos juegos ol mpicos a n con m s raz n
3393093 its difficult to say goodbye but as they say life goes on
3393094 its sad because of all the friends ive made its difficult to say goodbye to all these folks
3393095 today marks a milestone in the history of hanau and in the history of the u s army
3393096 for the very last time we have come together to share fond memories of the good times we had and of the critical situations we have mastered together 63 years of working hand in hand for the very last time we have come together to celebrate and honor this wonderful german american partnership between the city of hanau and a great american military community
3393097 with the end of the cold war military requirements shifted and u s troops in hanau were also affected
3393098 as a consequence the hanau military community was significantly reduced
3393099 and probably even more german american babies born as a result of those marriages
3393100 as in any close relationship we had our share of spats
3393101 but we knew in the end things would all work out
3393102 you all contributed greatly to this successful partnership between the army and the city of hanau as we depart we are taking with us the fondest memories of hanau and the people that weve met along the way
3393103 the planning execution and constant attention to every detail that has progressed for two years with our army units agencies soldiers civilians and families has required total emersion by all involved i thank the lord mayor for his vision and for his aggressive actions
3393104 up until a few months ago people still came up to tell me the latest rumor that the army had changed its mind about closing hopefully with todays ceremony and order all such rumors are laid to rest
3393105 but let us not forget that life goes on and good memories always linger
3393106 in closing i echo colonel grahams remarks in saying this is not goodbye but rather auf wiedersehen
3393107 por que motivo esopo se fala do raposo sempre lhe d patente de esperto e audacioso e mais que os outros bichos fino sagaz manhoso

3393177 i said be careful because shes not very smart i said it may be best to write it and not send it he sent me a copy of it i was shocked by half the stuff in there i know his feelings were very badly hurt you know how people can equate money with love im really thrilled that chris is not a hypocrite he was having a hard time sucking up to her
3393178 i was sitting on the subway one time and i looked up and saw a picture of jerry and it was the eye bank ad and i thought nobody on this train knows how freaked out i am
3393179 he used to call me every friday when she went out jerry and i were friends and i always laughed at this person cancilla orbach but i stopped laughing when she started hurting my kids
3393180 we wanted to capture every american and the elegance of gregory peck
3393181 this was not about the beach with girls in high heels this was about the american male and the view of himself
3393182 people think im really confident but i do get self conscious like many women about stripping off in public
3393183 i havent been willingly photographed in a bikini for seven years and i dont think ill do it again at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was a big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self
3393184 i did strive to have my most perfect body and in moments when i lack confidence that voice is always there waiting to tell me you are not good enough do better but im more conscious of it
3393185 it used to be the loudest voice in my head but now i just tell it shut up
3393186 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3393187 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you

3393197 everything was going great until three comics came out each playing a dead star one was playing heath ledger as the joker and he just kept listing prescription pills he had in his pocket another was playing estelle getty and the third was bernie macs ghost
3393198 she shields was so freaked out her eyes welled up and she actually bit her nails at one point when someone pretended to dump estelle gettys ashes on 30 rock actor jack mcbrayers head brooke got up and walked offstage she watched the rest of the show from behind a curtain backstage with a grimace

3393218 lo scontro tra russia e georgia sullossezia del sud che si intensificato drammaticamente ieri ha pi in comune con la guerra delle falklands del 1982 che con una crisi da guerra fredda quando la giunta argentina si crogiolava nel pubblico consenso per essersi ripresa in modo incruento le malvinas henry kissinger predisse la reazione ampiamente inaspettata della gran bretagna commentando nessuna grande potenza si ritira per sempre forse oggi la russia ha interrotto la lunga ritirata verso mosca che era cominciata con gorba v

3393220 she was not at that mindset when i knew her i dont what could have led to that
3393221 both of them were looking like they were prepared for suicide
3393222 she doesnt know how many years but it was the same location and her captors were americans and the treatment was horrendous
3393223 it is a lesson to us all that captains are not necessarily born they can be made
3393224 kevin pietersen might not be the best captain in the world in the next few months but he can learn to become a great captain just as michael vaughan did vaughan got better and better with each game
3393225 it always seemed vaughan and fletcher were still close and certainly closer than vaughan and moores that is understandable but now there is a chance for pietersen and moores to create a bond
3393226 one thing he pietersen will definitely bring is his absolute professionalism he pushes himself hard in all aspects of practice and preparation and if he can create that environment for the rest of the team then he should be successful
3393227 is it cost effective to use a personal injury solicitor to make your compensation claim following an accident
3393228 i couldnt see a light at the end of the tunnel then id been through the infection the hope of healing to the reality that was facing me a life long scar
3393229 yes medical negligence compensation made it all possible if id never been persuaded to contact personal injury solicitors with a view to making a medical negligence compensation claim i never would have managed to afford corrective cosmetic surgery
3393230 medical negligence compensation made this possible before the operation the cyst had been bugging me for a long time eventually as i had some time off work i bit the bullet and decided it was time to have the thing removed my gp explained that it would be a simple procedure it never even entered my mind that i might have to make an accident claim for medical negligence compensation
3393231 on what grounds was it decided you had a valid medical negligence claim
3393232 as the medical profession have a reputation for closing ranks at the mere mention of an accident claim
3393233 as i said before i was fortunate around the time i decided to make my medical negligence compensation claim there was a fair amount of furore relating to an endemic neglect of surgical hygiene in the hospital in which i was operated in id been treated in a ward where negligent medical practices had become the norm rather than the exception
3393234 not really no once i decided to claim medical negligence compensation my personal injury solicitor took control of pretty much everything once id had the independent medical assessments i took a back seat i was basically detached from the accident claim process until my personal injury solicitor contacted me with the good news at that moment i felt satisfied jubilant no but satisfied yes from then i knew id be able to get my face sorted out
3393235 and since youve had the corrective surgery your scars have completely healed
3393236 nearly but not quite to the naked and unscrupulous eye yes i do wear make up which helps cover up evidence of the scarring the cosmetic surgeon also used methods which trick the eye into not seeing what is there dont misunderstand me though i am delighted with the outcome
3393237 our struggle for complete independence from india will continue no power on earth can deter us from achieving this
3393238 however a decision in the matter can be taken only through mutual arrangements between india and pakistan
3393239 earlier reports that the riot was started by disenchanted connells fans protesting the absence of george huntley at saturdays downtown performance were quickly discredited
3393240 at 211 degrees water is hot at 212 degrees it boils and with boiling water comes steam and with steam you can power a train
3393241 its a great shame that given the depressing nature of the credit crisis we couldnt at least have a bit of sunshine
3393242 you do see some people braving it on the beaches in the pouring rain theres something of the dunkirk spirit among some tourists but it is pretty miserable for everyone at least our competitors in brittany and normandy are suffering as much as us
3393243 we are seeing a risk of severe gales along the south coast and the weather is showing no sign of lifting soon
3393244 with the potential for further heavy rain the flood risk remains high
3393245 weve got to see some significant improvements over the next couple of years
3393246 show us needing to achieve some form of step change to move on from where we have been in the last four years
3393247 one quoted me the prices again adding that i was purchasing a full body massage with adult conversation

3393249 kadix systems customer presence significantly increases the percentage of our business mix focused on high growth markets a key strategic focus for drc
3393250 we are likely to fall short but reach 125 very soon in 2009 reflecting the constraints of the government cooling the economy and the sichuan earthquake
3393251 we are seeing short term benefits but we are looking to the long term outlook for china
3393252 if we thought we were finished we would have lost
3393253 thats what the chinese do so well against us they fight when theyre down then come back
3393254 they never give us anythng so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change and come back from five points down in the third set
3393255 it was probably the best eight or nine points we have played against one of the best pairs in the world
3393256 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese in the first round in china
3393257 and the fact she beat us in the olympic final four years ago might have given us a little bit more incentive but its the olympics games and all that
3393258 i just want to get on with the next match now
3393259 as a precaution we have stopped pumping oil through that earlier this morning
3393260 we are already cutting taxes this year by around 4 billion
3393261 that is in part to help support the economy at a difficult time whether it is increasing tax credits or tax allowances or freezing fuel duty at a rate below inflation
3393262 but i think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate whether it is households or businesses from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen
3393263 while we still think that the mpc could cut interest rates before the end of the year a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3393264 a perilously weak economy has prevented the bank of englands monetary policy committee tightening policy but inflation is likely to prevent rate cuts before early next year
3393265 these figures show that things are only getting tighter for families across the uk
3393266 its clear that inflation is not being driven by pay but by shifts in energy and food prices across the world
3393267 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3393268 this in turn will reduce labor costs and streamline the front house staff the group hopes
3393269 i have just come to the conclusion that raleigh has peaked in terms of these lists
3393270 tropic thunder is pushing the envelope too far for groups representing the mentally disabled
3393271 call me by my name not by my label and chanted phrases like
3393272 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside said special olympics global messenger dustin plunkett
3393273 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3393274 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities
3393275 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3393276 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3393277 my job is to try to help clubs produce scottish players and give them an opportunity to play for their country
3393278 players do leave but good players come in as well the spl is a very competitive league it was tremendous last season going to the last game and there was some exciting football im sure it wont be any different this year
3393279 i said at the time when barry got injured that it would be a huge loss for scottish football both for rangers and for scotland
3393280 it has been shown how much rangers have missed him but we cant do anything about it
3393281 barry is working hard on his rehabilitation and hopefully he will have a speedy recovery but he has to be right before he can play and that could be another couple of months
3393282 we have other players in our squad who we feel are very capable in that department ive still got selection problems in terms of who to leave out so weve got players who can fill that role
3393283 as a country we are fortunate to have so many outstanding midfield players i think ive got the midfield squad to cope while rangers got a few injuries at the worst possible time for them
3393284 weve brought a few new players into the squad and the game is only two and a half weeks before the world cup qualifiers start
3393285 ill be looking for a positive game in terms of hopefully winning the game which i think would be important and in terms of being a bit more positive in our attacking play
3393286 its something we would all like to be using a lot more but its really just starting
3393287 i felt like maybe i could talk to both sides
3393288 certainly in a museum youd like to be on the forefront of new activity and computer imaging would be at the forefront of what to do
3393289 now i come along as a copyist i cant do the original in one motion because im not van gogh
3393290 so i strike the brush multiple times to mimic the art
3393291 i guess the easiest way to think about it is youre a detective at a murder scene you got to collect a lot of evidence but you dont really know which piece of evidence is the one that cracks it open for you
3393292 thats the job so to speak of the conservators of the museum
3393293 they try to add a whole bunch of other evidence and try to make a decision about authentication
3393294 hey bob what do you think of the usa mali game you gonna lay the points
3393295 i dont know man i like mali to stick around i think they come with 61 poinits
3393296 have you seen mali play theyll be down by 50 in the first half its just a matter if lisa leslie and co will call off the dogs
3393297 naaa malis a pesky team i think they crawl and scratch to a 40 point loss theyll lose by 40 or 50 but theyll cover
3393298 mi madre fue maestra en el sistema escolar y muchas veces ella sacaba de su propio
3393299 it is important to emphasize that it takes relatively moderate levels of physical activity like brisk walking to attain the associated health benefits
3393300 certainly one does not need to be a marathon runner this is the message that we need to convey to the public
3393301 all you need is between two and three hours of brisk walking a week you can spread that out between four and six days a week

3393306 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3393307 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3393308 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3393309 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3393310 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3393311 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person
3393312 the escalation on the part of the russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3393313 amazing amazing amazing so accurate like you know the couple strongly recommend
3393314 wow you really nailed me highly gifted lady that sees clearly thank u so much

3393316 excellent value detailed reading and quick with response will recommend
3393317 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3393318 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3393319 until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything

3393437 what i saw there the prisoners situation was one which you would absolutely recognize from the photographs of guantanamo the prisoners were housed in little wooden huts some alone others in pairs or threes each hut was surrounded with barbed wire and guards were patrolling between them around all of this was a high wall with watchtowers because these people had been arrested directly by the army they had not had any recourse to the judicial system they had no lawyers there was no appeals process there werent even exact orders about how long they were to be kept prisoner

3393442 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3393443 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3393444 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3393445 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3393446 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3393461 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3393462 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3393463 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3393464 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3393465 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3393467 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3393468 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3393469 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3393470 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3393471 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3393485 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3393486 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3393487 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3393488 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3393489 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3393490 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3393491 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3393492 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3393493 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3393494 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3393495 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3393496 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3393497 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3393498 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3393499 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3393502 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3393503 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3393504 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3393505 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3393506 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3393507 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3393508 who are open to doing something on the production side
3393509 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

3393527 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3393528 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3393529 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3393530 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3393531 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3393532 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3393533 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3393534 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3393535 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3393536 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3393537 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3393538 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3393539 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3393540 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3393541 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3393542 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3393543 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3393544 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3393545 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3393546 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3393547 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3393548 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3393549 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3393550 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3393551 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3393552 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3393553 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3393554 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3393555 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3393556 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3393557 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

3393560 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3393561 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3393562 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3393563 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3393564 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3393565 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3393566 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3393567 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3393568 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3393645 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3393646 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3393647 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3393728 obviously star wars was a huge opportunity for me and opened a lot of doors but just on a basic cool level i got to play darth vader its not often where you get to work on a film and run around every day with a lightsaber i really have no qualms about that character following me for the rest of my life
3393729 the very first day hayden walked out on the set with the darth vader suit was about two or three weeks before we finished shooting about 1 000 people from all over sydney came to watch it because it was like a seminal iconic moment in their life we tried to let as many people on the stage as we could
3393730 the films bind generations together it grows on the younger people because the mom and dad talk about them they develop a common bond in families
3393731 its tough on me because i have to see the movies quite a number of times to watch all the rest of me in the background
3393732 in the early days they put out an action figure that made me look like the blond guy from scooby doo but now theyre becoming a little more sophisticated theyre putting the cleft in my chin and making my hair brown instead of yellow
3393733 my daughter likes them because she can stick pins in them when shes mad at me
3393734 the first time i went to a convention i went how pathetic seeing all these people dressing up in silly costumes
3393735 well wait a minute this is exactly what i do for a job i better shut up
3393736 in 1982 i met a young kid with his dad and recently that young kid came to a convention here he had grown up and had become an animator because of the star wars movies its extraordinary how many people have caught on to george lucas dream and many of those youngsters are now working in animation studios or are directors or film cameramen its done an awful lot of good
3393737 they invited me into their family and now i can go around the world and hold my head and chin up and say im part of the lucasfilm family new zealand is such a small place i never imagined being in a movie let alone star wars when i had my first day of filming i knew as soon as the first shoot that this was my new family every time i see them they treat me like family
3393738 its been great being a part of that whole experience all of us who had the experience working with george lucas have been very fortunate were talking about a real legacy
3393739 it was the shampoo where you could twist off my head and pour liquid out of my neck lather up with leia and youll feel like a princess yourself i dont think they make it anymore but that was my favorite

3393759 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3393760 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3393761 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3393762 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3393763 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3393764 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3393765 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3393766 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3393767 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3393768 some things you never want to say so i wont but it was just weird the way the scoring went every time raushee would score somehow this kid lee got points also i dont know
3393769 i felt like i should have been up after every round
3393770 i felt like it wasnt the right scoring to come this far and lose in the first round it aint right it doesnt seem real to me
3393771 we were screaming for him to throw punches but he was looking up the stands and they were telling him to move
3393772 i came this far to lose in the first round again
3393773 it should be the right scoring and it should be fair to everybody i felt like a lot more punches should have been scored
3393774 i think hes going to get it all figured out
3393775 i dont think theres going to be anything left for him but to get this championship done at this olympics
3393776 i felt like i shed off a lot of pressure and burden
3393777 if he has a good competition i dont think it will be possible to step up and take over his position in the all around

3393799 he was talking about the latest smoke screen in the presidential election the bogus contention that lifting restrictions on offshore oil drilling would somehow in the foreseeable future bring down the price of gasoline for american motorists this absurd contention is now one of the main issues of the campaign its the latest example of a very real fear that sky high energy prices will undermine the average familys standard of living being exploited shamelessly for political purposes

3393836 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3393837 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3393838 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3393839 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker

3393859 golf can be such a frustrating game ive played for 30 years and im still terrible
3393860 if you dont see progress immediately it can get frustrating
3393861 so were trying to keep it fun and interesting so theyll keep coming back
3393862 thatll be good for them to play 18 holes before they go to the regional

3393869 it remaining in the best interests of st george shareholders compared to the position when the proposed merger was announced on may 13 2008
3393870 there can be a lot of dynamics in the market theres also the exchange ratio and there was the issue frankly of the westpac share price having come off from when the transaction was first signalled to the market
3393871 and then the other issue is that for both of us due diligence just doesnt finish
3393872 its an ongoing basis them on us us on them
3393873 that is being achieved with a 17 million post tax gain on visa ipo proceeds virtually no growth in 2h08 expenses and no growth in bad debt expense suggests a low quality result
3393874 at the moment st georges total cost of funds is quite similar to the major banks
3393875 so that more than covers the 10 to 12 basis points that we expect going forward if funding markets stay where they are
3393876 we may see that requirement drop down to 10 billion or in fact lower
3393877 our vision is big but it makes sense we want to see 34 stations by 2020
3393878 we could become the absolute world leader at about number eight and that would be a wonderful place to be at this is a real solution with serious players and proven technology
3393879 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3393880 we didnt know when it would work and were quite surprised at how well it will work
3393881 cattle prices in the last couple of years have been depressed mainly due to drought in the southern part of australia up until this year
3393882 we expect if the price stays up then the second half would be quite good
3393883 that means australia as an industry will be more competitive on the world beef scene with a lower entry price into korea and japan and into the us itself which are our three big markets
3393884 our money is made in export we are much more comfortable now the dollar is dropping away and the market dynamics are starting to kick in
3393885 morphed a bit from where it was before to be more realistic about what is happening in the world in terms of other agriculture other proteins and competing proteins like soybeans and vegetable proteins
3393886 they are bringing different perspectives from what we had before
3393887 we did have an inordinate focus on just being the best beef producer in the world but i think it distorted our thinking as a company
3393888 most people automatically assume that the money used for the construction of the cross was the only money ever spent towards non profit activities

3393891 i hope the british board of film classification will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification

3393913 although current treatment is effectively successful in half of cases there is often substantial damage to the brain from treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well
3393914 if were ever going to tackle these childhood brain cancers we need to be more targeted in our approach
3393915 we have done some work on the potential impact on premiums
3393916 id have to say its nowhere near the 5 range that a number of people have talked about probably less than half that
3393917 we both agree with private health insurers that the effect of this will be of the order of 5 on premiums there will be a 10 increase in premiums but 5 of that was going to happen anyway
3393918 sin eso no puede ser comercializado en gran breta a lo que haga el resto del mundo es cosa suya nosotros debemos asegurarnos de que valores modernos y civilizados tengan prioridad por encima de matar y mutilar gente

3393947 we had a consistent run in the four years leading up to 2004 and winning the silver medal was an incredible accomplishment
3393948 this time given the whole roller coaster ride weve had its just unbelievable that this team stuck together we never gave up we always believed
3393949 he holds us to a level of optimism and hes a spiritual guy he kept us upbeat for this whole he blends in with the team and hes one of us
3393950 i truly admire everything hes done and i have to give him a lot of credit if he wasnt around i dont know if we could have done this
3393951 i said to him raj do you realize youve got an olympic medal around your neck

3394043 yesterday afternoon family liaison officers were able to contact the parents of zhen zing yang via an interpreter notifying them of their sons death
3394044 the family have been traced to an address in dalian city in china and contact was made via telephone
3394045 the senior investigating officer and family liaison officers ahve met with the consular attache from the peoples republic of china
3394046 they were updated with the progress of the investigation and met with chinese community leaders in the west end of newcastle
3394047 forensic examinations at the crime scene at 8 croydon road
3394048 the bathroom of the house has been searched in a washing up bowl under the sink was the body of a mature cat
3394049 the washing up bowl had been filled with water and resting on top of the bowl concealing the body of the cat was toweling and kitchen gloves
3394050 the dead cat is believed to have been a family pet of the deceased and is predominantly black with some white markings
3394051 investigating officers are conducting forensic tests to establish the cause of death of the pet
3394052 officers are keeping an open mind as to the significance of this find
3394053 however one possibility being considered is the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders
3394054 the post mortem findings from the autopsy conducted into the death of zhen zing yang have revealed extensive brusing to both forearms of the deceased
3394055 the bruising is approximate to the time of death however the ageing of the brusing is such that it may be indicative of an assault having occured an hour or so before the fatal head injuries
3394056 further forensic tests need to be conducted to age the bruising
3394057 there have been a number of calls from the public to the incident room which are currently being investigated and we are pleased with the public response however we still need more information to assist establishing the exact time of death and the motive for these killings
3394058 both victims have died as a result of head injuries and in the female case from asphyxia
3394059 the extent of the injuries to ci ci is far less than the male
3394060 it begs the question whether there is anything in the chinese culture relating to the killing of the cat
3394061 i am asking to have this killing checked with nationally to see whether there are any other links to cases of a similar nature
3394062 we are still desperately short of information about the male
3394063 was he working we dont know his last movements remain a phone call
3394064 there is nothing in his past or background that lead us to think of a motive for him being killed
3394065 our central view remains that inflation will fall back this year as the rises in domestic gas and electricity prices last year drop out of the annual comparison and the recent cuts in prices feed through to household bills

3394067 when we go to the delta state of sleep the body does its own healing which is why when youre ill or have surgery the doctor tells you to get plenty of rest its been proven through various studies that reiki will help induce a delta state in the brain
3394068 in reiki we learn how to access a higher energy we channel it and use our hands to bring it to the client during a treatment were connected to the higher life force which then passes through us so that the clients energy can take from it what it needs to heal
3394069 its based on quantum physics theory all energy interacts with all energy theres energy everywhere and everything interacts with everything anderson says
3394070 scientific research has shown that when a therapist starts providing energy there is a place at the base of their brain at the hypothalamus that starts to vibrate with a higher vibration and the same thing happens in the clients brain in the same place and they begin to vibrate in unison

3394157 wenn russland die unabh ngigkeit von abchasien und s dossetien anerkennt wird georgien der weg in die nato offen stehen und fremde truppen werden auf seinem territorium stationiert werden neben allem anderen wird georgien den terroristen separatisten und extremisten im nordkaukasus jede m gliche unterst tzung erweisen

3394180 today gives the nation an opportunity to recognize the potential of our youth to celebrate their achievements and plan for ways to better engage young people to successfully take action in the development of our nation ghana
3394181 today presents an opportunity for us decision makers to rally together to ensure that young people are included in decision making at levels that affect them directly as well as indirectly and i pledge myself to that course
3394182 in building a better ghana the youth will be at the center of the development agenda for after all the future belongs to them and they should have a stake in planning their future
3394183 there is no denying the fact that there exists a lot of despondency amongst the youth of ghana especially as regards the crunching of employment opportunities and in building a better ghana investing in the youth and job creation shall be key pivots around which policy decisions will revolve
3394184 the illicit drug trade has not only targeted ghana but has targeted the youth of ghana and i am assuring the youth that atta mills as president will make sure ghana ceases to be a subsidiary of the illicit and nation destroying drug trade
3394185 the reports that scores of youth are falling victim to the drug menace leading to the high crime rate as well as drug related mental illnesses is too frightening to be ignored and i will do whatever it takes to keep the barons far away from ghana
3394186 i believe that a better ghana can be built and together with the youth of ghana and all concerned ghanaians we shall indeed build a better ghana

3394203 missed a good chance for rain on 8 7 08 storms seemed to split and go around the county again
3394204 slightly lower daytime highs towards the end of the week is the only good news last 3 weeks provided barely an inch of rain over this county soil moisture is backing up fast as are forages hay yield is below average quality is average at best

3394327 each year more and more consumers fall victim to various forms of this insidious crime this report puts a spotlight on california highlighting several issues that are likely responsible for driving up these numbers in the state
3394328 however california legislators and government officials law enforcement officers and non profit groups are taking aggressive steps to fight identity theft as highlighted in this report
3394329 the fact is that identity theft is a growing problem
3394330 identity theft will continue to be a problem requiring individuals businesses and government agencies to be constantly vigilant
3394331 we all need to do a better job of protecting sensitive personal information and purging data that we don
3394332 taking six million hours to resolve identity theft related issues is a conservative and underestimated number

3394355 were excited about our partnership with pollinate media many clients are having trouble justifying their investments in the digital space too often interactive companies are focused on building things in the digital space versus concentrating on the ideal places that brands should be and why and how consumers might want to interact with them there

3394361 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3394362 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3394363 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3394364 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3394365 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3394366 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3394367 now we have to see whether the russians are not only stopping military operations but redeploying and withdrawing the troops that have been brought into georgia on august 6 and accept international monitoring of the ceasefire agreement
3394368 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3394369 russia began the active stage of large scale military exercises in several regions of the southern federal district which includes the highly volatile north caucasus republics a senior military official said the exercise dubbed caucasus frontier 2008 involves units of the north caucasus military district mainly the 58th army the 4th air force army interior ministry troops and border guards

3394372 as a precaution we have stopped pumping oil through that earlier this morning

3394377 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea university teachers should simply accept as variant spellings those words our students most commonly misspell
3394378 the spelling of the word judgement for example is now widely accepted as a variant of judgment so why cant truely be accepted as a variant spelling of truly
3394379 all i am suggesting is that we might well put 20 or so of the most commonly misspelt words in the english language on the same footing as those other words that have a widely accepted variant spelling
3394380 they considered the legal implications of nings terms and conditions

3394819 now lots and lots of menz say patriarchy hurts them too because ya know it restricts them into certain gender roles well first of all patriarchy is not the same as gender any more than white supremacy is the same as race the idea that gender is an essential quality is used to justify patriarchy in the same way that the idea that race is an essential quality is used to justify white supremacy so gender might stop you wearing a frock but if you say you want to wear a frock to express your feminine side you are maintaining the thing that oppressses you anyway so just stop it
3394820 you never do your share of the housework you leave messes for me to clean up you act like a baby when im not in the mood for sex and if i am in the mood i gotta deal with your dick in my face the whole time yeah real subtle you want me to suck your dick i get it oh and by the way women are capable of having orgasms you know and how come you always drive when we go anywhere

3394827 yes its what about the menz time again its just so terrible that were oppressing you we feel so guilty that were oppressing you that were going to focus intensely on how were oppressing you how that makes us feel and the effect that has on us and were going to really really look in depth at us so that we can think exclusively of what it feels like this horrible feeling of oppressing you because otherwise theres a possibility that the focus may shift from us for five minutes and then what would happen
3394828 the concept of privileged groups confronting their privilege is an extremely problematic one about the only sensible way that it can be done is for members of the privileged group to shut up and listen to members of the non privileged group otherwise it just becomes an exercise in demonstrating just what a fabulous super right on person you are and becomes guess what all about you
3394829 racism isnt bad for me its good for me im a member of the privileged group
3394830 lm says she finds it uncomfortable listening to white feminists deconstruct white privilege and i understand what shes saying
3394831 violence against transpeople is committed by men not by radical feminists
3394832 but gender is a concept and anyone reinforcing that concept is anti fem
3394833 they are neither feminists nor friends to women trans or non trans
3394834 these are valid women and those are not valid women
3394835 they agree with me thus trans people agree with me
3394836 hope you like the richard dawkins video anyway sparks he is pure dead brilliant what if youre wrong
3394837 i call on men around the world to lead by example to make clear that violence against women is an act perpetrated by a coward and that speaking up against it is a badge of honor
3394838 hey lara youre back just in the nick of time well somewhere on those comment threads your bdsm battle at the f word is linked

3394842 at the same time just wanted to underline again that if people have a problem with what weve written on any subject here at the blog or elsewhere i dont want people to feel like they cant point it out if they feel were doing something wrong or said something that could be interpretted to be homophobic or otherwise problematic its really really important to us that this happens i agree with the criticism of the way that samara originally worded her post and its very good that readers said something about it and prompted this whole debate
3394843 we value feedback and take criticisms extremely seriously snip we want to open this out to our readers to see what you think weve always tried to be open to criticism and honest about our aims and motives and hope to continue this approach if you dont want to post publicly you can contact us via the comment page thank you for your lovely comments so far
3394844 and as well the f word doesnt take a stance on any issue within feminism whether that be women only spaces or whatever we simply publish feminist writing and the opinions expressed are always those of the writers not any kind of party line that includes what i write or what catherine writes were only ever expressing our personal views
3394845 as always i would just emphasise that what goes up on the f word really does just reflect the submissions we receive if the f word has an agenda at all it is to represent the widest range of opinion possible but we are dependent on the feminist community to submit features and reviews to us suggestions on how we can expand our coverage to touch on more lesbian feminist issues would be gratefully received
3394846 an open letter to catherine redfern owner of the f word
3394847 there is evidence that some important gender appropriate behaviours result from the childs ability to categorise themselves as a boy or girl

3394849 this is a direct quote from laura woodhouses blog post
3394850 at the same time just wanted to underline again that if people have a problem with what weve written on any subject here at the blog or elsewhere i dont want people to feel like they cant point it out if they feel were doing something wrong or said something that could be interpretted to be homophobic or otherwise problematic its really really important to us that this happens i agree with the criticism of the way that samara originally worded her post and its very good that readers said something about it and prompted this whole debate

3394856 it is the prosecutions case that this defendant shanniel hyatt went to the flat of kellie telesford having spent the evening with her
3394857 he strangled her leaving at about 6am having stolen her possessions including her mobile telephone her oyster travel card and electronic equipment
3394858 he said he had only discovered that kellie had been born a man about an hour before the police interview
3394859 had he known about her gender he would have left straight away he denied he had found out and reacted badly to it and became violent as a result
3394860 while we are referring to her as a female out of courtesy because that is how she wanted to be known she was nevertheless a male with a mans strength and you would have thought that she as a victim would have fought her attacker but there was no signs

3394895 10 questions to ask before you blog http blog junta42 com content marketing blog 2008 07 index html
3394896 one of the most frequent questions i receive while traveling is about blogging the questions revolve around how to get started what to talk about and what software to use
3394897 you either the need the body of a girl to express specific character traits or you dont give up
3394898 no one is denying that transwomen suffer violence but they suffer violence at the hands of men not radical feminists
3394899 and cretin is also abelist as it is a recognised condition of severely underdeveloped physical
3394900 the experience of trans gendered people indicates that there is at least some natural biological component to gender
3394901 the subject was the lack of attention given to violence against trans women and the general lack of attention to this issue by feminist bloggers
3394902 theres also no evidence that transwomen are any less violent than biomen cismen boogymen
3394903 calling a transwoman a he is like saying the n word
3394904 that would imply that i chose a gendered identity like most trans people claim they have done i have not done that
3394905 and ive never met rich either but i know hes a gay man and gay men are often raped attacked and often killed
3394906 well you or i could choose to live as the opposite gender for whatever reason but we arent
3394907 i had to become a woman or id have killed myself castrated myself with a blunt rock etc
3394908 though i would have been mortified if i was wrong
3394909 the trans activists want to be inclusive of these part time women they do their cause no favours
3394910 it would be nice if feminism was brought back on track the focus of the entire life of females in this world from cradle to grave
3394911 look at me look at this that and the other
3394912 if it was being argued that only women whove had full sex reassignment surgery should be allowed into women only spaces it would be a completely different matter
3394913 yet for a woman born in a male body to have the right body surgical chemical intervention is needed which is biologically essentialist because it means you can only be a woman if you have female genitals and all this reifies gender which trans is supposed to be challenging
3394914 congratulations youre not reinforcing gender thats good now go away we dont want you in our place until you have surgery
3394915 secondly i dont think its my business to tell anyone else what to do with their body society needs to ensure people get the bodies they genuinely want need not the ones theyre forced into having by gender
3394916 because people who know no better will think all transwomen are nasty bullies they arent i know that
3394917 ugly rapist piece of shit m a n in a dress
3394918 for example the drawing up of laws to prevent discrimination against transsexuals are continually watered down to include men who like to do some dressing up a woman at the weekends
3394919 im not being discriminated against because i have an employer who has mistaken beliefs about how women should act im being discriminated against because my employer is treating me like a woman might be treated when in reality i have a masculine gender identity
3394920 congratulations youre not reinforcing gender thats good now go away we dont want you in our place until you have surgery
3394921 yet for a woman born in a male body to have the right body surgical chemical intervention is needed
3394922 i will explain why i personally disagree with what you are about to do but i wont tell you not to do it
3394923 if you know the answer you dont understand the question
3394924 rich ive answered elly as youll see now i presume its elly that youre addressing your comment to as this isnt the f word can i ask everyone to be nice to each other yes lets debate but lets debate in an adult and reasoned manner not swop insults
3394925 because as i say such spaces are about biological sex not gender
3394926 and as a general point it does fascinate me how much admittance to a woman only space is a prize of some sort to be fought over
3394927 im not being discriminated against because i have an employer who has mistaken beliefs about how women should act im being discriminated against because my employer is treating me like a woman might be treated when in reality i have a masculine gender identity
3394928 its perfectly fine to treat women like shit but you cant treat me like shit because im not a woman
3394929 ugly rapist piece of shit m a n in a dress
3394930 so you consider yourself to have a womans gender identity
3394931 well actually i consider myself transsexual its my sex not my gender i cannot reconcile
3394932 hirself now doesnt that relate to someone who identifies as third gender
3394933 the argument is that ciswoman is justified because trans woman is used but the point is that trans woman is only used when its necessary to denote someones trans status
3394934 i can understand cis women are reluctant to accept trans women in women only space
3394935 when the author of the piece used the pronoun hirself now doesnt that relate to someone who identifies as third gender

3394945 yet most of us still accept on faith the integrity of the election process i hope that watching uncounted so close to the presidential election will shake to the core any preconceived beliefs and encourage immediate action before its too late
3394946 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as
3394947 the exchange rate is unquestionably one variable that influences the dollar price of oil in recent data as much as 20 of oil price movements could be attributed to changes in the exchange rate or at least to news developments that matter for both exchange rates and oil prices but that also means that 80 of what we see happening to the price of oil is completely uncorrelated with whatever might be influencing the exchange rate

3395034 una cosa es ver pasar el transporte p blico habanero a trav s de los informes que publica el r gimen y otra bien distinta es tenerlo que abordar a diario en las paradas
3395035 sin embargo ahora mismo existe una contrariedad que aunque no sea nueva parece no haber sido prevista a la hora de redactar los jubilosos informes
3395036 muchos de los mnibus articulados de procedencia china una vez listos para el servicio e incluso ubicados ya en las terminales permanecen inactivos porque no encuentran qui nes los conduzcan sobran las plazas vacantes para choferes y cobradores pero faltan los empleados que se interesen por cubrirlas
3395037 este d ficit desarmoniza en forma alarmante con el proyecto de reestructuraci n para el transporte p blico en la habana y la causa es tan elemental que cuesta creer que no haya recibido el tratamiento que demanda y con la debida anticipaci n sencillamente los salarios estipulados para tales empleados incluso despu s de cierto tibio incremento de ltima hora no se corresponden con el esfuerzo que deben realizar ni con la responsabilidad que asumen adem s de que no les alcanza para alimentar a sus familias
3395038 vox p puli que lo sabe todo y aquello que no sabe se lo imagina anda diciendo ahora que para suplir esta escasez de empleados en el transporte p blico capitalino las autoridades planean traer cargas masivas de conductores desde el oriente del pa s no hay por qu dudarlo aunque no se haya informado oficialmente ya que nuestra tan sufrida y postergada regi n oriental ha sido utilizada por el r gimen como una especie de reservorio para mano de obra en tareas ingratas mal calificadas y peor pagadas que adem s se niegan a realizar los trabajadores residentes en la habana
3395039 nos mandan estados unidos la cuarta la quinta y la veinte flota eso es candela

3395054 the significance of shebaa farms which constitutes the backbone of the resistance is in terms of sovereignty and for the protection of the people shebaa farms is very important for important resources it is very rich in water and has very fertile soil
3395055 it is a lebanese internal issue if we will disarm the arms are not an end in itself the government has the right to monopolize arms and fight israel but the government has to assume its responsibility and in our case it didnt if shebaa farms is liberated it is being discussed internally what the strategy would be next
3395056 you cannot negotiate under occupation i joined hezbollah because they were fighting the occupation i have never done anything in my life i have no military training i have always been in academia i dont hate anyone we dont fight the israelis because theyre jews but because theyre occupiers i reserve the right to fight anyone who is perceived as an occupier
3395057 it is the duty of every lebanese to fight it does not help hezbollah to be the only one fighting the arms are not an end in itself
3395058 the israelis had a position to begin a peace process but now i dont believe it in this situation you have to fight does this bring us closer to peace i dont think so
3395059 lebanon is not in a spot to have sharia law it cannot happen people dont understand the diversity of lebanon it has never been a hezbollah policy to implement sharia
3395060 were talking about the rule of law there are many values in a democracy that should be embraced
3395061 i believe the combination of arms and diplomacy will help bring more results
3395062 hezbollah is not a state when we talk about normalizing relations were talking about states i dont believe there will be any normalization of relations anytime in the near future
3395063 i want you to produce proof that hezbollah has done anything to serve the iranian cause and not the lebanese cause we are lebanese we only serve lebanon
3395064 it is our right as victims of the occupation to accept arms from anyone wholl give them we havent chosen to be resistance fighters we opened our eyes and our country was occupied and its our responsibility to fight
3395065 im not optimistic about the future of the region there will be more wars because israel is not committed to peace they believe they have international immunity
3395066 i dont see any kind of positive role for the americans an honest broker does not exist
3395067 the israelis have been very successful you have to respect what they do the arabs should help from their positions maybe we are lazy maybe we dont have much incentive if we lobby we lobby against each other
3395068 hezbollah is crucial in uniting the country again we want a political platform that encompasses all the parties who believe in the sovereignty of lebanon hezbollah wants political and economic reform they want every party to fairly represented it was not in any way trying to maximize its profits after the israeli failure in 2006
3395069 during the syrian reign in lebanon hezbollah had no opportunity for a public servant in lebanon the only thing that brought them together is the resistance against the occupation
3395070 no arab army is capable of standing up to the israeli army so youre talking about secretive positions that could be very successful it might be a merge between different brigades between hezbollah and the government military

3395239 b ut if the affray be over there must be an express warrant
3395240 t here is not to be found a single authority decision or textbook in the library of this court that sanctions the doctrine that the legislature a municipality or congress can determine what is a reasonable arrest

3395244 where an highhanded offense had been committed and an immediate arrest became necessary to prevent an escape
3395245 considered the arrest warrant far more important than todays decision leaves it
3395246 t he fact is that a felony at common law and a felony today bear only slight resemblance with the result that the relevance of the common law rule of arrest to the modern interpretation of our constitution is minimal
3395247 ruinous damages whenever an officer has deviated from the rigid letter of the law or been guilty of any unnecessary act of insolence or oppression

3395623 as the final season of the wire moved past its midpoint i began reading assertions and arguments that it is one of the three best dramatic shows that has even been on tv the sopranos and deadwood are the other two
3395624 one advantage that deadwood has over the other two i agree superlative shows paradoxically in a way is that it was cancelled after its third series by luck or judgment the ending of the third series works id say on pretty much every level as a conclusion for the whole i mean had the show been cancelled after series two it would have been a much lesser text the sopranos however was sublime for two series precisely because it was at its heart a show about tonys relationship with his mother whilst she was still in the story it was unsurpassed telly once she died the show dragged itself through a number of contortions about what its focus now was and being as popular as it was with audiences and advertisers the makers span it out and span it out diminishing returns the wire is into what five series now for me deadwood wins
3395625 i think the end of deadwood was terrible a classic case of commerce cutting a work short before the story was done

3395783 id much rather have a neteqd open connection than a nated nonmanaged one thats for sure
3395784 netequalizer never opens up any customer data and thus cannot be accused of spying connections are treated as a metered resource
3395785 the isps that use netequalizer simply put a policy in their service contracts stating how many connections they support end of story bittorrent is still allowed to run albeit not as wide with unlimited connections
3395786 i am not a fan of bandwidth control the correct solution is for providers to build out more capacity by reinvesting their profits however ill concede a solution such as a netequalizer is much more palatable than redirecting or specially blocking bittorrent and also seems to be more acceptable to consumers than bandwidth caps or metered plans
3395787 there is a risk though who decides what the peaks times are how much bandwidth connections would that be let me reiterate i would rather see that isps invest in network capacity than network managing hardware

3395808 regione calabria e provincia di cosenza pongano mano con la determinazione che la situazione richiede a un progetto serio che dia certezze alla provincia di cosenza per risolvere tale drammatica situazione
3395809 fortemente preoccupato come amministrazione per levolversi di una vicenda gi prevista da tempo ed annunciata nella sua drammaticit
3395810 il suo percorso intrapreso e chiede che al pi presto la magistratura chiarisca la vicenda dellincendio nella discarica di contrada campolescio e si giunga in tempi ragionevoli al suo dissequestro per evitare che gli allarmismi strumentali blocchino le iniziative programmate e che il tutto si risolva ancora una volta in un danno irreparabile per le nostre comunit costrette a subire loffesa dellinerzia politica e della demagogia imperante che comportano gravissimi danni ambientali ed altissimi costi di gestione
3395811 solo la determinazione dellamministrazione di centro destra e dellassessorato allambiente hanno impedito che in questi giorni nella citt calasse il drammatico scenario dei rifiuti vissuto a napoli
3395812 the world can be divided in many ways rich and poor democratic and authoritarian but one of the most striking is the divide between the societies with an individualist mentality and the ones with a collectivist mentality these sorts of experiments have been done over and over again and the results reveal the same underlying pattern americans usually see individuals chinese and other asians see contexts
3395813 the individualistic countries tend to put rights and privacy first people in these societies tend to overvalue their own skills and overestimate their own importance to any group effort people in collective societies tend to value harmony and duty they tend to underestimate their own skills and are more self effacing when describing their contributions to group efforts either way individualistic societies have tended to do better economically we in the west have a narrative that involves the development of individual reason and conscience during the renaissance and the enlightenment and then the subsequent flourishing of capitalism according to this narrative societies get more individualistic as they develop
3395814 scientists have delighted to show that so called rational choice is shaped by a whole range of subconscious influences like emotional contagions and priming effects people who think of a professor before taking a test do better than people who think of a criminal meanwhile human brains turn out to be extremely permeable they naturally mimic the neural firings of people around them relationships are the key to happiness people who live in the densest social networks tend to flourish while people who live with few social bonds are much more prone to depression and suicide
3395815 the rise of china isnt only an economic event its a cultural one the ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the american dream its certainly a useful ideology for aspiring autocrats

3395837 it has nothing to with real life nothing to do with justice its politics and politicians
3395838 the question is now do you just not give a shit anymore about telling the truth
3395839 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it

3395845 she was a bit more shy than some of the other kids and very much enjoys time on her own
3395846 but when shes with the artery program shes a totally different kid not shy very outgoing and bubbly
3395847 i think its her way of communicating she connects to it and shannon and jane love it so much that its sort of their communication they all understand each other
3395848 so this is a great opportunity for some one on one interaction and the art has really been helpful for expressing how youre feeling and its an emotional outlet for her
3395849 they want to stay in their room but they still need to have those activities that relate to their life outside of bloorview so painting oh i paint at home and it makes me feel like im at home weve heard this comment several times
3395850 were not art therapists and we dont have therapeutic goals
3395851 its really to give the children an enhanced experience in the hospital to remind them what its like to be healthy the normalcy of their life when theyre institutionalized they dont have choices but the arts program offers them choices
3395852 ive actually learned how to do more art since i came to bloorview
3395853 a lot of the kids cognitively are not able to really discern this and that but they can smell
3395854 and of course those that i cannot really connect with cognitively its a matter of trying to find what affects them in a pleasant way
3395855 i am an outdoor gal im a farm gal from way back and to know that if i was in a setting like this that was devoid of fresh life i think it would be very difficult for me
3395856 as robots enter our everyday life they need to have sensors everywhere on their bodies like humans

3395866 this stunning technology does appear to be a revolutionary leap forward in rendering technology
3395867 this is something they should have done a long time ago
3395868 its important that we as partners emphasize to cisco the need to keep small business as a unique label that doesnt allow enterprise providers to come down into the small business space
3395869 we run our business based on councils one for enterprise one for service provider one for commercial and now one for smb
3395870 we are establishing a new level of leadership in terms of smb
3395871 now we can really separate ourselves from the home products line and we can leverage the cisco name
3395872 a lot of people think of linksys as the wireless router they have at home
3395873 for partners focused on small business there is tremendous opportunity for all to gain market share
3395874 you have these partners that are putting home class stuff into businesses
3395875 if youre committed to the small business space its a different skill set because you are not dealing with an it staff you have to understand their business needs and not just sell a piece of technology
3395876 when i sell five of a particular phone system in a year thats a good year for us
3395877 linksys has been really good about supporting its products with cisco you have to have a bunch of letters after your name to get support
3395878 what i am hoping is that they will keep the prices where they need to be and not just charge that extra price on the brand
3395879 linksys partners are going to get an email and then a phone call in the next week or two to simply walk them through a process that should take 20 minutes
3395880 we run our business based on councils one for enterprise one for service provider one for commercial and now one for smb

3395942 china still does not have a generation system for organs does still not have a law allowing for the sourcing of organs from a brain dead cardiac alive it still does not have a national organ distribution and sharing system its still the overwhelming 90 95 96 per cent of its organs are sourced from prisoners

3395954 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment
3395955 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3395956 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3395957 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3395958 i became aware that kris could qualify for scotland a few months ago
3395959 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest
3395960 he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched
3395961 i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability he is a naturally left sided winger and maybe we have lacked width in the squad
3395962 i spoke to the boy and he was keen and enthusiastic to join the squad
3395963 we feel we have done nothing wrong we registered the player and he filled in the form properly
3395964 the ifa have held their hands up and admitted their mistake i am sure it will be overturned
3395965 we spoke to the ifa the day before the match and they gave clearance on the forms which we submitted we got the go ahead
3395966 on tuesday we were told there was a mistake on the form because the player was still registered with another club
3395967 to find the balance between the old soviet union system and this freedom is not easy
3395968 you have to give him credit for hiring the polar opposite of what had been in the soviet union for all these years
3395969 it was almost like being the army you have to do this and this and this you lived in a camp you practice two or three times a day you just followed the orders you were always under such pressure
3395970 but now the situation has changed russian players make good money and that can be poison to our system the national team doesnt pay money its just pride and this is all over the world its not easy to build this program
3395971 that was the choice it was easy to manage those teams
3395972 i didnt like when somebody treated me badly i would get so pissed off i dont like when people humiliate me it was the style of the coach and it would make me mad all the time
3395973 me i always dreamed of being with a coach who can be my friend out of the business out in life we can talk we can exchange some jokes blatts like this
3395974 i am an american israeli jewish guy who is being called by the former enemy to coach their national team
3395975 some people wouldve hesitated and some people see it as some form of disloyalty that to me is ridiculous
3395976 that kind of talk that kind of ethnocentrism doesnt help anybody to me its malicious and unacceptable me being in russia with my background does more for relations between people than anybody sitting at home coaching their own team and never stepping outside their own world
3395977 it depends what youre in it for i guess but im in it because its a global game and the world is changing and anything that can bring people together is just an enormous benefit
3395978 every day im talking to our people my staff guys who understand the situation ive got to tell you im more uncomfortable around the georgians than the russians this is not a good time right now

3395994 i need to see you about that allied account we need to get some information to corporate
3395995 who gave you the right the permission the clearance the verification and insinuation that you are free who did this who taught you to read it was against the law and you are too obtuse to understand the meaning of these words yet you insist on speaking them yet you insist on looking me in the eye and demanding that i address you by your name who do you think you are and who let you in here i said who let you in here where the sign said niggers and women need not apply

3396005 be ordinary be happy with what you have do not question do not fight back do not lift your head its not worth it punks jump up to get beat down and we will beat you down with clubs and fists if necessary nooses and crosses aflame because you need to know your places

3396023 this is not protest against land transfer in fact this is anger against india
3396024 i see this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through a bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace proces will not be very positive
3396025 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation nor do they contribute to creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3396026 every year thousands of men are operated on without sufficient scientific evidence that the surgery will have any impact
3396027 there have been dozens of observational studies published showing a positive effect however high quality randomized trials were not able to confirm these positive conclusions
3396028 this review fails to offer evidence that treatment of varicoceles in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility improves the couples chances of pregnancy
3396029 treatment of varicoceles in men cannot be recommended the first do no harm principal should guide us as long as there is no evidence to the contrary
3396030 my suggestion for patients is to check for other factors that might impair fertility before treating the varicocele
3396031 varicoceles do not seem to decrease fertility or at least removing them doesnt seem to help dont concentrate on the wrong issue when there are other more important fertility factors present
3396032 not everyone with a varicocele is going to be infertile
3396033 treatment guidelines written by the american urological association and the american society of reproductive medicine suggest that only those with a varicocele that the physician could feel palpable and a documented sperm abnormality should be treated this review had studies that included men with normal semen parameters and very small or subclinical varicoceles
3396034 looking at all eight review studies the odds ratio that treatment would be successful was 1 1 indicating no benefit from the treatment
3396035 when including only those men who had palpable varicoceles and semen abnormalities the odds ratio doubled these improved results were reported despite a variety of therapies being used
3396036 these techniques may have different success and failure rates when developing a study design it may not be appropriate to mix treatment options together
3396037 im just a journeyman according to some people why should i have any hard feelings im just thankful to have this job i might pay bruce allen and jon gruden for bringing me back out here

3396039 im sure he aldridge regrets lashing out that way its an intense competition we expect them to line up in the world championships
3396040 he daley was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform i didnt blow anything so i can go home happy unfortunately its a partnership you both have to be on the top of your game i wasnt on top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his
3396041 neither of them dived their best but nobody made mistakes it sounds like sour grapes to me
3396042 this was blakes only competition and the games are finished for him i just hope he doesnt upset tom because he has another to deal with in 11 days his individual competition if he does he will have me to deal with

3396061 im in the camp that argues oils bull run has been demand based up through 2007 demand in the u s rose but this year weve seen a decrease in demand particularly in gasoline consumption as the price went over 4 per gallon
3396062 some tried to argue that oil was decoupled from gasoline demand and from u s demand in general but that thesis is being discredited almost on a weekly basis
3396063 to imply that a pronounced u s economic slowdown and the accompanying reduction in global commerce would not slow energy use was incorrect
3396064 part of the fun and challenge of painting rooms for older children is involving them in the process it is nice to know a childs favorite colors temperament style and so on i try to find a happy balance between parents and children parents might appreciate that theres a place to hang artwork or pictures from school kids love a border that makes them smile i try to use patterns low on the walls when painting childrens room since they appreciate a view chalkboards and bulletin boards add utility to a room and are great for collecting photographs and messages from friends and relations personalizing the room in these ways does much to give a child a sense of belonging

3396087 the sad reality is that there are churches and church leaders that grossly misrepresent jesus christ through their lives and teaching but are those experiences really what hold us back from the local church
3396088 the church community is where we learn to love god and others where we are strengthened and transformed by truth from the word where were taught to pray to worship and to serve where we can be most certain that were investing our time and abilities for eternity where we can grow in our roles as friends sons and daughters husbands and wives fathers and mothers
3396089 if jesus loves the church you and i should too we cant use the excuse that the church has messed up too many times that were disillusioned jesus is the only person who has the right to disown and give up on the church but he never has and he never will
3396090 consider the countless women and men since acts not great leaders or teachers or pastors mind you just ordinary believers who have lived their lives for gods glory in local churches how many do we know now by name hardly any and yet their faithfulness to the savior is directly connected to the fact that two thousand years later you and i know jesus if they had now stood for the gospel in their generation we wouldnt be here in ours
3396091 i think china is changed irrevocably after these 17 days it is a full aware part of the international community and they know that their behavior in that community is going to have to be different than in the past

3396093 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3396094 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3396095 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3396096 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3396097 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3396098 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3396099 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3396100 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3396101 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3396102 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3396103 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3396104 de politiek laat zich steeds afleiden door onzin en prietpraat
3396105 jonathan trained all his life for the job he was doing loved what he did died doing what he loved he was well respected
3396106 he always led from the front inspiring others to follow and with his operational background and determination to make a difference was ideally suited to the demands of helmand province
3396107 an absolute professional he was courageous reliable to the core and unwaveringly loyal to all
3396108 jon was described to me by his family as a fun loving character who was loved by all his friends and family
3396109 he was a caring man who was well respected by all the soldiers who served with him
3396110 he would always lead by example and sacrifice his comforts for those of his men this inevitably endeared him to the other soldiers
3396111 he was popular well respected and a pleasure to have under command
3396112 he was a man i could always depend on sgt mathews completed all tasks with equal passion
3396113 having been involved in numerous contacts with sgt mathews i would confidently place my life in his hands as i so often had to knowing that he would look after all of us
3396114 i will always think of him as a real gentleman soldier and i will miss the banter
3396115 he was hard and aggressive in battle but compassionate and thoughtful when required
3396116 i know your hearts are broken but your hearts are also bursting with pride
3396117 one thing that always sticks in my mind and he should be commended for is his kindness and compassion to both soldiers below and above him
3396118 he loved being the family man and was in his element when he was with shona william and meghan
3396119 rest in peace jon you were a true gentleman a great friend and you will never be forgotten
3396120 he was a keen family man and very popular as you can see by the appearance of all the people here

3396123 managing in a down economy survival techniques of global retailers
3396124 nobody but nobody was speaking english its all italian dutch french german and heavy heavy russian the europeans are absolutely the biggest retail customers these days downtown and they are spending like crazy
3396125 partnership between local retailers and the tourism industry in a major shopping event like the september shopfest can further push both industries to higher levels
3396126 this is a social object its not only my thing its my graphic but how this graphic got famous its the social power the twitter power
3396127 the wireless network appears to have been compromised and will be disabled for about a minute
3396128 but when they are baked mealworms have a very nutty flavor i put them in my chocolate chip cookies
3396129 either they eat the bug or they dont but i like to think of it as a longer process show people that they are operating with a really closed mind and get people thinking and if you do that you never know what is going to happen with those seeds
3396130 humanity is acting like it can do whatever it wants forever
3396131 they have a waxy coating that many find bitter david george gordon recommends soaking the roaches in lemon juice to cut that flavor

3396133 tv one is so excited to be presenting the first off network run of the the pjs to our viewers
3396134 its so weird driving around america its the same guns n roses song
3396135 its like cant you play a deep cut something that wasnt a hit or some band people have never heard before just something man i think theyre underestimating people they think were too dumb to understand that if something wasnt a hit that doesnt mean its not good lets make radio important again lets not make it dumb lets not make it mcdonalds
3396136 the program was born from our brands desire to do something meaningful surrounding music
3396137 non commercial radio is not pay to play is not influenced by outside sources i e cash from advertisers and is a shining example of an environment created for and by fans of music djs who get excited about bringing new music to their audiences will continue to push new sounds forward and inspire the listeners to discover something they might not have found on their own
3396138 the campaign itself seemed to be managed in a smart way
3396139 they seemed to understand that independent radio is important and they wanted to help and we just wanted to get on board with that
3396140 i think stations like prb are so rare on the dial
3396141 and if you dont do things like this the people who already know are gonna keep on listening and love it but as this generation grows up and kids find other media outlets this is something people might ignore as time goes on that can happen if you dont go out and try to approach people and proactively make an impact and throw events and get people excited theres a million other ways for people to find stuff they might be interested in but independent radio especially great programming like we have might get lost in the shuffle if we dont do things like this every once in a while
3396142 its so important to maintain stations specific to the city its in and the people there and the vibe the scene and not cave to one company owning a hundred stations across america and playing the same thing and not caring about whats going on locally
3396143 toyotas a brand thats never really had any passion points behind it its always been very reliable good gas mileage a good value and so our buyer base skews older
3396144 we want to connect with the youth more and we know that we have a very young group of buyers that look to toyota for the prius and definitely want to share in our eco stance but oftentimes cant afford the cost of the prius so when we were bringing out this yaris vehicle which gets very good gas mileage and is affordable we knew this group would probably be very interested in it so not only did we go for the demographic we wanted to go a little deeper and that led us into the independent music realm
3396145 when you step into this realm and youre a company like toyota the first thing any person thinks of is like why is this corporate giant in here and rightly so there have been so many corporations that have come into different scenes and blatantly market to it and bastardize what they have ill never allow us to come in and do what so many corporate entities have done and ruin a scene i think its awful ive been snowboarding for like 19 years i was one of those young punk kids at the beginning who saw so many companies try to buy their way into it and i was able to see the backlash from people who felt like those corporations were making a joke out of the things they loved so were just trying to find a more authentic way to fuel young peoples passions and support the roots of independent music which are these independent radio stations in the process were very non forcefully trying to introduce them to vehicles we know theyre interested in and just do things the right way so theyll look at us in a little more positive light and maybe as they become a new car buyer that will be a consideration
3396146 we havent felt any pressure we havent been asked to do anything that we wouldnt want to do we havent been asked to put up toyota stickers or do ads for urban outfitters or anything like that theyre very hands off weve been given freedom to promote this the way we want and organize the show the way we want and theres really very little influence from the corporate side of things
3396147 in general the findings of the assessment indicated that the overall food security situation in the drought affected areas has not improved
3396148 failed rains in the south in october and november during the belg season led to crop failure

3396151 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3396152 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3396153 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3396154 most of us fled from kumisar afdub rebo omar don and dhur dher locations in kalafe district of the somali region of ethiopia

3396156 it seems the international community forgot us when siad barre was overthrown

3396195 if the picture you see in the windshield isnt what you want it to be do what ever is necessary to make it right dont over think it do it if the airplane is drifting to the left as seen in the windshield do the natural thing lean into the wind by dropping that wing then since part of any landing in any airplane tailwheel or otherwise should be to keep the tail lined up behind the nose as the nose tries to move off the centerline you use what ever rudder is necessary to keep it there which is usually surprise surprise opposite to the aileron youre holding dont think about it do it

3396209 there are three ways to fund campaigns and none of them is very good
3396210 you can have rich friends you can have support from special interests pacs and lobbyists or you can fund a campaign yourself this race has all three but money cannot buy elections they are won by leg work by going door to door and by demonstrating that you can turn ideas into action
3396211 weve really come back from my initial position clearly third place to where we are right there neck and neck coming down the line

3396229 the decision is basically a formalisation of the reality because unmee has really not been on the ground
3396230 both countries do not want to go to war but the situation is very sensitive and the troops are close to each other
3396231 the mission was sent at the request of both countries to keep the peace after a two year war claimed at least 70 000 ethiopian and eritrean lives
3396232 it was a difficult mission in geographically harsh locations but the men and women who served did not flinch
3396233 the secretary general expresses hope that the parties would be able to break the current stalemate and create conditions necessary for the normalisation of their relations which is key to peace and stability in the region
3396234 ethiopia has a firm stand that the conflict between ethiopia and eritrea ought to be solved through peaceful means
3396235 unmees presence was really symbolic it was not a peace enforcement force it does not have the capability of deterrent so its not going to have any impact
3396236 legally ethiopias occupation of eritrea is untenable it cannot be accepted by the international community i think our focus has been on the legal end and the diplomatic dimensions of the issue
3396237 both regimes have used it as an excuse to enhance their domestic power at the expense of democracy and economic growth thus reducing the attractiveness to them of diplomatic compromise
3396238 they support the others domestic rebels and each is convinced that the fall of the others regime is imminent and the only real solution to the border dispute

3396267 the opening ceremony is sending the same message then as the games architecture cultural and technological leapfrog the water cube and the birds nest dont simply display chinas modernity they claim a jump into a digital sustainable mega scaled future the computational aesthetics of multiplicity that mark these structures are again like the opening ceremony a powerful cultural narrative coherence strength and beauty made of countless tiny pieces like the flickering grid of the drummers the ordered diversity of these structures is important too in that its not total uniformity a simple modernist grid in fact these buildings contain a kind of post industrial grid where the uniformity or regularity is not literal or material but procedural or computational the computers ability to resolve complex distributions of force is what enables the organic multiplicity here
3396268 the stark videos of brandon morse present the viewer with exercises in tension set tableaux in which structures morph and twist under physical constraints stripped down architectural forms that ought to exhibit the rigidity of highrise buildings instead engage in a tug of war the result of a string simulation distributing kinetic force through a network of nodes

3396353 believe another major financial services firm will fail as a result of the ongoing crisis in global markets and they expect it to happen sooner rather than later
3396354 if you are looking for a silver lining in these findings it seems that most institutions think we are currently in the most dangerous period for global financial services firms

3396370 i dont think the result is because japans was a fantastic performance
3396371 after 3 1 down we got the message that the united states was three or four goals up and we needed a get a point in order to win the group

3396376 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3396377 i dont think theres any harm in nominating sen clinton at the convention
3396378 it will acknowledge the success we had and it will give an opportunity for people to express themselves and get behind obama and win in november
3396379 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3396380 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3396381 if the situation were reversed the obama people would feel the same
3396382 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3396383 sen clinton is going to do everything she can to make sure sen obama is the next president and that will include how the convention is handled and the role she plays
3396384 polls out there show that older women are the potential swing demographic in this election
3396385 it helps obama and the party to have her play a prominent role in the convention
3396386 if a candidates got delegates then both names can be placed in nomination
3396387 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had

3396392 the bush administration yesterday proposed a regulatory overhaul of the endangered species act to allow federal agencies to decide whether protected species would be imperiled by agency projects eliminating the independent scientific reviews that have been required for more than three decades
3396393 if approved the changes would represent the biggest overhaul of endangered species regulations since 1986 they would accomplish through rules what conservative republicans have been unable to achieve in congress ending some environmental reviews that developers and other federal agencies blame for delays and cost increases on many projects

3396407 as an african american i was always taught to associate the confederacy with oppression
3396408 you have to respect that people fought for what they thought was right
3396409 it is our clear position and this position is strengthened after the russian violations that it was a big mistake made by allies that georgia and ukraine did not get the membership action plan in bucharest
3396410 we think russia got this message as a green light and mostly the recent steps we have in the territory of georgia come from this mistake
3396411 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
3396412 i think that the bucharest communique stands the allies have said in bucharest that one day georgia will join nato

3396415 none of the ministers are able to leave the capital right now
3396416 to come here and lose in the first round like this it aint right man it dont seem real to me
3396417 every day every week every month even years that ive been working so hard for this and i came this far to lose in the first round again im not saying i failed myself but it should be the right scoring the scoring should be fair to everybody
3396418 i didnt really know the score because it was so much going on in the crowd everybody was yelling and screaming
3396419 i was looking at some of my teammates and it sounded like they were saying move and some were just saying fight i thought i was up i thought i was up because i was scoring evidently i was down
3396420 raushee hit him he got a point twice and twice raushee threw punches and scored he also got points that determined the outcome of the fight
3396421 ill call the technical adviser and the people who were watching this away from the ring and see what they say ill trust the judgment of the technical adviser and anything i say id rather say based on what he saw as opposed to what i saw sitting at the ring
3396422 for him to lose it could be disheartening for some of our other guys
3396423 thats going to be our biggest fear i think theyre most definitely going to be psyched out we have a psychologist around and were going to make sure she talks to the team im sure all of them are going to be psyched out

3396426 the situation of the urban poor has worsened they are now getting more vulnerable it is no longer just the old caseload of drought affected people the urban poor need assistance as they continue to be adversely affected by rising food prices
3396427 this is in addition to funds already being used to feed the hungry in the region
3396428 the food and livelihood crisis in somalia is already critical after very poor rains in the southern and central parts of the country this year combined with violence and limited or no access to the affected populations
3396429 the emergency is exacerbated by the erosion of livelihoods among the landless pastoralists internally displaced persons and the urban poor across the regions disease outbreaks fuelled by poor hygiene and sanitation in drought affected areas and poor health and nutrition services including low immunisation coverage are additional high risks for mothers and children
3396430 at the same time inflation has reached 26 6 percent
3396431 a main driver behind the price rise is the drop in food production caused by post election displacement in january and february 2008 mainly in the highly food productive rift valley province
3396432 that number may increase following the long rains assessment underway now
3396433 overall kenya faces an overall food deficit this year because of post election violence that disrupted production and high fertiliser and fuel prices
3396434 there is a serious concern that a third consecutive year of widespread crop failure could afflict the region which is fast approaching a worst case food security scenario
3396435 the combination of drought and the knock on effect of global food price increases could affect a significant portion of the population

3396441 everyone was saying that this team is not even going to make it to the second day we read all that yeah we did
3396442 we sat up in the computer lab and said we cant believe theyre writing this stuff we always knew at the least that we would be a team that would be in position to be looking at a medals podium
3396443 we talked every night we never stopped believing in ourselves
3396444 as far as im concerned this is gold for us
3396445 i said you guys this meet has been great regardless of what happens
3396446 i told them that i loved them no matter what happens
3396447 its every single tear shed and all the toil in my life the emotional heartbreaks it all seems worth it now
3396448 and theres my knee and im favoring my bad left ankle with my bad right leg which is where i had my knee surgery
3396449 i never would have expected it just a few weeks ago
3396450 personally i exceeded all my goals here today what a tremendous honor to be up on the podium at the olympic games
3396451 theres a pond outside our village lillies full of algae its pretty gross
3396452 we told ourselves that if we medal were going swimming in that pond
3396453 everyone was saying that this team is not even going to make it to the second day we read all that yeah we did
3396454 we sat up in the computer lab and said we cant believe theyre writing this stuff we always knew at the least that we would be a team that would be in position to be looking at a medals podium

3396463 theres a pond outside our village lillies full of algae its pretty gross

3396466 an inside com alum who is reviving the online destination as part of an overall expansion
3396467 get the money because otherwise they are going to kill me
3396468 you have to look at it as services that are being offered to a community who needs them because legally people cannot qualify to enter the country
3396469 no one wants to risk their lives in order to come through so if you could simply establish a system where people could enter flexibly you would deal a very strong blow to the smugglers but as the border has become more fortified smugglers have become increasingly more important they are a necessary evil
3396470 its not unusual for us to get three or four calls a week
3396471 where were responding and going into places that are basically housing between 15 to 30 individuals who have been smuggled we get a lot of call outs and we do a lot of federal prosecutions
3396472 over the six months of our intervention our medical teams could only work for 10 weeks in fiiq town and five on the periphery of the town where the most important needs are
3396473 they might have their own double agenda otherwise there was no intimidation or administrative hurdles from our side
3396474 if there was intimidation they would not have stayed for the last six months
3396475 in addition over the past six months msf mobile teams have only been able to give medical consultations to 677 patients in the most affected rural area around fiiq while many more patients would have been expected
3396476 the authorities attitude towards humanitarian organisations has translated into recurrent arrests of msf switzerland staff without charge or explanation
3396477 despite continuous attempts to improve the working relations with the authorities our organisation can only regret the absence of any room to bring independent and impartial assistance
3396478 the region has a right to monitor whether they conduct their operations according to the agreement they reached but they do not want our close monitoring
3396479 five national staff of msf are in detention we do not know the reasons behind their arrest but if a citizen is found to be a criminal a government has a right to arrest them

3396488 he was one of those guys who would say he wanted to bang you but when he was sober and suggested you do it to jeff buckley and never call you again he was one of those im so versed in the ways of the asshole
3396489 im amazed at how sticking things out here thru all the shit has really paid off cha ching the struggle has yielded victory just not in matters of the heart or vag or mind
3396490 all your ex boyfriends now i swear have like tits you pull all the man straight out of their penis with your fucking vagina and turn them lame
3396491 sorry i puked all over your bathroom ill totally make you t shirts
3396492 hey i think you are a little tooo hot in those pants maybe you need to take those off
3396493 im tired of astro turf and poo lets listen to the human league only we could be listening to the human league in all our cars at the same time i think we are obsessed
3396494 thank you you just saved me from many seriously awkward sexual encounters
3396495 if you are going to invite goth boys over the house they have to be beaten i think its like a rule
3396496 the grow er is the transformer penis the show er is the deceptacon
3396497 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3396498 our message to speaker pelosi is very simple we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve if you meant what you said last night we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy end your five week break early and call congress back into session now so we can vote for more american made energy and lower gas prices without any further delay
3396499 the lone new england republican in the house stood in the chamber of the recessed congress where the lights are low and microphones are off until the session resumes in september and demanded that the democratic majority come back to the capitol and allow a debate on energy policy
3396500 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding
3396501 house republicans have already made our position clear a position that includes remaining on the floor of the u s house to demand a genuine debate and straightforward vote on the most important issue facing americans today despite what we heard last night the speakers position is far from clear but she could clear that up by bringing the house back into session and working with republicans to pass a serious energy plan to bring down prices at the pump
3396502 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3396503 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3396504 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3396505 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3396506 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3396507 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3396508 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3396509 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3396510 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3396511 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3396512 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3396513 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3396514 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3396515 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3396516 i beg you to forgive me how can i make it up to you
3396517 im happy to be in the big apple the windy city nanjing one of chinas three furnaces of hot weather hangzhou by the beautiful west lake at the haier company chinas biggest maker of home appliances
3396518 you make some excellent points rosemary and i wish that everybody were as concerned about the issue as you are and i appreciate the call
3396519 i believe that rosemary has a bumper sticker that says visualize world peace
3396520 he does it because hes in pain from the injuries he got as a prisoner of war his hands hurt constantly so he rubs them together
3396521 were worried that the funds money is actually relatively expensive
3396522 they say theyve checked and countries can afford to take on more debt well maybe they can this time but if this is going to carry on can they afford to take on more debt in the future so we say that the fund should make its lending cheaper
3396523 youve got a payment holiday for 10 years and then you have 40 years to repay the loan and theres no interest rate
3396524 so that tells you how relatively expensive fund money is in comparison if the fund wants to be a serious player in doing something about the food crisis it needs to make its money cheaper
3396525 the scale of the aftershocks really threatens to derail macro economic stability and efforts to achieve the mdgs millennium development goals
3396526 they need good policy options and they need help from the international community their challenge is ours it is to ensure adequate food supplies while preserving the poverty reducing benefits derived in recent years from faster growth low inflation and better budget and balance of payments positions
3396527 theyre the imf looking at balance of payments and cash reserves and theyre worried about the fact that rising prices are going to cause a serious balance of payments problem and cash flow problem for some of these countries and that it might be so severe that they might not be able to import what they need and i think thats quite reasonable
3396528 but we think the fund should automatically offer extra money under the terms of the loan agreement you shouldnt have to wait for a review by the board you should offer it automatically to any country that is suffering from the food crisis in some ways the funds moving quickly but it needs to move more quickly still
3396529 clearly when countries are coming into this sort of crisis they need more space
3396530 what about past policies that dismantled lots of mechanisms that would allow countries to deal with the food crisis things like dismantling buffer stocks and privatising state marketing boards there were some kinds of safety nets that were built into the system and the world bank and the fund have in the past been part of getting rid of those

3396540 its been hard for me to look at someone who claims to be a prophet of the lord ive chosen not to go to church at this time
3396541 spirit was broken and she was reluctant to go to church
3396542 she looked me up and down and said i guess you want me to apologize i can but it wont be sincere

3396548 undergraduate courses are usually the last chance we get to help citizens and future leaders understand the nature of science and the importance of stem to our lives as individuals and as members of the larger society
3396549 we cant emphasize enough how important it is to improve education at this level

3396552 early in our history wed used space at the walnut street theatre and then at st stephens later we looked at 75 buildings all over the place not just in downtown philly but from the beginning we knew what we wanted was complete flexibility so that the theater could be conformed differently and in a sense the shows themselves could dictate how the space was used every other decision came from that and the fact that we were able to incorporate a second performance space was a wonderful piece of luck
3396553 we loved the space but had outgrown it we were afraid of going backward we needed to offer more than just great plays we needed more amenities greater comfort for patrons more bathrooms we wanted state of the art technology and additional public spaces a black box a caf area
3396554 it would allow me to use the full orchestra and to have real choreography we might be able to work with 600 seats thats 200 more than we have in our home theater but we certainly couldnt fill 1 800 theres no way we could make that work
3396555 we can now do our own versions of current plays performed with more immediacy
3396556 is in a sense completely tied to the death of the pre broadway tryout system
3396557 jack merriam a uarts trustee and real estate developer made it possible for us to acquire the shubert he arranged for his estate to pay off the building uarts rechristened the theater in his name
3396558 we always talk about the legacy of the building i like to stand onstage and remind everybody of what has been here before from a theater geek point of view its a huge thrill
3396559 also to find the right material we alternate musicals and plays and its easier to find the former this theater was designed at a time when some plays had casts of 30 or 35 people
3396560 we dont have a publicity mechanism to bring in huge audiences so we open only the orchestra level
3396561 the merriam is available on a rental basis and we bring in all kinds of things the pennsylvania ballet has used it they need the large orchestra pit weve had chinese acrobats and concerts by mandy patinkin also plays and musicals on what was historically called the chitlin circuit
3396562 thats what it all comes down to its indefinable but its there
3396563 i loved it and still love it theres something perfect almost sacred about the dimensions the size and shape of the proscenium perfect proportions and acoustics
3396564 the city has given a grant for a new sound system
3396565 1812 productions did a show here last year and will do two next season maybe its the beginning of a relationship we also want to continue as a nonprofessional community theater were the only one in downtown philly
3396566 the barrymores didnt appear here john drew certainly didnt the theater wasnt even built yet
3396567 in those days im not sure how enthusiastically they would have embraced catholics
3396568 a bar on the third floor and a large club space were open for rentals
3396569 theres another important vote on august 8 if the historical commission votes in favor then the boyd will be protected from demolition
3396570 twenty years ago i walked in and couldnt believe how beautiful it was yet there was a sign on the door that it was marked for demolition i was horrified i joined the theatre historical society of america and went across the country to see how other theaters had been saved
3396571 were planning to continue to accommodate films and wed love to see it used for hollywood style premi res and occasional special engagements
3396572 we met with several different parties interested in purchasing restoring and reopening the boyd whoever acquires it will still need rehabilitation funding to get it back on line
3396573 philly has to do a much better job than were doing right now its ridiculous that we have so many magnificent theaters that are just sitting unused
3396574 artists of roberts stature make transitions that is their nature i feel loss and discouragement but i also feel anxious to find out what robert will cook up next mum is dead long live mum
3396575 it can only be for good if we get rid of obvious mistakes
3396576 but when it comes to his record american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain
3396577 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3396578 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3396579 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture

3396592 how many people should die before you say the situation is out of control
3396593 if one person died due to the drought the situation is already out of control
3396594 during such times the government should move on all fronts the government budget should also be readjusted
3396595 actions and policies are needed now to avert grave human suffering
3396596 in areas of ethiopia drought and conflict are leaving millions food insecure and often cut off from relief the government estimates that 75 000 children are severely malnourished
3396597 we are in a race against time as we try to bring in enough supplies to save lives
3396598 already affected communities in ethiopia are taking extreme measures to survive
3396599 families are selling household items farm tools and even wood and tin sheets from the frames and roofs of their homes to buy food many are also taking their children out of school and are hunting for wild plants to eat
3396600 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3396601 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3396602 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3396603 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3396604 heres someone to care about you to like you and love you even if you dont deserve it
3396605 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3396606 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3396607 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3396608 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3396609 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3396610 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3396611 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3396612 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3396631 good morals precede good laws which is why government isnt much help
3396632 john adams put it well when he said we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion
3396633 our founders had a better answer than government or even education god is the answer god is the moral compass of america or he should be if we ever want to restore morality in our homes and civility to our land our founders believed morals flowed from ones accountability to god and that without god immoral anarchy would result

3396691 it was a total surprise to realize that its not something i can earn or deserve but its something that christ gave as a gift and by faith you accept that and the good deeds that you do are because you love jesus and have a relationship with him not because you have a religion thats news to people in this area
3396692 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side
3396693 i expected it on the religious side but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists

3396714 the largescale influx of illegal migrants has led to large tracts of sensitive borders which have serious implication for internal security
3396715 the influx of bangladeshi nationals who have illegally migrated poses a threat to the integrity and security of india the frro is duty bound to take all necessary measure
3396716 the order of deportation is not a punishment but a method of ensuring the return to own country of an alien who has not complied with conditions hence bangladeshi nationals who have migrated illegally have no right to remain in india and they are liable to be deported
3396717 on account of variety of reasons including religious and economic it is difficult to make a realistic estimate of the number of illegal migrants

3396721 my feeling is that we have to dampen the fire rather than raising it i would sacrifice myself anytime rather than see innocent people being sacrificed
3396722 the board was made for better management of yatra and is governed by good people the bigger complaint is that all of them should be local but i believe majority should be locals but you should have people from outside also

3396732 each super threat on its own poses a serious challenge to the worlds adaptive capacity
3396733 acting together the five super threats may irreversibly overwhelm our species ability to survive
3396734 previous geas simulations with significantly less data and cross validation correctly forecasted the most surprising species collapses of the past decade sciurus carolinenis and sciurus vulgaris for example and anatidae chen so we have very good reason to believe that these simulation results while shocking do accurately represent the rapidly growing threats to the viability of the human species
3396735 we are grateful for geas work and we treat their latest forecast with seriousness and profound gravity
3396736 the new xc60 is being priced specified and marketed with a view to building robust long term residual values
3396737 this will help create a significant corporate customer base as well as appeal to the growing numbers of retail customers now assessing whole life costs before making a purchase the data and analysis from eurotaxglasss has been critical in shaping key elements of our fleet marketing programme across europe
3396738 the larger xc90 has returned very good residual values since its launch and we feel the xc60 will continue in this same vein the 4x4 market has been under pressure from used prices falling for a while but the xc60 is a premium product with very modern styling and a good level of standard specification so we are confident of its success as a used car
3396739 the official test regime is too simplistic to embrace all the vagaries of real world operating conditions and it allows certain types of car to look good too good in fact
3396740 the batch of cars that we tested all claim to have green credentials but they are not as environmentally friendly or as economical as weve been led to believe
3396741 manufacturers argue that the official tests offer a level playing field that enables potential car buyers to make direct comparisons but they bear little relation to real world driving the official figures are misleading and i cant see manufacturers calling for a change because they know the current tests make their cars look more fuel efficient and cleaner than they are

3396767 however for many customers the relatively high cost of a hybrid is an obstacle to actually purchasing one together with its partners daimler is investing in this pilot project in order to find out how economical the hybrid is for customers in comparison with conventional drive systems and to optimize product development with regard to customers requirements

3396784 many of the protestors were from outside the village and in fact senior republicans from belfast were present and were part of an intimidating crowd that stood on the main street
3396785 no doubt sinn fein will try to tell us that they were there to keep control well if that was the case they failed
3396786 the protestors revealed their real agenda by displaying placards with the words pride of the maine not welcome here a reference to the band that was leading the parade
3396787 a child was hit with a stone that was thrown by republicans and attempts were made to provoke a reaction from the band members and apprentice boys thankfully with no success
3396788 republicans do not have a problem with protestant and unionist parades but with many of the bands who march along with them and have a bad record of behaviour in rasharkin

3396795 according to my estimate we may get above 90 percent which confirms that the decision to sell is really a decision of the majority
3396796 the interest in the pse is there and since the prague bourse is relatively small shareholders decided that they will sell
3396797 keeping vehicles on the road with minimal interruptions for maintenance and repairs is everyones priority and with elements we have introduced a comprehensive choice of services to suit any commercial vehicle application
3396798 weve also created a more flexible and cost efficient product and given dealers and operators the flexibility to select any combination from the five major elements which make up the new offering with service levels each priced and customised to suit varying operators needs
3396799 this effectively allows customers to define exactly how much support they want from a planned maintenance contract and ensures we have a package to suit every iveco customer as an example in the past weve had operators which only wanted a contract to cover their pmis whereas other fleets have wanted a contract to cover routine servicing but not pmis with the launch of elements we can meet all of these requirements and a whole lot more

3396903 the petrol fg falcon sedan range has been judged by ancap as being the safety leader amongst locally manufactured vehicles cementing fords long standing reputation for safety leadership in australia
3396904 we design our cars to deliver real world safety benefits for our customers this result is a resounding third party endorsement of the extensive safety development program undertaken for the all new fg falcon
3396905 not only is the fg falcon the safest vehicle ever produced in this country it is also competitive with the safest sedans in the world
3396906 these safety test results add further validation to the extensive crash simulation process and physical crash test program conducted by ford australia for the fg falcon which was the most comprehensive in the companys history
3396907 consumers are more aware of the importance of vehicle safety than ever before
3396908 as the company that first made drive airbags standard and introduced stability control beltminder dual stage airbags and a reverse camera on australian built vehicles anticipating these growing consumer demands for increased safety was a top priority during the development of the all new falcon
3396909 the extensive range of active safety features including dynamic stability control calibrated for different driving styles based on model choice traction control and abs brakes ensures that accidents are avoided wherever possible
3396910 however in the unfortunate incidence where an accident is unavoidable the comprehensive list of standard and optional passive safety features from the strengthened body structure through to curtain airbags and a seatbelt reminder system combine to reduce the impact and severity to all occupants
3396911 our vehicle safety team which is part of ford australias extensive virtual engineering department used state of the art crash simulation techniques to deliver an outstanding combination of real world safety improvements for falcon customers
3396912 the majority of consumers equate the safety of their vehicle with visible features such as airbags stability control systems and brakes
3396913 while that combination of active and passive safety features is extremely important the true heart of crash safety is the design and strength of its passenger safety cell
3396914 the design of the structure and energy absorbing load paths the strength of the steel used and the positioning of the petrol tank all significantly contribute to reducing the likelihood of injury to occupants during a crash situation
3396915 highly technical door pressure sensors and dual upfront sensors provide earlier detection of potential crash incidents than ever before
3396916 no other australian built vehicle incorporates advanced crash sensors such as those on the new falcon detection of crash situations is instantaneous as the sensors literally hear the event occurring through pressure waves before the panels have even started to deform
3396917 importantly however they also provide enhanced discrimination between different types of events to determine the level of response required appropriate safety responses for each individual situation are then activated according to incident severity positioning of occupants and seat belt usage
3396918 the majority of people respond to friendly reminders and the percentage of people who steadfastly refuse to wear seat belts is very low
3396919 the extension of the beltminder system to front seat passengers will increase the acceptance of the reminder system even further and allow drivers to be sure that their front passenger is appropriately protected when the vehicle is moving
3396920 advances in simulation techniques and speed have supplemented the most comprehensive program of physical crash testing that has ever been undertaken at ford australia
3396921 cutting edge simulation enabled the team to accurately predict outcomes in advance of building the first prototype vehicles while the physical crash program has verified and enhanced the results expected
3396922 one of the real benefits of our crash simulation technology is that it allows us to freeze each virtual crash and view it from every possible angle while we assess the performance of the individual elements of the car
3396923 this would simply not have been possible with a physical test the ability to thoroughly examine every aspect of the vehicles safety performance so early in the development process allows us to fully optimise every possible aspect of the vehicles safety
3396924 the ability to model vehicle details with such incredible accuracy results in world class cae model fidelity and confidence for the physical vehicle build program
3396925 the turnaround time of each crash simulation is only four hours when implemented via our super computers to put that in context running the same simulation on a home pc would take approximately 18 months
3396926 despite the accuracy and speed advantages of improved cae technology a comprehensive physical crash test program is also an important element of vehicle production
3396927 at ford we test for 38 different types of full vehicle crash modes these tests include full frontal offset and side impact all at a variety of different speeds and vehicle load situations
3396928 our physical testing is one of the most thorough in the world with approximately 426 full vehicle representative tests undertaken for the fg program alone
3396929 subsystem and component tests allow us to investigate how individual elements of the vehicle react under a variety of different crash conditions this information is then fed back into the overall safety program to deliver an integrated vehicle result
3396930 consistently controlling temperature during physical crash tests is very important for the integrity of the results as it ensures that no outside forces can affect the repeatability of the results
3396931 there are only a few such facilities around the world that provide the same level of temperature control as fords detroit crash lab
3396932 superficially it changes as all things must but basically it remains the same
3396933 theyve pretty much told me that they are grooming me down here to pitch in the back end of the game up there

3396935 im gonna throw the nastiest curveball i have ever thrown if he hits it ill tip my cap but if not were going to the series
3396936 this is an excellent opportunity to learn and practice these new behaviors in a virtual environment and in real life
3396937 its also a great place to meet other avatars and share information and experiences
3396938 ubiquitous computing location aware systems rfid massive use of sensors smart devices using natural language to talk to devices workflows ways of merging reality and virtual reality and other technology ideas
3396939 we feel there is huge potential here well beyond health care or the groups we have touched so far
3396940 the project is really about the future world we will all live in where every object is a network object and humans can communicate with things as well as they do with each other

3396950 right if when the cubs actually do go to win the world series so they just keep picking it its a gamblers fallacy but it is no less annoying

3396976 im proud of him hes my son and playing on the same footy field was good greg said
3396977 that was the first time he had played at senior level he was up against men and he handled himself ok
3396978 i had confidence in him because i knew the job he could do and i knew he was going to do the job for me greg said
3396979 our communication level was good i think we talked more out on the field than we have at home for the past couple of weeks so if ive achieved nothing else ive achieved some communication with my son
3396980 it was just a spur of the moment thing we said lets go and we went ahead with it jay explained afterwards the milestone game was also jays comeback after he underwent a knee reconstruction 13 months ago following an injury playing for the storm sg ball side
3396981 it was good fun dad was plenty of help out there he was talking to me the whole game
3396982 i never really watched the games i was playing in the stands he said
3396983 i remember going on the field after the games and running around and all the fans cheering and stuff
3396984 its back to when i was 13 or 14 years old
3396985 my youngest boy nelson is 12 i dont think i will be hanging around to play with him he insisted
3396986 flo amp squo amp squo achieved what most dads only dream of playing in the same football side as his 18 year old son jay

3396993 he worked on the water treadmill yesterday and again this morning he also went for a walk around the caulfield course proper at the 600m he wanted to gallop then at the 400m he wanted to gallop again and was saying to his walker whats going on here

3396998 you have to draw from your own experiences what worked and didnt work but also look at the sides that have been successful against them and there havent been too many bolton said
3396999 so you do probably look at collingwood and see how they have gone against them we are going to have to have a really consistent effort from everyone and come up with a few things this week and there are a few things in the game plan that we can tinker with
3397000 coming into finals time this is when you want to be playing good football and it is good to get the chance to consolidate after last week
3397001 we are going to have to do a lot of things right bolton said of saturday nights virtual final
3397002 we have had a little bit of success over the past couple of years against geelong without getting across the line
3397003 they dont have any major weaknesses they have a really good backline and midfield and they have some quality forwards they dont rely on any one forward it makes it pretty difficult as a defence to plan coming up against a team like that
3397004 but we are looking forward to it i think we can beat them and weve got full confidence that we can do that at the same time we know it is going to be a really tough ask
3397005 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3397006 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3397007 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3397008 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3397009 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person
3397010 the escalation on the part of the russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3397011 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3397012 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3397013 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3397014 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3397015 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3397016 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3397017 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3397018 while not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most
3397019 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank
3397020 i always have a piece a day and i cant see that changing
3397021 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3397022 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3397023 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3397024 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3397025 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3397026 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3397027 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3397028 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3397029 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3397030 i think its so much you can do on the guitar

3397062 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3397063 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3397064 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3397065 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3397077 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
3397078 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
3397079 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
3397080 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
3397081 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
3397082 she would replace the cabins at camp david with cabanas and topless would be optional for all world leaders which would be horrifying but very european
3397083 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3397084 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3397091 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3397092 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3397093 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3397094 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3397095 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3397096 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3397097 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3397098 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3397099 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3397100 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3397101 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3397102 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3397103 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3397104 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3397105 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3397106 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3397107 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3397108 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3397109 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3397110 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3397111 the traxx fm merdeka road tour 2008 with jeff timmons of 98 degrees

3397113 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3397114 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3397115 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3397116 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3397117 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3397118 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3397119 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3397120 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3397121 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3397122 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3397123 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3397124 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3397125 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3397126 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3397127 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3397128 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3397129 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3397130 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things
3397131 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3397132 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3397133 we are celebrating the work done with autodesk maya over the past 10 years by many artists and creative visionaries in film television production and games as well as in industrial design and architecture
3397134 we designed maya 2009 as a tribute to creative innovation and production efficiency the new release will allow artists to raise the bar and deliver even more ground breaking computer graphics work
3397135 the future of maya is shining brightly with the upcoming release
3397136 autodesk maya 2009 will change the way artists think about dynamics rendering compositing and pipelines with the solid mental ray multi render pass workflow production will be far more effective this new workflow will optimize render times for multiple render layers and in turn elevate the quality of work the creation of nparticles builds on the unified dynamics engine introduced in ncloth allowing for greater integration of advanced effects
3397137 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3397138 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3397139 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3397140 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3397141 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3397142 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3397143 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3397144 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3397145 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3397146 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3397174 i always say you can learn from each other i have very valuable feedback from media players and the players association they all came with recommendations van der ende said
3397175 starting this season there will be a pre meeting before the games with coaches captains and referees
3397176 because otherwise maybe you get one coach saying with him he the referee takes five minutes with me only 20 seconds we have to be very careful about this
3397177 they each called it frustrating sometimes and then i said to them do you have feedback do you see the game afterwards and they said yes we do then i said how many times were you wrong and the assistant was wrong and believe me the coaches were more often wrong than the assistants
3397178 i interviewed all of the coaches and they were very honest some of them never saw a law book for the last five or six years van der ende said
3397179 in my opinion we can be more open but all the referees must be ready for that van der ende said
3397180 but i held my line from what i felt inside the car
3397181 ive seen tony kanaan and helio castroneves do that all the time
3397182 i keep working at it as i want it to be perfect

3397184 its a pleasure to celebrate the halfway point in the 5 23 extension project with the airport and community leaders
3397185 it has been a pleasure to watch this place grow and thrive for the more than 30 years and i know that because of projects like this our airport will be serving this community well for decades to come
3397186 a growing thriving airport is crucial to the economic vitality of our region

3397188 our deck of cards is inspired by the most wanted iraqi playing cards
3397189 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3397190 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3397191 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3397192 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3397193 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3397194 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3397195 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3397196 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3397197 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3397198 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3397199 the global proliferation of laptops smartphones and other mobile devices has propelled the need for data protection and theft recovery services for all types of users

3397205 hats off to roman and gabor they rode a high risk race in spite of the bad weather they could afford to though because they didnt have much to lose i had to be more careful because i wanted to gain third place in the overall positioning in wet conditions the rules are different and its a whole other ball game this time titleholders martin bauer honda and werner daemen yoshimura van zon schafer motorsport suzuki came off badly
3397206 once again the results depended on whether the tyre gamble paid off or not the state of the championships counted a lot for us as well andy meklau is now the best suzuki rider and has moved up from fourth place to third place in the table his other suzuki colleagues werner daemen and roman stamm have taken up positions behind him we might not be able to win the title but we will show everyone just how strong we are in the final

3397218 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3397219 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3397220 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3397221 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3397222 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3397223 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3397224 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3397225 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3397226 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3397227 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3397228 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3397229 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3397230 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3397231 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3397232 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3397233 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3397234 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3397235 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3397236 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3397237 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3397238 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3397239 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3397240 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3397241 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3397242 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3397243 assuming that the success of a marriage affects ones ability to lead a country is in my eyes as bad as combining church and state

3397245 we are pleased to begin this new service to the heartland of illinois

3397268 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3397269 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3397270 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3397271 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3397272 for us to accomplish that mission we needed to shed a lot of extra baggage
3397273 we needed to focus a little more we needed to make quicker decisions we needed to be ok saying no to certain stuff and we needed to weed through stuff quicker
3397274 one of the coolest things was rick actually suggested that we all stand up and rock out like we would live
3397275 and we did and it put a lot of life into the basic tracking of it all it was almost to the point where when i was retracking stuff i was standing up headbanging id never done that in a recording situation before hes a great song doctor and he has great ears
3397276 the great thing about working with rick is hes never around
3397277 i would say thats a very strong point in that it leaves the four of us to take on the entire brunt of the work and the planning that goes into the songwriting process and the recording process
3397278 bob would add a lot of his own musical input and with that came a lot of his own influences and style and jurisdiction and idiosyncrasies
3397279 and it would eventually make it into our sound but with rick because he wasnt there its almost 100 percent undiluted metallica hed come in and say thats good that isnt change that and we would have to figure that out for ourselves this is the most pure weve sounded in a long time
3397280 rick is not the kind of producer like a bob rock whos there every moment holding your hand making you step up
3397281 rock arranged everything all the time and wore many hats in the studio rick rubin no hat rick comes in and goes well wheres the songs ok thats good thats not so good more of this less of that see you in a few months goodbye and thats what we needed that brutal honesty to get through it and it worked
3397282 the slipknot that he did the system of a down records he did and even the johnny cash stuff where its the essence of him and you hear him you hear whats going on thats what i want i want people to really hear metallica
3397283 so in a way its got somewhat of an older sound songs and arrangement wise weve got a lot more diversity on the record instrumentals fast shorter songs epic ballady moments its quite different from st anger where if youre angry this is your album and if youre not it might take some work
3397284 last year we had a bad time at brno i could only finish seventh and it was quite disheartening this year however were going there in a very different frame of mind leading the championship following a great win and with our bike and tyres working very well ive had a good summer break just relaxing with my friends and family but now i am really looking forward to going racing again i know that brno is going to be hard and that casey will be a formidable competitor once again and were going to have to work at the maximum from the first practice in order not to lose any time in finding out the right set up for our bike we have seven races left and i am dreaming of them all being as fun as laguna seca
3397285 i am going to brno with a high hopes and above all trying not to think about the disappointment of laguna seca its behind me now in the usa i was fast once again and i hope that i can carry on like this in the czech republic i know that i can brno is a circuit that i like a lot its one of my favourites ive won there three times in 125cc and 250cc its a good place for my riding style and the weather is normally perfect physically i feel very good after the crash and the injuries i definitely feel as good as could be expected its the first time this season that ive really had proper time to recover thanks to the holidays so i think i am in good shape at the moment i am still using my crutches to walk but i have been able to do some training and i know that i wont have a problem when i arrive in brno on thursday
3397286 brno will be the start of a very important run of seven rounds to the end of the season with 25 points on stoner and 41 on pedrosa we are in a good position but we have to manage this advantage in the remaining races it will be an exciting end to the season with pedrosa back in the fight and lorenzo i am sure able to re join the podium club last year at most of these final circuits we werent able to fight at the top but we are working hard now to be able to provide valentino with the most competitive package to allow him to race at the front as he has for the majority of this years races every race from now on will be very important and brno could be one of the most difficult for us against our competitors we have to use all of our potential and work at 100 in all of the practices everybody in yamaha is extremely motivated and we cant wait to be back in the battle especially after the exciting laguna seca show
3397287 from talking to jorge it seems that he is feeling much better he is back in training and we are expecting him to be as fit as he could be in the circumstances the crash was a huge disappointment but at least he has had the maximum time to get over it and we know that he will have made the most of the break in brno the first aim for jorge is to get back the feeling and confidence that he had at the start of the season so that he can enjoy the remaining races we need to rebuild his confidence in the bike in practice at laguna he was looking good he was fast and qualified fourth then on the day we had some rear grip issues and the crash was very unfortunate rear grip is now the biggest thing we have to work on improving on the bike we need to work together with michelin to improve this the new surface also adds an unknown quantity to this race and so tyre choice is going to be especially important the team is very motivated and looking forward to getting back to work were hoping for a good race jorge certainly deserves one

3397290 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3397291 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3397292 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3397293 professor theophilus i know these arent your office hours but what is that foul smelling stuff
3397294 not fixed like that i guess you were in a hurry this morning huh
3397295 you were saying these arent my office hours they arent
3397296 its not so bad now that i know what it is i thought well never mind
3397297 i went home for easter its important to my family you know i havent believed that stuff for years but i think this was the first time they figured that out i let something slip right during easter dinner unfortunately
3397298 well maybe theres a god youve got me thinking about that and i suppose jesus existed but all those errors in the bible i mean cmon you know and they i mean my family they gave me a sort of hard time you following me im not telling this very well
3397299 i think im following you you said it wasnt true they said it was then what
3397300 so i told them id stopped believing in christianity when i went off to college the big thing was the bible i found out about all the crazy stuff in it during my freshman year i filled up a whole notebook with its errors and inconsistencies i still have it its in my backpack
3397301 i hadnt realized that youd ever been christian nathan so what answer did they give you
3397302 my mom started crying my dad said whassamatter with you upsetting your mother on easter my older brother called me a dumb egghead and punched me in the arm my sister in law got all cheery and said anyone for dessert who wants black bottom pie who wants coconut cake everyone started yelling out their choices
3397303 pretty much later on one of my uncles took me aside and said theres a time and a place for everything son as though id had a choice about that
3397304 anyway still later i had another thought i still cant see how any reasonable and intelligent person can believe in that infallible word of god baloney but youre a reasonable and intelligent person and like i said you did get me thinking about god so i thought id come and see you
3397305 will you read my notebook about the errors and inconsistencies in the bible
3397306 awww will you at least let me tell you whats in it
3397307 here are two mistakes i found about animals they devastated me a bat is not a bird
3397308 not a bird god is telling the israelites the things they arent allowed to eat or moses is or god speaking for moses he lists the eagle the vulture the osprey and so on then a few verses later and the bat 1 see the bible thinks bats are birds professor theophilus a bat is not a bird its a mammal
3397309 it is he who sits above the circle of the earth and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers who stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them like a tent to dwell in who brings princes to nought and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing 3 the circle of the earth get it the bible says the earth is a disk but we all know its really a ball
3397310 you can say that again the book of genesis says they do the l
3397311 because you have done this cursed are you above all cattle and above all wild animals upon your belly you shall go and dust you shall eat all the days of your life
3397312 nathan theyre just plain silly in the first place youre forgetting how translation works words in different languages arent exact equivalents take the business about birds and bats the ancient hebrew word translated birds doesnt correspond exactly to our word birds apparently it means something like things that have wings well bats have wings dont they
3397313 or take the business about hares eating their cud the ancient hebrew word translated cud doesnt correspond exactly to our word cud apparently it refers to any sort of partially digested matter rabbits dont regurgitate partially digested matter and chew it again like cows do but did you know that they pass pellets of partially digested matter and eat them again
3397314 well now you do but theres a bigger issue not only are you forgetting how translation works youre forgetting how inspiration works god didnt dictate the scriptures
3397315 no thats how islam believes muhammad got the quran an angel is supposed to have come to muhammad and said write but thats never been how christians thought gods people got the bible insight from the holy spirit passed through the minds of human writers the important question is whether that insight got through intact and we believe it did
3397316 but if the bible is wrong about rabbits and bats
3397317 i dont think it is wrong about rabbits and bats nathan but to tell you the truth i wouldnt much care if it was
3397318 no thats not what faith depends on did you think god gave us the bible because we needed a zoology textbook he gave it to us because we were wrecked and we needed to be healed the message of the scriptures is the nature of man the nature of god the meaning of life and the history and plan of salvation thats what theyre teaching us and all of that teaching is infallibly true
3397319 how about the isaiah passage i quoted it doesnt look like the bible is saying anything there about the nature of man the nature of god or any of that other jazz its all cosmology bad cosmology because the earth is not a disk not to mention that the heavens are not a tent you can tell that these people were nomads
3397320 weve talked about how translation works and how inspiration works now youre forgetting a third thing
3397321 how poetry works in the same passage isaiah says that to god the inhabitants of the earth are like grasshoppers do you think he was giving us an entomology lesson was he saying that humans belong to the class of orthoptera which includes grasshoppers locusts and crickets
3397322 no wed just look that way from up high its a simile
3397323 but doesnt the earth look like a circle from up high and dont the heavens look like a curtain from any position its poetic language like the seven seas havent you ever used that expression
3397324 when youve used it were you thinking that there are seven separate seas that you can count
3397325 so are the circle of the earth and the curtain of the heavens
3397326 if all of that language is poetry whats the point
3397327 all right all right but you cant say that the genesis passage is poetry
3397328 figurative language doesnt have to be pretty nathan here lets try something
3397329 go to kreugel and key in make them eat dust dont forget the quotation marks
3397330 see theres proof we even talk that way in english so why shouldnt they have talked that way in ancient hebrew if you want to debunk the bible youre going to have to do better than this
3397331 i guess that example wasnt as good as i thought
3397332 no it wasnt in fact all four of your examples were pretty shallow if were dealing with things that are important to you thats progress but we havent even begun to consider what i view as the main issues what the scriptures are how they should be read how god approaches us through them cant you pitch me some really hard examples
3397333 lemmee think what were you saying again about the message of the scriptures what did you say that they were teaching us so accurately
3397334 i think i said something like the nature of man the nature of god the meaning of life and the history and plan of salvation
3397335 ok prof then ive got you after all the bible contradicts itself about all of those things
3397336 why are some fighting so hard for retroactive immunity the answer i believe is that immunity means secrecy and secrecy means power
3397337 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
3397338 cops dont like the foil the freedom of information law
3397339 in light of the kafkaesque review process it is not surprising that the delay in this case stretched many months beyond the statutorily prescribed time frame
3397340 we need to disclose and have this information released and let the people decide what they think about it my attitude is always give out as much information as possible its always better
3397341 far too often when citizens seek records from our government they are met with long delays denials and difficulties for too long federal agencies have routinely and repeatedly denied citizens requests for information with near impunity
3397342 weve got a proprietary attitude about government like those who are elected or those who work in it own it weve got to be reminded that it really belongs to all of us
3397343 disclosing information may cause damage but you know what withholding that information may even cause greater damage and i dont think we have sufficiently taken that into account
3397344 when records are wiped out of existence it is impossible to ever fully understand the governments decision making
3397345 there is a foundational principle that is you cannot have accountability in anything unless you have transparenc what we have is obfuscation of transparency
3397346 it is disgraceful that the congress and the american people must rely on leaks lawsuits and freedom of information act requests to find out what our own government is doing
3397347 democracies die in darkness the thing that i think will do us in is secret government
3397348 in a democracy open government is defined not by the obvious but the obscure
3397349 openness in government is essential to the functioning of a democracy
3397350 a strongly worded mandate for full public access to information concerning the workings of government
3397351 we serve the people the people dont serve us and sometimes i think we forget that when we dont want to tell people how we come to decisions
3397352 the classification system has proved to be stubbornly resistant to reform or correction
3397353 im a huge proponent of public records but public records laws were not written with the internet in mind
3397354 public records laws are like statistics you can find a way to get around them it comes down to a philosophy either you are for open government or youre not
3397355 our founders did not enshrine freedom of the press and the first amendment because they got good press they understood that the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press
3397356 the people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them the people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know
3397357 there have been too many stories about how federal scientists find their voices muzzled or their statements altered to insure that inconvenient truths dont slip out
3397358 examining public records should never require extraordinary legal or bureaucratic efforts when it does its usually a red flag
3397359 the public interest in being updated on the condition of these dams outweighs the security concerns about giving out the information
3397360 force our law enforcement agencies to publicly release information that may compromise public safety
3397361 demonstrates a shocking indifference to the publics right to know
3397362 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names although such stories might make some jurors less willing to serve or more distracted from the case this is a necessary cost of the openness of the judicial process
3397363 warped tour was great but we cant wait to get back into venues that actually have roofs over our heads and arent 110 degrees

3397459 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3397460 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3397461 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3397462 the line was so long i was like what is this
3397463 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3397464 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3397465 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3397466 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3397467 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3397468 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3397469 explain how to carve out time and to utilize your creative mind
3397470 we had that support from everyone we went out there and showed what we could do today my day didnt go as well as id hoped but i was focused i stayed on and i fought as hard as i could i believe i left it all out there heart and soul
3397471 the whole way through we focused on one event at a time one routine at a time
3397472 its just unbelievable considering everything weve been through its been a roller coaster ride i couldnt be prouder of these guys of all the coaches and this whole collective collaborative effort

3397547 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3397548 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3397549 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3397550 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3397551 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3397552 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3397553 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3397554 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3397555 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat

3397571 youll never use all your own ideas and even if you are very creative you will never create all the ideas that you need
3397572 any serious or semi serious attempt to improve innovate or invent from a back of the napkin session in a restaurant to a multibillion dollar research and development lab will produce too many good ideas to use and not enough good ideas to meet all your objectives
3397573 traditional corporate researchers tend to invent and discover for themselves and hope vaguely if they think of it at all that their ideas will be developed and commercialised meanwhile traditional corporate development likes to have ideas ready for prime time and to favour incremental improvement of existing ideas over radical anything in particular

3397629 there are no more mysteries about the toronto situation as it pertains to next season
3397630 during the stanley cup playoffs i heard and read agent j
3397631 it has to be as obvious to mats as it is to all of us that the leafs are going down a different path with very few of the core players in recent years guys that he went to war with so mats knows pretty much everything he has to about the toronto situation as j p was requesting a few months ago the fact he hasnt yet re signed with the leafs indicates to me that he has no real enthusiasm to go back and i believe he still wants to play plus i think he knows the leafs cannot change much if he does return but thats just my opinion i have no indication either way whats on his mind
3397632 i know what cliff is trying to do because it falls in line with his entire plan re shaping the meat of the roster
3397633 but im not sure fletcher is making the right decision by letting bryan go i still think hes a very talented player maybe the best on the current leafs team and like you i think he makes tomas kaberle a better defenseman but its obvious that cliff feels he has to move forward without mccabe
3397634 but im not sure fletcher is making the right decision by letting bryan go i still think hes a very talented player maybe the best on the current leafs team and like you i think he makes tomas kaberle a better defenseman
3397635 im not going to start talking to teams until he tells me what teams he is willing to go to
3397636 we will certainly not sit idly by if the maple leafs take a position which is unreasonable and unfair to bryan mccabe
3397637 in our view telling him not to show up and stay home we would view that as utterly unreasonable we would undoubtedly file a grievance and pursue that one aggressively on behalf of bryan
3397638 i think in the end if it works out it would hopefully be good for bryan and the leafs
3397639 with him dictating where he wants to go probably not much
3397640 we will probably have to take back a matching contract and some players in the deal
3397641 with him dictating where he wants to go probably not much
3397642 we will probably have to take back a matching contract and some players in the deal
3397643 and philly gets themselves under the cap with this deal
3397644 across the country democrats independents and republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington

3397647 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3397648 it is a reaction to bajaur and other operations and if these are not stopped then we will launch more attacks
3397649 you cannot imagine what atrocities the government is committing against innocent women and children
3397650 us growth is doing much better than domestic spending would indicate both because exports are booming and because some of the weakness in domestic demand is being passed on to the rest of the world through lower imports
3397651 while rapid export growth has been a crucial support to the us economy that now appears under threat as the evidence from europe and japan shows a rising threat of recession
3397652 we are not buying a whole lot of goods from anywhere but with a lessening of inflation pressures from the drop in oil prices and the firming of the dollar the fed will likely stay on hold for quite a while
3397653 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3397654 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3397655 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3397656 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia
3397657 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia
3397658 now we have to see whether the russians are not only stopping military operations but redeploying and withdrawing the troops that have been brought into georgia on august 6 and accept international monitoring of the ceasefire agreement
3397659 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3397660 we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis

3397664 we held two trial matches where akhtar proved his fitness and he is willing to return and since he is determined he is an asset for pakistan
3397665 i am gearing up for the champions trophy after putting the terrible last few months behind me
3397666 his lawyer has argued that akhtar can pay the fine once the appeal against the reduced ban is heard in the court so we have decided to keep the legal matter and cricket separate
3397667 we rested akmal and he too showed improvement in the trial matches so we have included him
3397668 since we would miss yousuf we have included a specialist batsman bazid khan and have also brought in opener khalid latif
3397669 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3397670 and you can bet theyre windsor residents wondering who is really telling the truth windsor mayor eddie francis or detroits kwame kilpatrick as a disbelieving judge said to the mayor the other day thats a no brainer
3397671 on tuesday francis had to travel to toronto for a municipal association meeting
3397672 that doesnt quite jibe with quotes attributed to francis and sutts in saturdays star
3397673 the red bull air race may yet return to the area next year mayor eddie francis said monday
3397674 francis travelled to london england last month to meet with red bull representatives in the hopes of attracting the high speed low flying acrobatic competition back to the detroit river
3397675 francis said discussions are already underway to bring the red bull air race back to the area though that decision like the rest of the show is still up in the air
3397676 a number of issues which francis wouldnt elaborate on had race directors leaning away from a return the windsor detroit area
3397677 were going to be meeting with the detroit riverfront conservancy in the next two weeks to see how we can work with detroit
3397678 corporate sponsorship and logistics have yet to be worked out before red bull will consider a return in 2009

3397687 venues should take urgent action to reduce costs particularly the vast expenditure on hype and promotion
3397688 blatant disgraceful and cheap effort by tommy to sell more tickets for his shows especially at a time when venues should be coming together to help each other in the year that the fringe has had so many problems
3397689 this is not behaviour befitting someone standing for the fringe society board
3397690 i rather think its a cheap and disingenuous attack on us

3397706 o lord forgive me and my brother and admit us to your grace for you are the most compassionate of all
3397707 o lord if you had so pleased you could have annihilated them and me before this will you destroy us for something the foolish among us have done this is but a trial from you whereby you will lead whom you will astray and guide whom you please you are our saviour so forgive us and have mercy on us for you are the best of forgivers 156 enjoin for us good in the world and good in the world to come we turn to you alone

3397711 this has never happened before in my time at eastbourne theatres
3397712 we are extremely frustrated that the show is now not going to happen at all and that our theatregoers have been so inconvenienced
3397713 we have over the past years produced 27 weeks at the devonshire park which shows not only our commitment to the venue and to eastbourne but to theatre in the provinces in general
3397714 although the set was the main issue there were a number of other issues which eastbourne theatres have conveniently forgotten to mention
3397715 we are sorry for any inconvenience caused to patrons and i am sure they will realise that this course of action would never have been taken unless absolutely unavoidable
3397716 we are grateful for the support of the trust and its predecessors for the past 16 years but we believe that we have contributed much to their own aims and objectives to challenge the stigma associated with mental health
3397717 we calculate we have brought almost 60 000 people into what was previously seen as a daunting victorian psychiatric institution not to mention the young people more than 3 000 of them who have taken part in the shows and training
3397718 the theatres trust is very concerned that the jubilee theatres future is under threat and we will resist any change of use over the last 16 years first act theatre has put a lot of energy into making this grade ii theatre accessible to thousands of young people
3397719 we have not given users of the theatre verbal or written notice to quit in fact we have reassured them that they can continue to take bookings for productions planned for this year including the annual pantomime we have kept the users of the jubilee theatre informed about the review and will continue to do so

3397751 up until this morning we had only had three minor injuries not ones that players didnt come in with to camp its the fewest that ive been a part of so far and i think we are practicing in a way that will help us keep them down which is possible
3397752 it is a delicate balance as a head coach to get enough physical work but also to keep your team healthy
3397753 we are erring on the side of the health just knowing how long the season is and how it could possibly work against us early in the season but we will have to see
3397754 but harvey is so good with the ball in his hands that i dont see us going that way jay drew covers byu athletics for the tribune

3397758 he felt a but quiet at the last line turning away from the exit he had not had a show jumping fence down since 2005 so it was a pity he had to do it here
3397759 now i will have to keep going until london for a gold but we are so lucky to be here taking part in a marvellous sport
3397760 alex is very talented very bright but he is inexperienced at this level he did well to qualify we didnt expect him to advance against this level of opposition what he needs is to compete internationally more often and spend more time training with elite fencers in hungary that is all in the pipeline
3397761 im sorry not to have done a better round to pull the rest of the team up
3397762 cavvy call again cavalier has not hit a fence for two years and to go into the final round and hit two is disappointing he just didnt get enough
3397763 now we go into the individual rounds and if can do a clear round that would be good
3397764 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3397765 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i dont want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened
3397766 it certainly means i have a lot of unfinished business with the olympics but i also think the olympics are something more special anyway
3397767 there were times in the last 12 weeks when i thought how can this be happening has someone put a jinx on me
3397768 but then id go to bed and think no this is the olympics im not going to give up
3397769 regardless of what happened four years ago this still would have been something i fought for i have not taken stupid risks with my leg but at every point i have tested it and pushed it a bit further because youre taking a gamble

3397773 the patients in this study were all patients who had been in the emergency department for at least 12 hours waiting for changes in cardiac enzymes and waiting for a stress test
3397774 so by doing mri early on we were able to detect myocardial injury before the rise of cardiac enzymes there were some patients who had increased cardiac enzymes at a later stage but we were able to detect both edema and necrosis before the increase in cardiac enzymes
3397775 the beauty of this is the combination of delayed enhancement looking at myocardial necrosis and t2 weighted imaging looking at myocardial edema
3397776 by combining this information we can differentiate patients with acute vs old mi and which patients had unstable angina vs non stemi unstable angina is very difficult for different modalities to detect and we were able to detect it in the great majority of cases
3397777 at this point just using initial clinical risk assessment based on ecg and cardiac enzymes we are not doing a great job and thats why many physicians are just admitting patients for catheterization or in some cases 2 to 4 of patients are discharged when they actually have acs
3397778 so we think this is really impressive mri remained a significant predictor above and beyond traditional cardiac risk factors and clinical risk assessment specifically if you have a positive mri you have 120 times higher likelihood of having acs as compared with patients with normal mr after adjusting for traditional cardiac risk factors and clinical risk assessment
3397779 ct will i think be the first line test in the acute chest pain setting for patients with low likelihood of having acs whereas mri i believe will be used more in patients with intermediate likelihood of acs
3397780 in the future i can see the emergency physicians stratifying the patient as low intermediate or high risk based on risk factors and type of chest pain etc and patients with low risk would probably go to ct whereas in patients with intermediate risk or even high risk but no diagnostic ecg and negative enzymes mri would be a better test

3398031 if you lose weight after diagnosis you can achieve some long term benefits in terms of blood pressure and glycemic control that extend even beyond the point at which you regain weight
3398032 we havent had results like this before this is telling us that with a significant mean weight loss of 10 7 kilograms 23 5 pounds in 18 months theres an improvement despite weight regain after 36 months
3398033 we will try to keep as much of the original show as possible
3398034 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3398035 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3398036 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3398037 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3398038 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3398039 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3398040 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3398041 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3398042 i would say that without getting the business background it would have been fairly impossible to take an invention anywhere
3398043 so what we had to do is start teaching entrepreneurship to engineers
3398044 not so long ago if an engineer had a small invention he would just hope that there would be someone on business side that would recognize brilliance and see the application
3398045 most of the time it would have died right there
3398046 to help develop and motivate the next generation of energy entrepreneurs
3398047 what we try to do in terms of the course is to give them the sense that there is a structure in place for how to present your ideas

3398058 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3398059 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3398060 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3398061 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3398062 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia

3398114 overall the z100fd is a solid camera that performed well if unremarkably for a compact point and shoot and even if its performance isnt always stunning the z100fd never lets fashion get in the way of function
3398115 the fully automatic auto and multiple scene modes make it a snap for anyone to use and manual mode gives more control to the experienced user combine that with the good quality images and you have a very attractive little package
3398116 the sd890 is is responsive enough but its not going to set any records boot up time is fine at 2 7 seconds recycle time is decent at 2 98 seconds though the sd890s shutter lag at 1 4 seconds i wouldnt hesitate to recommend the sd890 is for its ease of use versatility and impressive images
3398117 overall the sd890 is a highly powerful versatile camera for any casual user who wants to take quality photographs the camera is excellent quality and moderately priced you cannot go wrong with the purchase of a powerful and stylish canon powershot sd890 is
3398118 the outdoor quality from the sd890 was very good the camera did an excellent job with the exposures and white balancing allowing very vivid colors our indoor portraits were also very good the camera produced pleasing results with nice exposure and accurate white balance with and without the flash
3398119 the canon sd890 is delivers better high iso capabilities than most of the competition high iso quality combined with the highly effective image stabilization system will help ensure that low light and indoor photographers will get their shots and be able to make good prints too
3398120 pros af performance remains a highlight clean vibrant shots even at higher isos almost too easy to use new styling and interface if you like it

3398126 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3398127 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3398128 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3398129 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3398130 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3398131 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3398132 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3398133 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3398134 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3398135 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3398136 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3398137 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3398138 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3398139 the prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and this epidemic is accompanied by a high incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease
3398140 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3398141 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3398142 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3398143 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3398144 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3398145 for years the ms society has had a library available to support the information needs of people affected by ms but there has been no way for people to search it themselves and access the documents

3398150 are there any games that dont attract this type of idiot
3398151 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3398152 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status

3398156 we all possess some intuitive sense we know our convictions from our mere hunches
3398157 this sense of confidence or lack thereof is critical to our success but how it arises in the brain has long been a mystery
3398158 these neurons seem to have been registering after the rat made its decision how uncertain the animal was that it was about to receive its desired reward
3398159 we tested several alternative explanations but the best explanation for the neural activity we observed was that these neurons were signaling the confidence of the animal about its decisions
3398160 although previous work had suggested that confidence estimates might be a complex process restricted to humans and perhaps other primates
3398161 our results to the contrary show that for the brain to estimate confidence in a choice is no more complex than calculating the choice itself
3398162 this new option to abort and restart constitutes a decision that should be made based on the level of confidence about getting a reward
3398163 ultimately confidence about getting a reward is a direct function of the animals confidence about the decision they have just made in this way we sought to measure a variable internal to the animals how confident they were about whether they made the right choice or not by observing how it influenced their behavior
3398164 that confidence estimation is not a complex function specific to humans but a core component of the process of decision making probably found throughout the animal kingdom
3398165 future studies of this kind may illuminate the question of how we form an intuitive sense of the solidity of a belief how we distinguish fact from fiction itself

3398175 even after giving credit for the reduction in workmans comp expenses growers have had a net increase of 46 per acre in the past two years
3398176 thats 12 million plus not counting the cost of living and farming increases that all of society is attempting to absorb
3398177 government agencies operating independently are adversely affecting the ability of the family farmer in our industry to produce a nutritious piece of california citrus
3398178 let alone stay in business our regulatory costs according to the institute have reached 400 per acre with 270 000 acres now in production state government sucks an estimated 108 million from our industry to feed the bureaucracy
3398179 the new disaster assistance program is better because it is more comprehensive than past programs which took an ad hoc approach
3398180 this approach is not only more equitable and reliable but it helps to eliminate duplicate payments for the same losses
3398181 its important for growers to be aware of these deadlines so they can make informed decisions about an important part of farm finances
3398182 given how many applications must be reviewed we urge farmers to learn what they are eligible for and apply as soon as possible

3398186 we are very excited with the results of this study and are planning to meet with the u s food and drug administration fda in the fourth quarter of this year to discuss the results of this study and determine the next steps in the submission of a new drug application nda for ipx056
3398187 such spasticity treatments represent a 1 6 billion market in the u s and ipx056 may fill an unmet medical need in these patients
3398188 we are very pleased with the progress we have made in advancing our proprietary brand products and expect to continue this progress with an expansion in our r amp d staff this year the cns space is ideally suited to our core competency in drug delivery as so many products are candidates for improved dosing and administration and the market is large and growing at almost 10 annually faster than the total u s pharmaceutical market in addition the neurology market is readily addressable by a small and focused sales force given the concentration of physicians writing prescriptions we currently have 66 specialty sales representatives to market our products and to serve as a contract force for others

3398202 these depictions often appeal to persons with a very specific sexual fetish who find them sexually arousing or otherwise exciting

3398221 they dont know when or if to begin treatment if neurologists knew which patients were at high risk for rapid progression to ms they could treat them with disease modifying therapy that appears to be beneficial in early ms

3398650 financial results for bankers life although improved over the first quarter were disappointing as it continued to be pressured by higher than expected initial claims in its long term care business
3398651 measures implemented last quarter to address this issue including premium re rates and enhanced claims management policies and procedures will lead to improved performance
3398652 importantly our long term care closed block of business returned to profitability in the quarter as our efforts to strengthen reserves and improve claims management over the past year are proving successful

3398659 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3398660 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3398661 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3398669 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3398670 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3398681 entrepreneurs can practice a new kind of dreaming intentional dreaming which has nothing to do with problem solving and everything to do with transforming your whole life and business in a radically creative and strategic way the surprising reason that most small businesses fail is not because their dream is too big but rather too small too realistic it isnt big enough to sustain more life
3398682 many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than in the one where they sprang up
3398683 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3398684 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3398685 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3398686 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering it forced me to miss the open and it comes in a ryder cup year
3398687 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr andrew weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
3398688 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3398689 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3398690 none of my friends would have imagined me as an activist
3398691 they told me that even though i was an american citizen the chinese government doesnt recognize dual citizenship so i have no rights as an american by traveling on my taiwanese documents in china the chinese authorities have the right to detain me and to subject me to the full extent of chinese law
3398692 it was scary because they warned me if i was low profile now i will be high profile and i will be followed once i enter tibetan regions
3398693 but i felt that i couldnt let my fear stop me
3398694 the further west i traveled the more intense it got until i was very very scared
3398695 the local tibetans told me that these police stations had sprung up after the protests in march if theres a way to instill fear in people this is the way to do it youre not going to go out in the street and protest when you see fifty armed police to the left and right of you
3398696 my heart doesnt feel right if his photo isnt up somewhere
3398697 if you put up a photo in a temple that act cant necessarily be traced back to you but wearing a pendant is a very personal thing the tibetans take so many risks for this small freedom
3398698 it was really difficult for me to hear what they had to say the spectrum is just so far apart from what the tibetans believe and what the chinese believe the chinese say we developed this region we built these roads look at that hospital when you confront them with the bad things they focus on the good things they would say we referring to me as well i wanted to scream no no im not chinese they get to send their kids to school for free because theyre in a minority region and they make more money there but it really seems theyre taking over the economy and pushing tibetans further aside id heard about this id read about it id even talked about it but it wasnt until i was there that i could feel what occupation was actually like
3398699 theres a good reason that foreigners arent allowed in these places it looks like a war zone in kardze the police are in the middle of the sidewalks theyre sitting in helmets holding their guns and riot shields in rows of 10 or 15 they are outside convenience stores under blue tarps every half a block on both sides of the road watching theyre up on raised metal posts with cutout windows watching i couldnt walk anywhere without dozens of armed police staring at me ive never seen so many police and military personnel in one town in my life nor have i experienced this kind of heart pounding fear before
3398700 i cant imagine anyone protesting here any more because as soon as they do anything suspicious theyll be swept away we talk about freedom of speech but when youre under such heavy surveillance you cant even think about saying anything that these armed police dont want you to say
3398701 no theyre here to protect us why should we be scared
3398702 if the tibetans went wild and pulled out their swords again then these police would keep them in line
3398703 as soon as i arrived i went to check my email at an internet cafe i opened something from google notifications and found a message in broken english
3398704 were trying to promote awareness and dialogue about whats going on in tibet by raising tibetan flags worldwide id been in contact with people in dharamsala about the campaign its just become a part of the dialogue after i received this email from google i seriously considered going back for the first time i seriously feared for my safety it was such a foreign feeling because i grew up in minnesota where i could say whatever i want read whatever i want and write whatever i want without thinking anything of it and all of a sudden this freedom was taken away and i was always looking over my shoulder if its something you grew up with you dont think oh im so lucky because i can write whatever i want today or im so lucky because i can log onto whatever website i want today this isnt just about tibet this is about a sixth of the world that dont even know what theyre missing because state propaganda is just that good
3398705 they pounded and yelled at every single door until they got to mine they looked around the room and warned me if you do anything suspicious therell be consequences after they left i was shaking
3398706 i was chain smoking by this point the combination of the email the hotel raid and the tense atmosphere was emotionally draining i honestly dont know how people live in that kind of fear
3398707 its quite a steep climb and i went all the way to the rooftop from there you get a panoramic view of kardze these regions are really beautiful you can see the valley the distant grasslands and the snow capped mountains in the background that surround the town so i took pictures but i couldnt help myself i took a few zoomed in shots of the military base i didnt know that i was playing with fire
3398708 i thought this is it i cant believe i took those pictures
3398709 it was very intimidating i kept asking them whats wrong whats going on all they would say was wait and see i kept thinking wait and see for what
3398710 the first thing they did was look through the photos on my camera of course they found the shots of the military camp they started whispering to each other i said im sorry i take pictures of everything look at the photos of the mountains and the valleys and the houses but i knew i was in a lot of trouble
3398711 they flipped through my journal and filmed everything every sheet of paper that i had front and back i told them im going back to chengdu tomorrow morning look heres my bus ticket but they said were going to return your bus ticket and take you to kangding for further investigation apparently it wasnt in their jurisdiction to process my case where we were i kept telling them i need to call the us embassy but they very simply clarified you are a chinese citizen traveling in china on your chinese documents youll be prosecuted according to chinese law i didnt have any rights as an american at that point
3398712 china throws human rights activists into prison i remembered a documentary id seen in which one of chinas top lawyers said that he lost 99 of his cases dealing with human rights activists it takes months even years for people to even get a trial in china
3398713 id heard first hand testimonies for years from tibetan former political prisoners nuns getting electric cattle prods inserted into their vaginas people told to stand barefoot on blocks of ice and then pushed off an hour later so that the skin of their heels would peel off monks who have to use plastic cups because the electric shocks caused so much nerve damage to their fingers that they keep dropping glasses i never imagined that id be in a position where it was conceivable that id receive that kind of treatment
3398714 that hard drive contained photos of me speaking in front of tibetan flags me handing out tibetan flags me waving tibetan flags press releases that had my name under the header co founder of the raise tibetan flags campaign the whole raise tibetan flags campaign website that i put together from illustrator they could see everything ive been doing for the last few years
3398715 they saw my long face and that i wasnt eating
3398716 i was in the back seat in between two police officers a tibetan policewoman who kept regurgitating patriotic communist propaganda and the officer who had arrested me
3398717 all sorts of things kept drifting in and out of my head if they gave me 15 years id be 39 when i was released i wondered how many years it would take before id want to kill myself how would i do it id read about people killing themselves underneath their blankets and i wondered how they managed it it was the first time in my life that i actually thought about committing suicide
3398718 i meet these people in dharamsala all the time the hippies who smoke indian cigarettes and dont wear shoes because they love nature i decided that i was going to be tree hugging buddhist seeker wen i couldnt tell them the truth if i did i would be exposing a lot of people and i would be sending myself to prison
3398719 he was older than the others in his forties gray hair also not in uniform he was really nice to me but i got the feeling that he wasnt nice to everyone during the interrogation i became hippie wen when he asked me if id ever been to dharamsala i said oh yes i went to take the vipassana meditation course where for ten days i didnt speak to anyone at all and we werent even allowed to look anyone in the eyes this was all from stuff id heard from other people in all the years ive been coming to dharamsala ive never found the time to take a meditation course
3398720 i went into great detail about meditating in the indian himalayas how it really spoke to me and how spiritually developed i became
3398721 what do you think you would discover if you really looked into yourself and listened to your heart this made him laugh really loudly all communist officials are required to be atheist theyre not supposed to have any religion
3398722 ive never been good at lying or being put on the spot but i wasnt nervous at all if i needed more time to think about a question i would pick out specific chinese words and ask what does that mean again because they knew i grew up in the us and that my chinese isnt perfect or in my answer i would use an english word and say what is that in chinese when they asked me about the photographs i took i went into length about the magic of photography and composition and capturing the perfect subject i guess it was a pretty good performance because they seemed to believe me
3398723 i told them that i recently broke up with my boyfriend and it was just too hard to keep in contact with him so i decided to cancel my email account altogether
3398724 they told me well just take a quick look through your stuff again and then well send you back to your hotel in chengdu
3398725 i wanted them to feel guilty about putting me away i wanted to show them that im not a bad person and that i dont deserve to go to prison they gave me cigarettes and told me how much they envied me for being so young and having traveled all over the world they kept asking me questions about america what my parents were like things like that i asked them the same kinds of questions how old they were their kids names the female officer played me a britney spears song on her pink cell phone and had me guess which one it was i got it right it was oops i did it again we were all just hanging out laying on the bed or sitting in the recliner like we were on a road trip
3398726 four and a half hours later someone came in and said lets go
3398727 they actually looked worried as i was being swept away with these other officers
3398728 i instantly perked up why would he ask me where my hotel was if he wasnt going to take me to it on august 1st last year 2007 i was driving on a bridge and it fell down it was the 35w bridge in minneapolis my car fell 60 feet landed upside down and 13 people died that was at 6 pm when i went to the impound lot the guy hugged me because hed been sure i was dead by the looks of my car and here i was at 6 pm august 1st 2008 facing another miracle escape after chinese police had found everything they needed to convict me everything that they put people away for they hadnt asked me a single question about it i couldnt comprehend it
3398729 i was thinking please just give me back my passport but i went to dinner with them even though i didnt have an appetite
3398730 the policeman came gave me back my hard drive and said goodbye it was good to meet you and i walked away
3398731 people do stand up for what they believe in and they die for it i didnt do that i told them what they wanted to hear to get out of the situation but would i have gained more insight in prison i dont know i lied about my involvement and what i believe in to take the easy way out ill never be proud of that
3398732 human rights in tibet have to begin with human rights in china its very unlikely that human rights in tibet are going to improve on their own since im ethnically chinese i feel like this is what i need to work on im not a superstitious person but part of me feels that ive been given more than just a chance to do this work and that this is now the purpose of my life
3398733 the least experienced politician in at least one hundred years to obtain a major party nomination for president
3398734 too many of those criticizing obama have been content merely to slander him
3398735 silently and at times vocally cooperated with chicagos democratic machine
3398736 daley considered palmer a serious threat a potential mayoral rival
3398737 by clearing the ballot obama had done more than just elbow his way into power without a real election he had also erased any doubt of daleys path to his next term
3398738 he did not campaign for john stroger or even endorse him
3398739 hendon had been the original sponsor of two bills that obama often writes and speaks about as if they had been his own one required the taping of murder interrogations to help eliminate mistakes in the sic illinoiss death penalty system and the other was designed to reduce the incidence of racial profiling by the police
3398740 the murder interrogation bill requiring videotaping of interrogations in all capital cases was an excellent example of something with a broad bipartisan consensus in all but the minutest details coming as it did after thirteen death row inmates were found to have been falsely convicted in illinois
3398741 in hindsight it was best to go ahead with the weaker version because a lot of police attitudes changed when we passed it
3398742 would bark their displeasure at me and then theyd unload on obama
3398743 if barack obama is a reformer he may be the first reformer ever to become president of the united states before doing anything serious in the name of reform
3398744 was a real accomplishment for obama in the name of reform
3398745 theres never been a single time in senator obamas political career where he did something that was difficult and would cost him politically for the sake of needed reforms and change
3398746 he deserves full credit for opposing the war at a time when his position was not necessarily popular
3398747 obama has enjoyed success due to the failures of others
3398748 in the final weeks everything was pointing toward a hull victory
3398749 obama is currently running the first real political campaign of his life
3398750 the gospel stories of sick people hoping to touch even the hem of christs garments or hoping that saint peters shadow might pass over them and bring healing
3398751 hidden in obamas shapeless rhetoric about change and hope is a dangerous agenda that will take on real substance if he is given power
3398752 this bill would effectively cancel every state federal and local regulation of abortion no matter how modest or reasonable
3398753 obama is one of the very few pro choice advocates who accepts no restrictions on late term abortions or any kind of abortions
3398754 most antiabortion activists for example have openly discouraged legislative allies from even pursuing those compromise measures that would have significantly reduced the incidence of the procedure popularly known as partial birth abortion because the image the procedure evokes in the mind of the public has helped them win converts to their position
3398755 this questions not only the sincerity of pro lifers but also their dedication to their own cause
3398756 about 130 times over his eight year career there which other illinois senators say is unusually high
3398757 the average teacher in thornton township district was earning 83 000 that year
3398758 with teachers that expensive how could any such school district afford to keep teachers for a full school day
3398759 those on the left often find themselves defending an indefensible status quo insisting that more spending alone will improve educational outcomes
3398760 if i am the democratic nominee i will aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
3398761 my plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce return excess money from donors and stay within the public financing system for the general election
3398762 he was simply voting the party line the union line
3398763 he is a rigid doctrinaire liberal who votes and thinks along his party line
3398764 what do these relationships tell us about his judgment and the type of people with whom he will entrust executive powers if elected
3398765 this incident reveals far more about obamas political thinking than did the words of his conciliatory keynote convention speech
3398766 sought the endorsement of the marxist new party in chicago
3398767 it would be foolish to fear barack obama just because he had a communist father figure when he was young
3398768 if obama could understand and get along with radicals like palmer ayers and dohrn it is not because he agrees with everything they stand for it is probably because they share similar ideological influences
3398769 of greatest significance are the radical advisors with whom senator obama surrounds himself even now
3398770 it would be unreasonable to expect obama to accept as advisors only those who agree with every single belief he holds
3398771 would you join a church that proclaimed itself to be grounded in the writings of a racist
3398772 based upon the systematized liberation theology that started in 1969 with the publication of dr james cones seminal book black power and black theology
3398773 cones writings provide the context from within which the founding influences of obamas former church come
3398774 the rap against obama on foreign policy is not that sic so much that hes inconsistent but that he doesnt know what hes doing
3398775 make a substantial difference on the situation on the ground
3398776 obama seems wholly unaware of liberal democrats opposition to the policies that helped destroy the soviet union and even certain legislators collaboration with the soviets
3398777 he is especially disdainful of the so called star wars program which was crucial to bankrupting the soviets then
3398778 obama paid twice the tax assessed price for a ten foot wide strip of rezkos lot
3398779 but he has obama performed official acts while in office that benefited tony rezko
3398780 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3398783 these new silicon products will spur additional growth in bluetooth enabled product shipments and high speed bluetooth asps average selling prices will help to keep revenues strong as other bluetooth asps continue to decline
3398784 current market growth for bluetooth devices is primarily attributed to sales growth in mobile phones which is the top market for bluetooth silicon shipments
3398785 i was driving down folsom street in san francisco and i got a dropped call 10 times i get dropped calls just standing in one place
3398786 im extremely annoyed but im hopeful a software update will fix it
3398787 how a device performs in individual situations depends on circumstances like where you are in the 3g coverage how close you are to a cell site things like terrain and buildings all come into play
3398788 im not denying that people are having a less than satisfactory experience but overall the phone is doing great
3398789 adding that because the problems are likely to be embedded in the low level software and the chipset a firmware upgrade is unlikely to fix the problem

3398795 you need a photo id for this but not for voting
3398796 some westerners have argued that the west does not have a problem with islam but only with violent islamist extremists fourteen hundred years of history demonstrate otherwise
3398797 if we could win a battle of ideas against the communists we can stand with the vast majority of muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope
3398798 in the christian just war tradition there are criteria through which one must go barriers in effect to the deployment of armed force you have to justify force in islam you must search for ways to refrain from force
3398799 evolve from merely formal democratic commitments to more principled ones
3398800 we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3398801 our voters and edwardss voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3398802 my instinct tells me that she probably would have done better had senator edwards not been on the ballot in iowa but that wasnt the circumstances at the time
3398803 a woman may think she wants to end a pregnancy may even feel relief when she does but she will suffer for it later so the state has a duty to stop her

3398827 absolutely i think its necessary i mean we need to know whats going into our bodies

3398829 if an inmate refuses to join the program day hinted the parolee would be considered uncooperative

3398849 well one of the advantages of having experience in military and national security matters is you get the wisdom that comes with it i think hes is correctly calling this situation he said when he looked in the eyes of vladimir putin he saw a k a g and a b i think he senses correctly that russia still has an aggressive posture in terms of its foreign policy and this could be very well an example of that so senator mccains response an aggressive response as it relates to the u n as it relates to nato as it relates to sending the secretary of state to europe i think are the right steps and it reflects his wisdom and experience
3398850 surely we cannot simply stand by as an autocratic aggressor gobbles up part of and perhaps destabilizes all of a friendly democratic nation
3398851 we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation

3398885 historically the gap between hope and reality for mobile video television has been attributed to immature technology
3398886 video content on mobile phones looked broken or washed out soundtracks often did not align with the moving images
3398887 the mobile devices themselves were voracious consumers of battery life when displaying video content and carriers were not sure how commercial video and television services would affect their mobile networks
3398888 iphones success raised the bar of consumer expectations regarding mobile multimedia
3398889 handset manufacturers worldwide are in the midst of revamping their product lines against this new benchmark
3398890 it is difficult to create forecasts for mobile video and mobile tv advertising due to the fact that the market is still fragmented and undeveloped
3398891 until consumers are presented with a clear cut simple and inexpensive value model for accessing mobile video and tv content it will be hard to segment audiences at either an industry or geographic level

3398904 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best

3398917 centrist to progressives are buying into the moral goodness of faithful democrats sold repeatedly by a cast of evangelical and mainline religious leaders political liberals and quasi religious activists have been working non stop to recapture the flag of faith from the republicans who have let it fall from their grip

3398972 we suggest that malting barley growers continue dialogue with the malting companies as the appropriate forum for pricing issues and cease making ill considered allegations against parties who are not involved in the pricing discussions
3398973 growers here produce 250 000 tonnes of quality malting barley every year but find themselves at the mercy of large corporations which control the market
3398974 both diageo and greencore malt have agreed contracts that guarantee their margins and growers are entitled to the same conditions
3398975 based on the current price the growers share of the consumer price of the pint is a paltry 1 1 cent
3398976 over 70 of diageo irelands brewing production is for the export market and therefore it is vital to be competitive with european brewers in order to grow our business and continue to provide sustainable demand for our suppliers

3398979 while we have mitigated some of these cost increases through internal measures we must implement price increases to pass along these rising costs and return the business to margins that justify our continuing reinvestment unfortunately this means some customers will see price changes above 20

3398982 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3398983 these are the kinds of things you see in e mails that you see circulating about obama in this sort of subterranean smear campaign against him you never see these things voiced by the candidates
3398984 had sen clinton followed mark penns advice it would have caused her more angst than good
3398985 whats going on right now is that a lot of obama supporters and fundraisers are trying very hard to retire sen clintons debt one reason theyve had difficulty doing so is the dislike among obama people for mark penn specifically
3398986 they tend to blame him for the nature of these negative attacks
3398987 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3398988 this was a historic campaign people thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall and instead weve had this historic presidential election where shes collapsed and a first term senator has won the democratic nomination
3398989 so i think its just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated and theres certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened
3398990 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3398991 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3398992 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3398993 these kids down the street the rays have been playing well you cant take that away from them
3398994 but things happen sometimes experience shows up and takes over im not saying they will drop but if you go by the numbers that is normally what will happen always the guy with the more experience and the guy who has been in the same spot always takes over
3398995 experience only matters in the playoffs in the regular season anything can happen
3398996 i never showed any emotion when i got asked that before they play the game right when that happens thats the way its going to be
3398997 at the beginning of the year it was aw when are they going to drop off its the tampa bay rays but now i think everyone understands theyre a great team
3398998 if you think about it you start adding numbers the lead they have in this division right now it looks like them and anaheim have a better shot than 50 percent to make it to the playoffs

3399020 we know this is a difficult situation for our customers we know that but its the only responsible choice we can make because unlike citizens or the cat funds we cant have a low rate up front and charge the assessment afterwards we have to be ready to write that check as soon as the storm hits with money we have on hand

3399042 i think this is an incredibly efficient actually a scarily efficient way of organizing society thats actually being celebrated here which is a hybrid of some of the worst elements of authoritarian communism mass surveillance of the population total lack of civil liberties lack of a free press lack of democratic rights authoritarian central planning all harnessed not to advance the goals of social justice even in name although there may be some lip service still paid to that but to advance the goals of global capitalism so it is stalinism meets global capitalism there are 100 000 security officers just on olympic duty and to put that into perspective the stadium itself the birds nest stadium holds 90 000 so theres 90 000 spectators and 100 000 secret police keeping control of things in beijing so this is an incredible operation but when you hear people like lou dobbs and other commentators talking about the problems in china its always red china communist china or the chi coms and its really this blast from the past of you know its almost as if the cold war never ended

3399046 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3399047 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3399048 dire dental situation is emblematic of the larger health care crisis
3399049 this is just where all our national health care problems converge high costs lack of access
3399050 we like to believe that everyone can get the care they need
3399051 people who are low income work hard and dont have coverage through a job have to make harsh economic choices about their health care

3399061 i would play this but it just feels so old
3399062 we wanted something that the mom or dad whos bringing home for the family could say this is what i remember and this is what i want to play with my kids
3399063 at the same time we wanted something the kids would feel like it belonged to them and this is something thats very appealing to them so we tried to blend those two worlds it plays like clue it feels like clue but it just feels like clue that would have been created in the 21st century
3399064 we have two cartels fighting for control president calder n has taken the fight to them but serious challenges still exist to border security that must be met with a joint effort
3399065 we have asked mexico to assist in stopping the flow of drugs across our borders and they have done so extraordinarily well and at great cost to civilians and law enforcement officers targeted for execution and assassinations by the drug cartels what mexico asks us to do is something similar to halt the flow of guns into mexico

3399079 monday morning will seem a good bit brighter for drivers today with yet more welcome news from morrisons
3399080 weve proved it over and over again when the price of crude and refined product falls our customers are the first to see the price at the pumps fall as well with no catches

3399082 we have the examples of aimal kansi and an italian underworld don after whose execution italy stopped extraditing prisoners to the usa
3399083 aafia has been put in a new york jail was produced before a judge in new york and would be heard before a judge in new york while the public sentiment in new york was so anti aafia that the dailies have started calling aafia a suicide bomber
3399084 from me and my family we do not blame any muslim for what has been happening to our sister for the last five years our allah will take revenge for us
3399085 the government had been in contact with us during the last five years and has been saying that dr aafia would be back in a few days
3399086 now we have been told that all the three children were fine but looking at aafias condition we fear that the children might be in danger
3399087 it is immaterial who handed over aafia to the fbi but i am proud of being a pakistani after looking at the support from the civil society and the media and my heart wishes that i should go out and shout at the top of my voice that i am a proud pakistani a nation which has stood by its daughter
3399088 what i want is to bring aafia back to pakistan and i beg the media and the government to do something for aafia and bring her back
3399089 the americans would send her to jail for 40 years then what would we do aafia was not a green card holder then why she was being tried in new york

3399093 he pushes me hard he looks over every move i make
3399094 he had more drive he was more relaxed he is a great champion
3399095 salim hamdan was working for a bad organization and he knew that
3399096 i think we all had to reconcile that before we got on the plane
3399097 the defense would say the accused made the mistake of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
3399098 the prosecutors would give the image of him being a hardened terrorist
3399099 it came down to the evidence that we were allowed to see
3399100 i thought it was unusual considering the crimes he was accused of i know there are people who hate people or entities
3399101 the reality is he didnt have to get up at all he could have just sat there
3399102 the penalty should be so significant that it forecloses any possibility that he renews his ties with terrorism
3399103 unless you can say we should have hanged him are you going to make that same statement of every individual
3399104 just as we adhere to the geneva convention and we try to set the standards with the sanctity of human rights
3399105 you have to trust the government to a certain degree
3399106 i would take their word for it because yes i do believe in the government

3399110 mr mccain seems intent on reassuring skeptics that hes no george w bush if he loses in november hell prove it
3399111 the tribunal is illegal it is completely wrong as salim is not a member of al qaeda he was just an ordinary paid driver for sheikh osama he was not a fighter at all
3399112 hamdan spoke to his family three days before the oppressive verdict and he was not worried at all his family members including his wife and two daughters are of course outraged but have a strong faith in allah it was an accepted verdict
3399113 he salim gave me a lift in his bus and i was impressed by the way he drives i spoke to him about jihad and motivated him by lucrative payment
3399114 he took his family and naively decided to go back and return the money he has for others he was captured and sent to guantanamo prison
3399115 the us keeps many yemenis in this prison because it believes yemenis are the pillar of al qaeda serving as drivers and bodyguards and in other positions
3399116 the government is not working enough to get them back many governments in the region got their citizens yemenis there are now the majority at the same time the us government was not able to prove their involvement in terrorist activities
3399117 the us is demanding guarantees from yemen that freed detainees be placed under surveillance or jailed
3399118 the us government is in the process of negotiating with the yemeni government to find a solution that will allow all detainees to be returned in all cases the united states government is looking for a way in which we can transfer detainees to their home countries in such a way where the threat they pose is mitigated or accounted for in some way
3399119 they returnees are already under security surveillance they have to go to the intelligence and sign every time and then and sometimes they are summoned whenever needed by the intelligence however the safety of the detainees is not the primary concern of the us for what the harassment they face in yemen will not be worse that in guantanamo
3399120 i love the show that is my popcorn night with my girls

3399126 any invention or technology is an extension or a self amputation of our physical bodies and such extension also demands new ratios or new equilibriums among the other organs and extensions of the body
3399127 this is the sense of the narcissus myth the young mans image is a self amputation or extension induced by irritating pressures as counter irritant the image produces a generalized numbness or shock that declines recognition self amputation forbids self recognition

3399134 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
3399135 i really think it is a vindication for the system

3399144 synopsys has been alchips premier eda vendor since the very beginning
3399145 we trust synopsys comprehensive suite of high performance tools and their proactive technical support to tape out our complex socs on time with a solid track record of first silicon success nearly all of the major tapeouts in alchips history were designed with synopsys design tools with the adoption of the synopsys low power solution flow combined with alchips low power design expertise and techniques alchip has high confidence in our ability to address the increasing complexity of low power design and verification in 65nm and below
3399146 synopsys has a long history of successful collaboration with alchip and our companies have worked closely together on numerous tapeouts
3399147 alchips design requirements are growing increasingly complex and their latest generation of devices is expected to include 31 power domains this is an exponential increase in verification complexity compared to earlier designs by adopting the eclypse low power solution alchip is well positioned to meet these challenges while simultaneously reducing design turn around time

3399170 thats always been on our minds in terms of a scenario we could face
3399171 he will serve his time for the conviction and then he will still be an enemy combatant and as an enemy combatant the process for potential transfer or release will apply
3399172 it demonstrates at the very least that you cannot count on a military jury to throw the book at people
3399173 it doesnt demonstrate the wisdom of the process and it doesnt illustrate the fairness of the process
3399174 they understand chain of command and the relative roles of people and this guy was a nobody
3399175 it is really a question of how a military panel would view a four star generals driver he was a driver this is a decision consistent with their military training and understanding
3399176 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
3399177 that ought to be his sentence either we believe in american justice or we dont
3399178 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
3399179 but as an enemy combatant he then becomes eligible for the annual review board process to determine whether hes eligible for release or transfer

3399196 in the strange world of guantanamo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely
3399197 nowhere else in the us justice system can someone be held for life regardless of whether he is convicted or acquitted of a crime the outcome represents nothing more than an illusion of justice
3399198 it is time to shut down these commissions and put an end to this shameful chapter in american history

3399200 its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice
3399201 unlike senator obama i recognise that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
3399202 we are working to assess the situation and i would not want to speculate on the outcome

3399217 we chose wind river because of our successful past usage of vxworks and its forward looking product strategy that allows us to migrate to arinc 653 and secure multiple independent levels of security mils systems
3399218 in addition the platform enables reductions in device size weight and power thereby reducing significant design engineering and production risks
3399219 our vxworks 653 system removes the risk out of creating compact small footprint avionics systems making it the most compelling compute platform for complex flight critical systems involved in challenging missions such as unmanned systems like the x 47b n ucas
3399220 we are excited to work with northrop grumman and to provide our proven vxworks 653 solution for such an ambitious project that represents the future of unmanned systems technology

3399227 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems

3399229 russian officials believe that it was the u s a that orchestrated the current conflict the chairman of the state duma committee for security vladimir vasilyev believes that the current conflict is south ossetia is very reminiscent of the wars in iraq and kosovo
3399230 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the u s department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the georgian military force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
3399231 known that the georgian troops had conducted volley fire cleansings of several south ossetian settlements where peoples houses were simply leveled
3399232 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in the hundreds and even in the thousands
3399233 i have been trying to figure out who is at fault for what is happening in south ossetia state television claims the blame lies with georgian president mikhail saakashvili and his supporters in the west however i have long ago stopped believing state television reports even when their statements seem to be true
3399234 i heard the following objective information prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitri medvedev accuse georgia of carrying out genocide in south ossetia while saakashvili blames russian aggression heart rending images of the violence filled the screen with no comment as the only explanation
3399235 had barely stepped through the gate when he said dont ask me whats going on
3399236 philosophical regarding my question of who was the first to attack tskhinvali it occurred to me that we buried one of the early 20th century soviet dictator josef stalins greatest opponents alexander solzhenitsyn last week but the tensions that stalin had stirred up were continuing to exert their influence it was stalin who laid down the illogical borders between the former soviet republics he did so based on the belief that they were so unnatural nobody would ever dream of trying to tamper with them understanding what terrible consequences would result
3399237 in this conflict has been manifestly led by the prime minister vladimir putin rather than by dmitri medvedev his successor as president
3399238 consider very carefully where its wholly disproportionate action is going to leave its standing in the world
3399239 could seize back control of south ossetia which was lost in 1992 after the break up of the soviet union led to the fragmentation of some of its former republics it could be as he claims that tbilisi was responding to provocations by russias allies in the rebel province either way he miscalculated for georgia that probably means the loss of all south ossetian territory and maybe more
3399240 spreading to abkhazia the other georgian enclave that was prized away from tbilisi by moscow but while saakashvili looks reckless moscows response using vastly superior forces not only to drive georgian troops out of the devastated south ossetian capital of tskhinvali but also to pound civilian and military targets inside georgia itself makes putin and medvedev look like the rogues in this deadly and lamentable affair
3399241 osama bin laden has done more for european integration than anyone since jacques delors
3399242 i have heard it from those who knew i have heard it i have received it from where there is wisdom
3399243 what i am telling is the original truth i am telling it for the first time and nobody has ever said it before me
3399244 do you think you are saying something new what you are saying is nothing new to people
3399245 parli discuti dibatti cerchi di mostrare che quello il tuo pensiero no nessun pensiero tuo nessun pensiero originale tutti sono presi a prestito e non sono neanche di seconda mano perch sono stati di milioni di persone prima di te osho
3399246 lho sentito da coloro che lo sapevano lho sentito lho ricevuto dal luogo da cui la saggezza proviene
3399247 se fosse vero non diresti cos non vero che sai perch in te lio esiste ancora
3399248 quanto sto dicendo la verit originale la racconto io per la prima volta nessuno lha mai pronunciata prima di me
3399249 pensi forse di dire qualcosa di nuovo quanto stai dicendo non affatto nuovo alla gente
3399250 imagine having a computer system that keeps track of every event thought image or desire that had ever transpired in the earth imagine as well that rather than simply a compilation of written data and words this system contains countless videotape films and pictures providing the viewer with an eyewitness account of all that had ever happened within any historical time frame finally imagine that this enormous database not only keeps track of the information from an objective perspective but also maintains the perspectives and emotions of every individual involved as incredible as it may sound this description gives a fairly accurate representation of the akashic records
3399251 though they were systematically dehumanized to me they became like friends or brothers or fathers and uncles
3399252 she was hanging inside the house with steven and with kelly klein nearly the entire time nobody could go inside the house they had security blocking the way it was so rude
3399253 when we make the only choice possible and that is to love then all of us become what we were intended to be
3399254 between may 2007 to may 2008 i didnt did you the project by the cwa aims to make sure every one in america has access to affordable high speed internet heres a link to the full report
3399255 loan to value ratios and underwriting standards are strictly enforced by a single strong regulator
3399256 i would dearly love to meet someone who i can spend the rest of my life with and have that companionship with
3399257 i havent done it yet but i will do what i need to do to keep looking good
3399258 i feel guilty because i havent done it and my reasons for not doing it are questionable because why wouldnt i in this world there are young women coming through hollywood but perhaps i have waited to long for botox
3399259 i know i definitely need to have my eyes done but then i go and talk to the doctor and i am like cant i put this off a year they just keep telling me if i go ahead i will have less to do later on
3399260 its a fantastic part where else in the world could a woman get to play all ages and all different backgrounds except
3399261 women my age arent meant to be active its the first love scene i have played in a long time
3399262 if you look at what we know about men women and our sexuality a majority of people are bisexual
3399263 it was the happiest day of my life working on set with my daughter
3399264 i remember we were having dinner the night before and she said mum i hope i dont disappoint you but i just said i hoped i didnt disappoint her
3399265 it was really weird because it was a big dramatic scene and she was very very angry at me and in between takes i would go over and say why are you so angry
3399266 i got caught in the moment it was just so weird
3399267 when i was little i used to start my sentences with my brother this or my brother that because i used to idolise my brothers
3399268 they are both older than me so i grew up doing a lot of the things that they did
3399269 when i was 12 i started mountain bike racing i did that for 13 years and that started a bit of an outdoor adventure obsession for me
3399270 i guess you could say i was a bit of a tomboy i know that sounds cliched but its true
3399271 when i was little all i wanted to wear was frilly dresses
3399272 but i spent my first four years living in canberra and melbourne so my compromise to mum was wearing a skivvy under the dress so i would have this summer dress on with a skivvy underneath and i would be purple because it was so cold
3399273 my friend and i used to take those big blue shells the type that kids take to the beach we would tie a rope to it and go out on the brisbane river and wait for boats to come past and sink us
3399274 i have been bungee jumping three times twice on the gold coast and once from the macau tower in macau
3399275 the macau tower is 283m high and it was the scariest thing i have ever done in my life and i dont know if i could ever do it again
3399276 its the highest free standing bungee jump in the world and you are standing up there and all you can hear is the wind roaring in your ears
3399277 you are standing on a 60cm by 60cm platform with nothing around you but space
3399278 it feels like you are standing on the edge of the world and when you jump you free fall for three or four seconds
3399279 when you are actually falling you are fine it almost feels like a relief because that comes after the moment thats called the point of no return
3399280 its the moment when your brain comprehends that you cant go back its when you start the fall and your body is at about a 45 degree angle
3399281 its when your brain kicks into panic but then a few seconds later its all over and you are left wondering what just happened
3399282 i still dont think weve played anywhere close to our best basketball
3399283 ein neues kapitel der solidarit t wird wichtiger auch st dte wie duisburg gelsenkirchen bremerhaven oder das ehemalige zonenrandgebiet in bayern brauchen finanzhilfen wir m ssen vermeiden dass sich dort genau die disparit ten entwickeln die wir heute im osten haben
3399284 in den neuen l ndern gibt es fl chenhaften leerstand von wohnungen im westen dagegen nur einige strukturschwache gebiete
3399285 aber viele st dte w ren froh wenn sie noch ihre alten kerne h tten die es im osten h ufig noch gibt
3399286 the foolish man seeks happiness in the distance the wise grows it under his feet
3399287 found that happiness is not the result of economic or social circumstances but rather how each one of us chooses to react to those circumstances
3399288 explains that being kind to others whether friends or strangers triggers a cascade of positive feelings it makes you feel compassionate and capable and gives you a greater sense of connection with others both of which are happiness boosters
3399289 explains that people are very poor at predicting how happy theyll be under different circumstances
3399290 if we dont do a better job of addressing this housing crisis its going to continue to drag the housing market the credit market and the economy into an abyss
3399291 and that house just got bigger and bigger until it imploded on itself
3399292 this winter we could see thousands of families who cannot afford to heat their homes be required to live in community shelters
3399293 even after we work our way out of this mortgage crisis the energy crisis will still be with us
3399294 at this juncture its important for people in minority communities to know these issues are going on the impact these issues have and to take an active role in guiding policy particularly people in the real estate community
3399295 by meeting like this theres a possibility we could come away with some answers
3399296 status of and outlook for house price appreciation home sales and a a homeownership in national and selected metro area housing markets
3399297 even after we work our way out of this mortgage crisis the energy crisis will still be with us
3399298 es importante que la justicia investigue qu manipulaci n de testigos han hecho por ejemplo la senadora piedad c rdoba el senador gustavo petro es bien importante hacer eso
3399299 si tiene elementos como funcionario o ciudadano que los ponga en conocimiento de las autoridades porque si eso no ocurre me ver a en la situaci n de instaurar una demanda por calumnia e injuria ante la comisi n de acusaci n de la c mara de representantes
3399300 hay sectores del gobierno y en general del estado que est n interesados en que las investigaciones no contin en
3399301 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3399302 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3399303 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean
3399304 wars to watch out for 2008 will bring us an abundant crop of overseas crises
3399305 the real aggressor georgian invasion of south ossetia sets the stage for a wider war
3399306 with the georgian military just as the crisis reaches a crescendo of violence the brits to their credit have
3399307 new variety of premium grapes debuted in japan on monday with a single bunch fetching as much as 100 000 910
3399308 japanese hotel manager paid that amount or about 2 860 26 per grape for a 1 1 2 pound 700 gram bunch of the ruby roman grapes to serve guests at an upscale hotel
3399309 total number of sectors 7831520 not a multiple of sectors per track 63
3399310 life cannot get better than this im thrilled about winning the gold its very difficult to describe how i feel because the winning moment is yet to sink in i guess it was my day today
3399311 i know my country was yearning for this medal a very long time after missing a medal at athens by a whisker i knew i had to win here
3399312 after having qualified fourth for the final i knew i had to go all out my start wasnt impressive but things started looking up soon
3399313 this is just the beginning i want to win more olympic medals but i hope my victory today will make people pay more attention to olympic sports

3399317 it should have been easy to see that this bubble could not be sustained
3399318 when you own a property you own the rights to future appreciation when you rent you have no such rights
3399319 the cost of owning and renting can diverge if people expect significant appreciation in a market
3399320 why is housing so expensive in san francisco and so cheap in pittsburgh one way is that house prices dont make sense another is that buyers expect healthy appreciation
3399321 for one the homeowner gets a shield on the cost of owning a house because of the tax deductability of the payment
3399322 two if the person is in a rising market then his or her equity will increase

3399327 owning a home means much more than not paying rent home ownership is the key to building the wealth that pays for college supports retirement and is reinvested in communities
3399328 all across america we are saving this must stop we are calling upon the mortgage lenders to eliminate their discriminatory policies and practices
3399329 we are now in the middle of the biggest crisis that has hit middle class americans since the great depression
3399330 we have turned property ownership into a nightmare this lawsuit is critical because we must send a message to the bad actors in the corporate community who have been engaged in this and to government at every level
3399331 when two people go in to get a mortgage and one winds up with a mortgage at a better rate and another one winds up with a mortgage at subprime rate and the only difference is the color of their skin then somethings wrong
3399332 if you look at where the bulk of mortgage foreclosures are they are in communities that are african american and latino in brooklyn and new york city
3399333 owning a home means much more than not paying rent home ownership is the key to building the wealth that pays for college supports retirement and is reinvested in communities
3399334 all across america we are saving this must stop we are calling upon the mortgage lenders to eliminate their discriminatory policies and practices
3399335 we are now in the middle of the biggest crisis that has hit middle class americans since the great depression
3399336 we have turned property ownership into a nightmare this lawsuit is critical because we must send a message to the bad actors in the corporate community who have been engaged in this and to government at every level
3399337 it was racist when they redlined our community we couldnt get loans because of racist lending policies because we were black and latino it is racist now that any and everybody can get a loan they are doing this in the black and latino communities its called reverse redlining we need to have these loans restructured
3399338 when two people go in to get a mortgage and one winds up with a mortgage at a better rate and another one winds up with a mortgage at subprime rate and the only difference is the color of their skin then somethings wrong
3399339 if you look at where the bulk of mortgage foreclosures are they are in communities that are african american and latino in brooklyn and new york city
3399340 can solid state nuclear fusion reactor be the ultimate green energy solution
3399341 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way
3399342 lenders and borrowers alike were caught up in the speculative frenzy that has harmed the housing market and it is not the responsibility of the american public to spare them from the consequences of their own bad judgment
3399343 our attorney told us that the opposing attorney had told him that if we didnt take this last offer that they would send a team of attorneys to the little town we were living in california they would get a yearbook they would start interviewing every student in the yearbook to try to dig up any dirt on her or on us as a family
3399344 improper activity occurs frequently aboard ships but goes unreported and or unpunished
3399345 crew members generally understand that if they commit an offense and are caught they are most likely going to lose their job and be returned home but not spend time in jail
3399346 there is an active organized stalking if you want to call it that or targeting as i call it of females that come aboard cruise ships its start from the first day and it doesnt stop until the voyage is ended at the end of the week
3399347 you can invite them all you want but i can tell you right now they probably wont respond
3399348 one kick hes in here and he comes he stands right here and he called tammy a name and that was it boom like right there
3399349 why are people getting put on hold this is an emergency number there should be no hold there should be a person answering that phone 24 7
3399350 i know its my daughter but its also for the community to understand that hey 911 wasnt working and please understand that
3399351 mistakes were made and we systemically in the service knew we had to do a better job
3399352 im not a real religious person and please dont take me wrong but i think god made a mistake that day i really do what happened to her shouldnt have happened to her
3399353 the tragedy that should never have happened a cruel experiment
3399354 i think these children would have been better off if they had never been
3399355 the bottom line is that they will never go anywhere they will not have a life worth living
3399356 every decision ive made ive always thought of the girls ive never thought of myself
3399357 theyre not monsters theyre just little girls they just happened to be joined at the head
3399358 i just want everyone to take a good look at the girls and if youve seen them you would fall in love instantaneously and i think they just need to open their eyes and see them for what they are
3399359 we came to the conclusion that there wasnt an opportunity to do this without significant risk to both twins
3399360 if she didnt have her sister attached to her shed be gone
3399361 something is going to come up someone is going to find out how to help these babies they have all the doctors in the world working on this
3399362 americans aim to reduce carbon footprints despite drop in concern for climate change
3399363 a database search finds 50 percent fewer news stories on global warming in the month before this poll was conducted compared with the month before last years survey
3399364 that we hope demonstrates that we can work together to solve the issues of homelessness in the context of community care in its fullest sense
3399365 i feel confident that chl will be able to handle that aspect of this program
3399366 were delighted with the outcome and happy to work with everyone to get
3399367 the neighborhood has never opposed housing the homeless we just need security and measures put in place to reassure that our neighborhood will continue to maintain a harmonious co existence with the spencer house
3399368 im looking forward to it being there i think it would make a nice addition to the neighborhood
3399369 yeah hes kind of his own man right now every now and again hell come up with an idea and i dont think anything has come out of that yet but were still working with him
3399370 were just seeing a huge increase in the number of people desperate for help
3399371 perfect storm of things that are coming together that impact
3399372 people who have never gone to a food bank before are going to food banks
3399373 theyre couch surfing thats a horrible way to raise a family
3399374 people with kids will do just about anything not to let people know they are homeless
3399375 i have heard many people discussing with our volunteers and our staff members how hard it is to pay their rent and how worried they are
3399376 month to month it increases dramatically it looks to me like the economy is getting worse rapidly
3399377 im more concerned with the marginal families who have a job
3399378 we give food boxes to the working poor theyre right on the edge were kind of the last stage
3399379 will provide a real shot in the arm for the housing industry
3399380 the 7 500 first time buyer tax credit is the centrepiece of this effort and it will stimulate home buying and reduce the inventory of unsold homes
3399381 a significant financial incentive that will increase housing demand and get home buyers back into the market and shore up home prices
3399382 within nine months that tax credit helped clear off a record number of unsold homes and helped the country dig its way out of a recession
3399383 will restore consumer confidence reduce inventories and send a signal that the housing sector is at bottom or very near the bottom
3399384 i am an autistic girl who has learned to spell and can tell people to stop looking at me like i am helpless i am cute funny and i like to have fun
3399385 we realized inside was this intelligent articulate emotive person we had never met it was just unbelievable because it opened up a whole new way of looking at her
3399386 it feels like my legs are on fire and a million ants are crawling up my arms
3399387 it supports the notion for me that you cant give up on these children because it is the cumulative effect of a lot of time and energy that have gone into her
3399388 if you dont start planning for these things now you start creating hurdles and roadblocks to a future system
3399389 if we would think as a region instead of as individual cities towns and villages we would think big and would consider projects with great costs but with even greater benefits like rail
3399390 when we upgrade and build sidewalks on a suburban road suddenly there are many more pedestrians
3399391 if there were a rail line and it went up say as far as saratoga springs i would definitely ride it to go out downtown at night and during the racing season instead of driving
3399392 i would imagine there would be more transfer points and it would take longer on bus
3399393 most big transportation initiatives around the country were done as much for subjective reasons as for objective reasons
3399394 you have to have a champion and you have to have a sense of urgency or crisis
3399395 you have to have an initiative that resonates with the sensibilities of the area
3399396 the investment im really interested in is a commuting light rail system between albany and saratoga
3399397 because its a significant investment it would have to be an investment from the state and it would have to be a vision of the governor
3399398 the question of whether or not there is a market for such service has never been studied properly
3399399 it just leaves us with a situation where a 30 million project is a big lift
3399400 simcha felder is an independent thinker who makes decisions the same way i do by simply doing what he thinks is right for the people he represents i rely on simchas advice on issues big and small because he is honest fair and speaks his mind openly
3399401 honesty openness and fairness are all too often absent in albany but that will start to change if brooklyn democrats vote to send simcha felder to the state senate in september
3399402 it is a great honor to receive mayor bloombergs endorsement
3399403 he has great appeal among voters across the city because he thinks independently and works cooperatively to create positive change for the people of new york city i have had the pleasure of working closely with the mayor in creating this change while emulating these same ideals in the new york city council
3399404 we have enough game ideas to do geometry wars for probably about 10 games it depends on what will work
3399405 he pokes his head out occasionally but thats about it
3399406 free sippy cup thermal freezer bag or cooler lunch bag
3399407 jo and siennas dad ed had a few concerns as any parents would but sienna convinced jo she is happy so shes happy for her daughter
3399408 sienna knew they would get on really well balthazar is a lovely guy
3399409 balthazar thinks its a bit soon for sienna to meet his children that is something that will come with time but he is obviously secure enough in their relationship to want to show off his new love to his friends
3399410 i get asked about beyonce all the time but i try and make fun of it
3399411 sometimes i say shes not my sister other times i say ive stuffed her in my suitcase and sent it to dubai
3399412 i have to have fun with it or ill turn into britney shave my head and go totally crazy
3399413 i get a lot of wrinkled noses because of how outspoken i am
3399414 big green challenge was launched to encourage communities to come together to generate new ideas on how to save the planet we had an amazing response from a wide cross section of groups and these 21 finalists prove that new ideas to tackle climate change can be found within our own communities too often people only associate innovation with technology the big green challenge shows that people powered social innovation can make a difference to the big issues of today
3399415 i am delighted that stephen has agreed to serve on the nesta board the knowledge and experience of the trustees makes a vital contribution to nesta through its work to transform the uks capacity for innovation by investing in early stage companies informing and influencing policy and delivering practical programmes to help innovation flourish nesta is one of our key partners at the department for innovation universities and skills with the publication of our white paper innovation nation in march we have a challenging and exciting agenda ahead nesta has an important role to play in implementing the recommendations to develop an innovation index and to establish a public services innovation laboratory
3399416 stephen is an eminent scientist who has played a leading role in driving the uks innovation agenda his appointment is a welcome addition to an already impressive board of trustees who possess the vision skills and experience to lead nesta in its quest to help the uk meet the innovation challenges of the 21st century
3399417 with this project maryland heights can build on its legacy as a premier area of hospitality business and entertainment
3399418 with the flood protection and the traffic infrastructure this has became an ideal location
3399419 its a very different place than say queeny park or forest park
3399420 like those it is a refuge but what makes it different is theres so much more open space around it take away that open space and you just ruin the park experience
3399421 they may call it a 500 year levee but i think we were all recently reminded of what flooding rivers tend to do to earthen levees
3399422 i would expect that what we would build would accentuate the park
3399423 we want to make it friendly for people to come from the park for a cup of coffee and vice versa for people who live and work at the development to go to the park
3399424 not only would that spoil the serenity of the park but it would hurt other businesses in the city particularly west port plaza
3399425 the city should be treating creve coeur park as its jewel and putting their redevelopment efforts toward established businesses before they turn into urban blight
3399426 theres already a degree of obsolescence in the west port area but that doesnt make it unviable and we dont want to lose it
3399427 were looking at redoing the west port plan with an eye away from the office warehouse stuff and more toward flex space for a site that would be attractive to lots of startup businesses
3399428 if someones ready for treatment today if they have to even wait sometimes 24 to 48 hours that window is gone and then we would have to wait until they approach us again
3399429 one of my officers who emailed i think at 1 54 in the morning
3399430 he said thats hes done he doesnt know what to do anymore after he drove around for a couple of hours with a prostitute who said she wanted help and he could not get her help and dropped her off at the same corner i mean ill tell you the frustration in that email i think is what you hear in our officers voices everyday
3399431 these people are our kids out there and we have given up on them
3399432 cari amici grazie per tutto questi giorni finiscono ma porto con me un tesoro di ricordi
3399433 solo adesso vedo quale esercito di angeli custodi mi ha circondato
3399434 saluto tutti i cittadini di bressanone anche io adesso sono un cittadino di bressanone
3399435 paolo vi fra lostracismo del clero e quello dei mass media
3399436 uno dei messaggi principali che il santo padre trasmette nei suoi scritti e nei suoi discorsi hanno scritto quello del dialogo ecumenico della tolleranza e della comprensione reciproca tra i popoli le religioni e le culture si tratta di un messaggio che trova ampio riscontro anche nella storia di bressanone quale cerniera tra la cultura romanica e germanica e luogo di convivenza tra diversi gruppi linguistici nonch nellimpegno della citt sancito nel recente piano di sviluppo a diventare un centro del dialogo interreligioso
3399437 bressanone un luogo di incontro tra le culture rappresentate anche dalle tre lingue parlate qui
3399438 ha detto eccola qua lidea che a volte ci manca sia in campo civile che in campo ecclesiale la multicultura pu essere faticosa ma ne vale sempre la pena
3399439 so far this year more than 1 25 million americans faced the risk of loosing their homes to foreclosure up 7 3 from june 2008 and up 88 62 from july 2007
3399440 the nations southwest and southeast regions have been hardest hit with three and four times the number of pre foreclosures in july 2008 than in the northeast and midwest southwest 86 625 southeast 65 458 northeast 20 541 midwest 19 640
3399441 looking at pre foreclosure filings as a percent of households the best way to judge future foreclosure trends this year 7 2 out of every 1 000 house holds nationwide faced possible foreclosure
3399442 again numbers in the nations southwest and southeast were up big at least almost double those in the northeast and midwest as overextended homeowners in nevada arizona florida and california led the nation pre foreclosure problems
3399443 short term theres no question that the foreclosure outlook is grim
3399444 foreclosures and short sales selling homes for less than their loan value make up a huge chunk of todays sales market and those low sales prices are skewing sales values down
3399445 but thanks to the new housing bill recently passed first time home buyers are coming into the market to grab their 7 500 tax credits fha reform is easing their loan process and there is a ton of affordable housing to chose from plus for the first time in a long time you can buy a near new home for less than its replacement cost
3399446 anda tidak mungkin mempersiapkan diri hanya beberapa bulan sebelum olimpiade
3399447 anda tidak mungkin berharap untuk menang dan meraih medali olimpiade melawan negara yang telah mempersiapkan diri selama bertahun tahun
3399448 keuangan juga menjadi hambatan jika anda tidak membayar gaji pemain dengan memadai jangan berharap terlalu banyak dari mereka
3399449 ada banyak bakat di afrika tapi anda butuh lebih dari itu untuk bisa berhasil di olimpiade
3399450 anda harusnya tidak perlu mengkhawatirkan tentang apakah anda akan dibayar atau tidak atau apakah anda bisa mengumpulkan uang untuk ikut kompetisi keadaan seperti itu sangat sulit bagi beberapa dari kami karena kami juga punya tanggungan keluarga
3399451 kami tidak mau menekan mereka jadi kami tidak mengatakan hadiah apa yang akan mereka dapat seandainya mereka meraih medali yang pasti mereka akan mendapat sesuatu
3399452 dalam undang undang nomor 10 tahun 2008 tentang pemilu anggota dpr dprd dan dpd jelas disebutkan bahwa pedoman teknis terkait pencalonan ada pada kewenangan kpu
3399453 untuk mendukung prinsip keadilan tentunya tidak diperkenankan menggunakan fasilitas negara
3399454 memang tidak diatur dalam undang undang tentang pejabat pemerintah mereka tidak perlu mundur hanya cuti saat kampanye sama seperti pejabat negara
3399455 im watching womens beach volleyball and it only comes on in 4 years

3399680 hamdan could be held indefinitely as an enemy combatant but the political explosion that option would touch off makes it all but untenable
3399681 defense department officials said there are concerns about the public perception of holding hamdan after his prison term runs out
3399682 because it could label the military commissions a show process with no meaning to its sentences
3399683 said it has always been the defense departments position that detainees could be held as enemy combatants even after acquittal at military commissions or after serving a prison sentence
3399684 thats always been on our minds in terms of a scenario we could face
3399685 will serve his time for the conviction and then he will still be an enemy combatant and as an enemy combatant the process for potential transfer or release will apply
3399686 it would be totally unfair for the government to hold hamdan indefinitely
3399687 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
3399688 that ought to be his sentence either we believe in american justice or we dont
3399689 the president may yet try to extend mr hamdans detention
3399690 the supreme court has determined that the executive may hold without charge those such as mr hamdan designated as enemy combatants
3399691 it would be unnecessary and unwise to exercise that power in mr hamdans case to hold a man who has been judged to be of minimal risk to the country would make a mockery of the legal proceedings just completed
3399692 said he would not want to speculate about whether mr hamdan would be released at the end of his sentence
3399693 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
3399694 i n the twisted world of mr bushs prison camps
3399695 it is unclear if mr hamdan will be released after serving his sentence
3399696 captured the absurdity of the proceedings perfectly on thursday night when he called the trial the most historic session of traffic court ever
3399697 mr bushs hapless and often unconstitutional approach to combating terrorism will leave his successor a great deal of work to do the rule of law including fair and open trials must be restored guant namo needs to be shut down as mr mccain has said many times detainees must be put on trial quickly in real courts and those who are not guilty must be freed mr bushs supporters have been crowing over the hamdan verdict as if it were some kind of a triumph in truth it is a hollow victory in the war on terror a blow to americas standards of justice and image in the world
3399698 it has been suggested that this trial at least demonstrates that the commission system is fair unfortunately though the white house has left open the possibility that it will keep hamdan in prison indefinitely even after he has completed his prison sentence this sounds like some scenario out of a third world dictatorship it threatens to make a mockery out of the trial and those expected to follow once the government has submitted a case to a judicial process created by the bush administration itself the president should at least agree to abide by the results
3399699 it follows that the government should release him after he completes his sentence by years end to do otherwise to continue to hold him as an enemy combatant for the duration of the so called war on terror as the bush administration has insisted it can would be absurd if the result of his trial and its sentence do not affect the term of his confinement what was the point
3399700 the rules in this game are not the same as in the civilian courts
3399701 stacked in the governments favor and constitutional rights do not apply
3399702 nevertheless the jury of officers weighed that evidence carefully and rejected the pleas of the government that hamdan be convicted as a terrorist conspirator and sentenced to life in prison these are military officers who must understand better than most that a terrorist released from custody could return to fighting the united states and killing americans by their verdicts and sentence they signalled that they believed the defense argument that hamdan is a small fish not a terrorist shark who just wants to go back to his family in yemen the bush administration should respect those officers judgment

3399705 speak to voters on a personal level we also know he is leveraging technology and the idea that he understands technology users and that he has a great pr team
3399706 not so long ago i was making 400 a week i was drowning in debt
3399707 intended no message to the bush administration or comment on its military commission system
3399708 the panel looked at the evidence against salim hamdan and found it simply didnt support prosecutors depiction of a hard core al qaeda terrorist who hates america and its way of life
3399709 salim hamdan was working for a bad organization and he knew that
3399710 came to view him like other young people who get mixed up in criminal organizations because they are ignorant or lack other opportunities rather than through a deep seated ideology
3399711 principally involved driving mr bin laden and other al qaeda figures around afghanistan
3399712 soon became cooperative and provided information to us interrogators about the al qaeda organization
3399713 put on a slew of witnesses including some of its top counter terrorism agents mockups of surface to air missiles it said were found in mr hamdans car and video of his initial interrogations in 2001
3399714 were barely if at all aware of the cases historic background
3399715 after years of contentious debate over detainee treatment it was good to finally see prisoners handled through an organized process rather than an indiscriminate way
3399716 necessary to keep feelings about 9 11 and other al qaeda attacks from interfering with their judgment
3399717 i think we all had to reconcile that before we got on the plane to guant namo
3399718 from opening statement to sentencing argument both the prosecution and defense were very aggressive
3399719 the defense would say the accused made the mistake of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
3399720 the prosecutors would give the image of him being a hardened terrorist
3399721 it came down to the evidence that we were allowed to see
3399722 n o evidence suggested mr hamdan had any role in planning or organizing any terror attacks
3399723 stood and apologized again and thanked the jury and judge
3399724 i thought it was unusual considering the crimes he was accused of
3399725 the reality is he didnt have to get up at all he could have just sat there
3399726 so significant that it forecloses any possibility that he renews his ties with terrorism
3399727 didnt accept the premise mr hamdan may have been guilty but where was his act along the spectrum of things one could do in support of terrorism
3399728 we adhere to the geneva convention and we try to set the standards with the sanctity of human rights
3399729 but said that continuing to hold mr hamdan past his sentence was acceptable if officials so concluded
3399730 you have to trust the government to a certain degree
3399731 i would take their word for it because yes i do believe in the government
3399732 some trial observers wondered if the jury intended any message by selecting that date
3399733 people probably are trying to read too much into it
3399734 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
3399735 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him your sentence should say the united states will hunt you down and give you a harsh but appropriate sentence if you provide material support for terrorism
3399736 your sentence will be their justice your work is our justice and you shouldnt flinch from it
3399737 godspeed mr hamdan i hope the day comes that you are able to return to your wife and daughters and your country
3399738 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
3399739 to hold a man who has been judged to be of minimal risk to the country would make a mockery of the legal proceedings just completed

3399749 jeffrey wells the blogger you had on is typical of soulless hollywood elites who have neither capacity nor desire to understand beyond their point of view
3399750 you had on a hollywood spinmeister two used the stolen election line twice and you didnt challenge him
3399751 the next time someone says we went into iraq under false pretenses please point out bill clinton said saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction too
3399752 jeffrey wells makes hateful comments about conservatives and then says he didnt mean it that way and didnt want to hurt anyone hypocrisy is sad
3399753 you asked the hollywood blogger why he hates conservatives that was astoundingly hypocritical considering your show is dedicated to demonizing liberals
3399754 hollywood and the left in general have a hatred not seen since 1859 as the country teetered on the brink of civil war
3399755 what a contrast from the generation of actors who volunteered to serve during world war ii and the mealy mouthed guys who fill the big screen today
3399756 im sick and tired of liberal fascists who try to censor any ideas that dont toe the party line pithy enough
3399757 jeffrey wells is the perfect liberal he feels but doesnt think hes also quick to try to wiggle out of any accountability for what he says
3399758 your interview demonstrated the intellectual bankruptcy hypocrisy and intolerance of opposing views by the left there is no bigot like a liberal bigot
3399759 the blogs and airwaves have become cesspools of hatred how many generations must be held accountable for the injustices of the past
3399760 mr wells comments about jon voight certainly werent tolerant the fact that it was done on a blog is no excuse

3399775 editors note this image it turns out is not what we first reported the european space agency said may 19 that what they first declared to be the great wall is instead a river the following image of the day text appears as it was originally published
3399776 according to astronomers the only work of mans hands which would be visible to the human eye from the moon is the great wall of china
3399777 stretching from chinese turkestan to the pacific in a line of well over 2 000 miles nearly a tenth of the earths circumference the wall has been considered the only work of man which can be picked out by martian astronomers

3399785 this is a whole new ball game its not a question of simply being more efficient than low cost competitors from so called emerging economies because of the rapidly changing nature of high technology sectors they are now competing with us on an equal footing

3399831 the federal reserve is freeing up vast amounts of money to help the banks but the fed can only do so much too much money pumped into the economy will drive up inflation at the same time businesses are finding it harder to borrow which threatens overall economic activity its a fine line

3399849 i write to you on behalf of aafia siddiqui phd a 36 year old muslim woman and pakistani citizen who is in pre trial detention at the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn new york dr siddiqui is not allowed by the federal bureau of prisons bop to have contact visits that is she is not allowed to come into physical contact with anyone
3399850 despite this the bop and staff at the mdc are insisting that dr siddiqui endure the humiliation of a so called strip search each and every time one of her lawyers come to visit her for purposes of defending her in the united states district court on criminal charges
3399851 the inmate is required to be stripped naked and checked to find he she is not hiding anything on his her body
3399852 i think you will agree that this type of strip search is not only humiliating and degrading but is also offensive to a woman who is a devout muslim as is dr siddiqui
3399853 because it is so offensive dr siddiqui is now refusing to undergo this procedure and because she will no longer consent she is now forbidden from having a contact visit with her attorneys
3399854 in addition neither you husain haqqani nor any representative of the pakistani government will be permitted to visit dr siddiqui to perform your diplomatic duties so long as she will not consent to a strip search

3399856 sexually explicit literature comes in various genres and genders these days
3399857 o ne genre which interests me is male male erotic romance
3399858 explained that heterosexual men who largely ruled the world were squicked by images of men with men but no one was squicked or threatened by images of women with women or by more conventional sex men and women together provided there was no coercion or incest
3399859 both the history and the appeal of m m erotic romance are clearly complex
3399860 the motives of women who write sex scenes featuring two or more male characters have never seemed self evident to me
3399861 describing bodies which are different from ones own is bound to be a challenge
3399862 t here seems to be no corresponding genre of f f erotic romance written by men aside from the work of a few very versatile writers such as m christian
3399863 and if it is true as i suspect that fantasy literature has had an influence on this genre
3399864 writers of m m romance are not trapped in the pillory of historical reality anyway
3399865 choosing to write about males need not be based on an aversion to females
3399866 but several women writers have explained why they write m m by explaining why they dont write erotica about female characters
3399867 these reasons are based on the supposed negative qualities of women in general or of supposedly unbreakable female roles
3399868 i like reading and writing about men more than i like reading and writing about women
3399869 in addition to the claim that actual women in the past lacked the independence to inspire fiction centering on female characters
3399870 several writers have mentioned the difficulty of writing sex scenes involving females who can still be respected afterward this looks to me like an internalized double standard presented as an objective fact
3399871 it is clear to me by now that i cant find a non controversial way to report other writers squicks
3399872 men are approximately half the human race and no more than that women are approximately half and no less
3399873 the occasional lurid accident which happens when a sadomasochistic scene goes wrong is overshadowed by the constant nonconsensual institutionally enforced oppression of whole demographics in most cultures on earth
3399874 is culturally taught and enforced it is not instinctive in all people most of whom are not white
3399875 human beings are sexual and complicated and these qualities can be found in the literature they write thats my view and im sticking to it

3399889 the installation of our system on board emirates boeing 777 aircraft is another first for aeromobile and clearly demonstrates our ability to offer our technology to airlines using either boeing or airbus aircraft the number of boeing 777s operated by emirates and other aeromobile customers means that this introduction is a key step in allowing passengers to keep in touch when they fly
3399890 there has been overwhelmingly positive feedback since the service launched in march with between 40 to 60 per cent of passengers switching on their phones on flights where the service is available
3399891 i think this series is obviously the one that meant the most to us it has taken a very long time to get hold of the trophy
3399892 so far i think this is the most successful south african season we have probably ever had
3399893 so credit to the team in the way they have developed the collective team effort in regards to performance over that period of time
3399894 when you go to pakistan then to india and then you come here those are three massive challenges within a period of time
3399895 and when you have won two out of the three series and drawn the other one that is a side that is definitely on the up
3399896 i think the confidence that we have gained from winning the series is an important facet for us going to australia
3399897 that has been the really tough place to play skill wise mentally and physically
3399898 it is still too early to say anything about the differences in their leadership
3399899 the team plays in a certain way i think kevin will find that over time he has obviously had success in his first game but he seems to be a much more positive confident guy on the field
3399900 he might just as well meet the challenges that are coming up for him in a very positive way
3399901 russia has invaded a sovereign state such an action is not acceptable in the 21st century
3399902 promart and trade routes filled an important diplomatic and foreign affairs function by helping build cultural bridges for canada
3399903 canadians take pride in our vibrant arts and culture community and are eager to showcase canadian culture for the rest of the world eroding canadas capacity for cultural diplomacy is simply bad foreign policy
3399904 what does this government have against artists and the cultural community
3399905 a very special love hits p134 million in 2 weeks
3399906 i dont think theres any doubt who is still by far the most powerful and influential person in russia
3399907 of course we have to deal with russia and we deal with putin
3399908 but it has to be on a very realistic basis and not one that theres any illusions about his ambitions
3399909 will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3399910 but when it comes to his record american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain

3399917 i am very excited to be participating in crucible 2008 its an excellent opportunity to combine my knowledge and expertise with that of researchers from fields that i may never have had the chance to work in im sure that the innovative new ideas we generate could go some way to shaping future advances
3399918 there are many challenges that cannot be solved by experts from one discipline alone crucible aims to overcome this by connecting different types of researchers in a way that will stimulate exciting new collaborations and spark new ideas this sort of research increases our ability to provide radical solutions to todays most pressing social and economic challenges
3399919 my inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release hamdan at the end of his sentence but the next one might
3399920 i think hamdans continued detention past the end of his sentence although justifiable under the law of war would be a political train wreck and i think the panel made an effort to protect the u s from further international criticism
3399921 for seven years uniformed military officers have pushed back against the administrations most extreme and unlawful detention and interrogation policies only to be overruled by white house lawyers with little respect for the constitution or geneva conventions
3399922 we may never know what the commission members were thinking but we saw what they did they ensured that mr hamdans fate will be determined by a future administration with more respect for the rule of law
3399923 holding hamdan past the end of his term is only going to further inflame anti american feelings in the muslim world where the u s will clearly be perceived as continuing to discriminate on the basis of nationality or religion
3399924 kadix systems customer presence significantly increases the percentage of our business mix focused on high growth markets a key strategic focus for drc

3399926 menjadi sempurna adalah sia sia bagi manusia manapun di muka bumi ini tuhan menciptakan manusia dengan banyak kekurangan tentu bukanlah sebuah ketidaksengajaan namun dengan suatu ukuran yang sangat menakjubkan mata bagi orang orang yang bisa melihat dengan hati mereka bisa menyaksikan meskipun tidak bisa melihat menyimak meskipun mereka tidak bisa mendengar dan mengucap meskipun mereka tak mampu berbicara mereka juga manusia mereka sama dengan kita dengan anda sadarkah anda
3399927 setiap manusia dilengkapi dengan kekurangan agar dia tidak sombong setiap manusia dianugerahi kelebihan supaya tidak minder tuhan mahaadil siapapun dia telah memiliki apa yang di sebut takdir namun kesalahan seringkali menghantui manusia manusia yang terlalu percaya pada takdir padahal tuhan telah mengilhamkan dua potensi pada diri setiap manusia adalah potensi untuk menjadi buruk begitupula potensi untuk menjadi baik bagi manusia yang hanya bergantung pada takdir cukuplah bagi dia berdiam diri di dalam goa yang gelap dan penat jauh dari hingar bingar dunia dan berkata ah takdirku memang begini hidup atau tak hidup juga sama saja dan dengan seperti itu dia sudah merasa bukan bagian dari dunia ini juga tidak tau kemana akan melangkah setelah ia beranjak meninggalkan dunia ini
3399928 adakah yang tersirat dalam benak anda sebagai anak manusia apakah itu takdir apakah itu ketetapan tuhan apakah semua manusia terlahir dengan kecerdasan yang luar biasa seperti einstein apakah semua makhluk memiliki sayap sehingga mampu terbang tinggi layaknya seekor burung elang apakah setiap bayi yang dilahirkan ke dunia ini mendapat tempat yang layak sebagai tempat tidurnya setelah keluar dari rahim ibunda yang begitu nyaman apakah semua manusia yang bekerja keras itu selalu kaya raya dan orang yang hanya ongkan ongkang itu selalu melarat

3399949 la politique imp rialiste de la russie les polonais et les baltes ont des fronti res communes avec la russie ils sidentifient facilement avec les g orgiens quils voient comme des victimes de la puissance militaire russe
