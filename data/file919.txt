9190003 i am just a girl waiting for a man to love me
9190004 it is possible to master leadership under conditions of shared responsibility
9190005 throughout my 20 years in the field ive found one fundamental principle that accounts for the difference between truly great team builders and those who are average struggling or failing the difference is in how they deal with personal and shared responsibility effective teams feel it on effective teams if one person drops the ball another picks it up and if one person makes a mistake or falls behind another lends a hand low and average performing teams seem to lack this sense of shared responsibility i developed the knowledge team leadership program to give team leaders and members the tools they need to deliver results and have fun with any team starting immediately
9190006 the powerful teams ive created since attending this seminar five years ago have delivered almost every project run on time and on budget and employee retention has been excellent

9190011 the permafrost now has small holes we have found elevated levels of methane above the water surface and even more in the water just below it is obvious that the source is the seabed
9190012 data from an air force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that gustav continues to rapidly strengthen and now has maximum winds 115 miles 185 kilometres per hour with higher gusts

9190017 reduced alcohol taxes private imports from abroad and across the internet longer opening hours at systembolaget and an increase in the number of restaurants granted liquor licenses
9190018 the firefly populations have dropped 70 percent in the past three years
9190019 when you talk to old people about fireflies it is always the same
9190020 they saw so many when they were young and now they are lucky now if they see one
9190021 i know of populations that have disappeared on my farm because of development and light pollution
9190022 its these mcmansions with their floodlights one house has 32 lights why do you need so many lights
9190023 researchers hope this would allow us to track firefly populations over many years to determine if they are remaining stable or disappearing

9190035 with the help of genes we have been able to minimise the loss caused by the fungus ug99 the genes in indian wheat prevent the fungus from causing any harm
9190036 as an immediate relief measure chemical control technology is also available to ensure that this race does not spread and cause damage
9190037 as a precautionary measure a special team has been constituted to survey and monitor the summer wheat crop in the higher hills of himachal pradesh jammu and kashmir southern hills in tamil nadu to detect and track down ug99 or its variants

9190045 they discussed issues pertaining to jammu and kashmir orissa and bihar situations and other issues of national and international importance
9190046 we are hopeful that this normalcy could be achieved within next week to 10 days
9190047 well may not be june but i mean signs of normalcy in the sense what you can
9190048 it was blockade of the srinagar national highway that created confusion we are trying to reduce agitation in jammu
9190049 certainly we are unhappy about it but the situation is nowhere close to what it was in 1990s
9190050 i am on record on saying that we would like to know who did the shooting it wasnt done by the police
9190051 this is the concern even amongst the hurriyat and others saying that who is now amongst us who is trying to eliminate some of us
9190052 youll know at the right time when we are sure of who it is or which group was responsible
9190053 no we have no facts at the moment about a or b or c what we are clear at the moment is this was not the police
9190054 he aziz is not the martyr to the cause he has been made out to be he was shot in the back it was certainly not the police
9190055 as the situation showed marked improvement in these areas we extended the curfew relaxation periods in all city police station areas to eight hours from 11 a m to 7 p m
9190056 in areas under khanyar and rainawari police stations where curfew had not been relaxed earlier in the day we relaxed it from 5 p m to 7 p m
9190057 the situation remained peaceful during the relaxation period except an incident of stone pelting in rajouri kadal area of the old city which was brought under control by a mild baton charge
9190058 the minorities should not be treated as cannon fodder to carry out the agenda of vested interests in sabotaging the peoples movement of kashmir
9190059 the team is winning despite not having played much competitive footbal for long i have no complains
9190060 this tournament is very important for us we didnt get much practice for this tournament and if we do well here the boys will gain confidence ahead of the i league
9190061 i have no doubts about the fact that the steep price hike was artificial created at the behest of the centre to benefit the middle man from whom the congress party has to collect funds for the next general elections due in 2009
9190062 take for instance the case of price rise of sugar which went up by rs 300 per quintal just because of the less release of quota by the centre after a week the prices again went down when enough quota was released but the sugar lobby earned crores tens of millions during the week when artificial shortage was created
9190063 now when the prices of oil have gone down by 35 percent in the international market why are the prices here not reducing in the same proportion
9190064 israil had been constantly on the move due to the mounting police pressure he shifted to south india to evade arrest following a tip off a delhi police team left for coimbatore where israil was hiding after gang leader bunty was shot dead
9190065 he israil was brought to delhi saturday morning and the police are interrogating him
9190066 following the information all the guest houses and hotels in the town were checked and specifically the hotels providing north indian food were provided with photographs and briefed about israil
9190067 based on the clues provided by the local people the team intercepted him at a bus stop in coimbatore the accused had completely changed his appearance by sporting a beard and ponytail he had also learnt some sentences in tamil and tried to confuse police
9190068 he was an illustrious son of india he helped the government in every crisis
9190069 he was a doyen of indian industry and a great human being and philanthropist he made valuable contributions as a parliamentarian and his political speeches on economic matters are priceless
9190070 his death is an irreparable loss to the business community as well as society he made india proud during its difficult times he was a nation builder
9190071 fortunately i am working in the same city where k k birla worked so long i have seen him working intensely till the last phase of life he was a man of great substance i have seen very few people so much in love with work
9190072 the nhai officials have given us a letter saying the makeshift podiums of the trinamool congress and other political parties along the durgapur expressway are illegal constructions

9190074 we would do a gathering sunday evening to garner support in favour of industrialisation in the state this is an independent initiative of professionals from all segments of society and well wishers of the state of west bengal
9190075 we expect a turnout of at least 2 000 people for this rally
9190076 in recent times there has been a campaign to create an environment in which establishment of new industries in our state is projected to be against the interests of the people of west bengal the confusions created in the process have gone to the extent of subverting even the success of such a pioneering effort as the nano factory at singur
9190077 our government would ensure that no virus of polio could enter the territory of national capital for making a strong nation we must have strong children which would only be possible with the success of polio programme

9190087 the drought in the sahel in the 1970s created a shortage of watering holes
9190088 sometimes the elephants even break into our reserves and chase people to get the fruits because they dont have enough water
9190089 the problem we have is the lack of water we have excellent pasture but there is often not enough water for elephants and humans to share
9190090 the best water sources are hidden in the forest and the elephants open it up by trampling down the bush and exposing the grass to light they break off small branches which goats cannot reach often youll see a herder with his goats following the elephants through the forest
9190091 many herders and farmers take the arrival of the elephants as the start of the rainy season they wont plant until they see them because the elephants wont move until theyre sure they can find water
9190092 we are developing a tourist industry here based on wildlife in a way similar to safari

9190147 this investment in smartcard technology for canadas capital is just one more example of the provinces commitment to strengthen public transit in ottawa and throughout ontario
9190148 the provinces contribution underlines their commitment to the future of public transit in ottawa and i am grateful to premier mcguinty and minister watson for their support
9190149 the introduction of the smartcard is yet another step forward in the evolution of e service in ottawa at some point this same technology could be expanded to pay for parking tickets admission to city facilities or even public skating

9190164 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9190165 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9190166 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9190167 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9190168 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what
9190169 if youre going to dance youve got to pay the fiddler

9190174 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9190175 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9190176 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9190177 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9190178 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9190179 to insist harper take immediate action to put inspectors on the floor of meat processing plants
9190180 to very quickly restore the confidence of canadians and more importantly to protect canadians
9190181 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9190182 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9190183 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9190184 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on

9190203 you know flirting with freshmen for a t shirt and some booze pretty much makes you a booth babe and puts you one shirt shy of prostitute gloria steinem would be spinning in her grave were she not still alive then again people like would argue that your ability to lure and manipulate foolish aroused men with nothing more than the possibility of your favor is the oldest and most affirming form of true power of course since youve stated explicitly that youre doing it for booze and clothing instead of for yourself were pretty much back to whore arent we

9190206 we need to think harder we need to do better
9190207 in mature systems the benefits of new infrastructure in an already well served area are elusive
9190208 whether high speed rail is a new story or simply the final chapter to the history of conventional passenger rail waits to be seen
9190209 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9190210 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9190211 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9190212 the problem is there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9190213 i wish to humbly apologize to society for my crime
9190214 every human life is sacred i took the life of a human being and im very sorry for that
9190215 where can i get me a cool red panda figure like the one pictured here
9190216 data from an air force reconnaissance aircraft indicate that gustav continues to rapidly strengthen and now has maximum winds 115 miles 185 kilometres per hour with higher gusts
9190217 it will produce a storm surge and torrential rains in the western part of the country
9190218 i am concerned that there are still a number of persons who are still unaccounted for
9190219 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9190220 savage barbecue race culture and the invention of americas first food
9190221 has yet to escape the fraught implications of savagery and cannibalism inbuilt and original to its name
9190222 wedded to the ascent of new notions of racial exoticism and mastery
9190223 with the savage barbecuing of meat both belong to the production of a new imperial supremacy that can corrupt those it empowers
9190224 the editors of dictionaries and encyclopedias would perhaps view the inferential character of this argument with some suspicion
9190225 you can argue all you want about whether russias response was justified but it is crystal clear that saakashvili is at fault for starting this conflict
9190226 in 1945 those russian barbarians used unjustified force to savagely violate germanys territorial integrity and they pushed its duly elected chancellor to suicide
9190227 georgia started it and i think all discussions about who is right or wrong in this conflict should be based on that

9190266 first quarter results are below last years results and early expectations the primary influence was the effect on the net interest margin brought about by the actions of the federal reserve in january and march to lower short term rates
9190267 the fed actions precipitated cuts in prime which had an immediate negative impact on the margin while we expect to recover margin as the year unfolds its effect is evident
9190268 we are pleased with deposit growth and especially in cash type deposits that is relationship based transaction and non maturity type deposits with deposits being up 4 05 since the end of the year and almost 9 00 from the year ago quarter this results from a specific strategic focus on building these types of relationship deposit accounts
9190269 in an economic slowdown beginning with and being most severe in the real estate sector we expect some adverse trends in asset quality m amp f is proactive in risk management loan review and credit administration no opportunity to serve the credit needs of worthy borrowers will be missed furthermore our capital and reserves are sufficient to weather this storm

9190277 rayonier has been a great conservation partner over the years and we thank them for graciously agreeing to sell these important tracts to us
9190278 the nature conservancys acquisition of lands within the blackwater river state forest is a real win win for the military mission and conservation
9190279 sustaining natural areas beneath our low level military airspace ensures our nations war fighters can continue to train as they are expected to fight while at the same time preserving our regions rich natural resources
9190280 the rayonier tracts are such important pieces of the puzzle and add so much value to the adjoining state forest land
9190281 the sale of these properties to the nature conservancy directly benefits the ecology and people of the panhandle region and was made possible by true partnership from both sides rayonier is proud of its presence in florida and is pleased to help the nature conservancy preserve the native forest terrain that makes the state so unique

9190284 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9190285 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9190286 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden

9190308 what they did for us in there was pretty outstanding the trouble they went to
9190309 he thought he jones might be a risk to me
9190310 he should do his time first i think they should have thought a bit more about what they were doing
9190311 there were a number of investigations made to ensure the bride or any other family members including children were not at risk
9190312 well all my teachers really know their subject matter and im interested in my classes we do stuff every day that helps me learn
9190313 who are you and what did you do with dd1 and dd2
9190314 so you dont see adventure guy as the head of your household
9190315 well what exactly is it im giving up by not being the head of the household
9190316 and no suitable helper was found so god made a woman
9190317 if tears could build a stairway and memories build a lane i would walk up to heaven and bring you home again
9190318 apparently there is a quick simple and undetectable way to
9190319 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9190320 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9190321 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9190322 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9190323 no one works for someone we all just work together
9190324 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9190325 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9190326 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9190327 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9190328 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9190329 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9190330 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9190331 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9190332 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9190333 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9190334 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9190335 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9190336 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9190337 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9190338 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9190339 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9190340 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9190341 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9190342 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9190343 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9190344 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9190345 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9190346 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9190347 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9190348 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9190349 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9190350 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9190351 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9190352 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9190353 je pr cise que le monsieur il portait une casquette

9190355 ben non cest un portable le clavier il est int gr je peux pas le changer
9190356 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9190357 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9190358 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9190359 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9190360 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9190361 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9190362 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9190363 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9190364 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9190365 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9190366 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9190367 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9190368 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9190369 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9190370 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9190371 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9190372 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9190373 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9190374 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9190375 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9190376 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9190377 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9190378 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9190379 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9190380 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9190381 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9190382 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9190383 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9190384 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9190385 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9190386 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9190387 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9190388 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9190389 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9190390 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9190391 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9190392 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9190393 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9190394 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9190395 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9190396 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9190397 because both russia and norway have an interest in the development of the european oil and gas market
9190398 and we welcome them into the market because the market will be bigger if there are several suppliers
9190399 we are a reliable supplier and we have proved that over many years and we have a very transparent open energy sector
9190400 the situation is very interesting for norway of course we are looked upon as a stable nation whereas russia still has a tainted reputation in that respect so i think we will try to prove that we are a stable producer of oil and gas for europe
9190401 the ukraine issue sent a shiver down the european energy spine and georgia is a recent episode which will focus a lot of minds
9190402 i think we have to be how can i put it streetwise when it comes to issues around energy security norway is a great partner to have its a very sophisticated democracy with a great record when it comes to human rights so the new pipeline is a good piece of democratic politics
9190403 we are disappointed and concerned over north koreas decision to suspend the decommissioning of nuclear facilities in yongbyon
9190404 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9190405 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9190406 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9190407 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9190408 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9190409 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9190410 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9190411 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9190412 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9190413 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9190414 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9190415 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9190416 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9190417 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9190418 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9190419 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9190420 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9190421 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9190422 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9190423 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9190424 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9190425 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9190426 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9190427 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9190428 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9190429 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9190430 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9190431 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9190432 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9190433 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9190434 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9190435 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9190436 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9190437 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9190438 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9190439 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9190440 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9190441 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9190442 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9190443 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9190444 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9190445 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9190446 the proper venue for that is the court i will only submit myself to investigation or interrogation only if it will be done through court proceedings
9190447 it is already outside the power of congress to intervene in such matters which are being treated as a political issue
9190448 not one of them is even my congressman they should not interfere on things like this what they should attend to are the needs of their respective constituents
9190449 fernando has not attended the hearings before the chr showing his disregard not only for the rule of law but also for his responsibility to account and be responsible for his actions and the enforcement and implementation by his men
9190450 very highhanded their approach is authoritarian and that is not good the illegal settlers should be helped not treated that way it has become really alarming
9190451 should not employ excessive or unnecessary violence on street vendors and resort to the destruction of their means of livelihood nor resort to illegal or unlawful means in carrying out their functions
9190452 the patently harsh and whimsical method by which the mmda is carrying out its operations constitutes human rights violations
9190453 we will give him fernando the benefit of the doubt that the proposed radio station is not in pursuit of his political plans
9190454 were hoping that its going to settle down enough that we can do some damage assessment
9190455 im expecting the hms iron duke early and theyre going to be providing significant assistance in our damage assessment operations
9190456 i am concerned that there are still a number of persons who are still unaccounted for
9190457 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9190458 we already wrote to icmp to conduct dna test on the body of the victim i believe they have better advanced facilities and theyre better experienced in handling such cases
9190459 we hope that through this we will be able to finally confirm or negate the identity of the victim
9190460 shes a fresh new face in a party thats dying for one the antidote to boring white men
9190461 i think were going to have to examine our tag line dangerously inexperienced
9190462 palin has announced plans to create a new sub cabinet group of advisors to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions within alaska
9190463 fear is constantly generated by politicians to rally the support of the people environmentalists go back and forth from warning about a coming ice age to arguing the grave dangers of global warming
9190464 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9190465 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9190466 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9190467 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9190468 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9190469 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country

9190505 esordio tutto sommato amaro contro una cremonese che ha ampiamente meritato di vincere anche se noi qualcosa gli abbiamo concesso in fatto di regali ad una corazzata come quella grigiorossa non puoi assolutamente lasciare la minima chance che subito ti trafigge i miei ragazzi hanno forse sentito la pressione del debutto casalingo e del blasone dellavversario comunque nulla da obiettare agli avversari che hanno davvero giocato bene per noi gi domenica prossima importante fare punti
9190506 ottimo esordio della squadra sono davvero soddisfatto per come abbiamo preparato questa gara in settimana la squadra complice anche il caldo ha giocato meglio nel primo tempo dove siamo stati pi brillanti giudizio sul nostro girone ci sono squadre blasonate con una grande tradizione anche tra le neopromosse come spal e reggiana sar davvero un bel campionato
9190507 before the internet we only had access to peoples eyes and ears via their living rooms that was enough for us to suck out their souls and we did that
9190508 then came the internet and social networks now the internet is like a needle that lets us get inside our consumers into their bloodstream now we can move around inside them and look for that soul less void we left and put up our billboards right there
9190509 billboards saying we can make it alright again buy more of our stuff it is environmentally friendly now and you can buy it with one click it is brilliant it is branding on the inside i can sell anything to anyone now just let me make friends with them on facebook first

9190513 talk radio will represent american interests in our nations capital at a critical time and provide people all across the country an opportunity to make their voices heard on immigration and as immigration is a critical national security issue hold their feet to the fire will coincide with the seventh anniversary of 9 11
9190514 powerful special interests are now in full force pushing for amnesty and foreign guest workers with no regard to the plight of the american worker wages or a deteriorating economy
9190515 the politicians arent talking about it radio talk hosts representing millions of listeners will and their collective voice is a voice that roars
9190516 we have addressed emergency plans in each location and have contacted high acuity patients to make sure they are safe and understand their own evacuation plans
9190517 we have also connected those patients with other locations around the region we have contacted all our oxygen patients and explained to them that we have set up at least 12 depots in local towns where they can come by and get supplies if needed
9190518 with the lessons we learned from katrina and other hurricanes we feel that we are prepared to handle anything that is thrown at us
9190519 being prepared in advance can greatly reduce stress and anxiety as well as protect lives and property
9190520 in times like this the red cross is not only there to provide food water and shelter we are also a shoulder to lean on during difficult times
9190521 media will be able to arrange interviews and tours of mall of america at our reporters retreat
9190522 this is a great opportunity for visiting media to take a break from the rnc and see what mall of america has to offer its visitors and the great state of minnesota well also provide great story ideas to reporters and unique media experiences not available to the public weve already been contacted by media outlets from across the country and throughout the world and it appears the reporters retreat is going to be a real hit
9190523 we have been anticipating heavy network traffic for months and methodically increased our network capacity to accommodate the expected network usage of technologically savvy attendees
9190524 we are very pleased that we were able to meet the demand and keep our customers connected to their world while attending this exciting event

9190529 will what i choose be for the greater glory of god
9190530 do not make any choices in times of depression and or desolation
9190531 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9190532 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9190533 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9190534 but there are things we can and will do better
9190535 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason
9190536 and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9190537 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of to the club

9190542 the millennial student generation in general seems to want to work as partners with the administration and be a part of the system instead of having a significant separatist mind set that is us against them
9190543 these students now seem to want to have a place at the table where the decisions are being made and do it a little more civilly
9190544 it wasnt just sitting on a patio with banners and drums and signs
9190545 it was sitting in offices with people over a cup of coffee and saying how do we do this
9190546 the social justice network at eastern was in some ways calling for our own conversion and for the conversion of the university
9190547 it wasnt about just doing good things it was about repenting and converting as an institution and seeing that as a more compelling way to engage the world
9190548 i noticed the way that protesting tends to polarize and pit people against one another
9190549 that was the last thing i wanted to see happen at eastern so i thought that conversation and listening to one another was a finer route
9190550 none of us really knew what in the world we were doing
9190551 but we understood that we were involved in a mutually transformative process
9190552 we approached the administration with a high degree of professionalism and flexibility
9190553 the attitude that was mirrored back to us was one of cooperation
9190554 the successful campaigns that i see are the ones that are constantly engaging people
9190555 youre not fighting a battle youre in conversation with people and youre seeking your own conversion as much as theirs
9190556 it confused us how such a big project with such large ramifications could slip by in the planning stages so quietly
9190557 but even more we were wounded by what we perceived to be actions that ran counter to our christian principles and the beliefs that we were being taught in the classroom
9190558 first understand the issue and its complexities and let influential campus figures know that we care about the building project second use the main media source on campus the school newspaper to raise awareness and educate the student body third build alliances with groups of students and faculty that support our stance fourth motivate and mobilize our organization and our allies to directly confront students staff and faculty through a petition drive fifth let our opposition know our particular stance and what we would support engage them with the reasoning for why we hold these beliefs and show that our position is grounded in a christian call to protect creation
9190559 i think so but the woods are gone and its a daily reminder for me of what was lost and can never be recovered
9190560 the question isnt about effectiveness necessarily in the short term but overall effectiveness in the long term and what effect does this have on the student
9190561 it has clearly shaped the trajectory of boumas life and how he is going about his work of kingdom making and kingdom participation
9190562 we felt like what was taking place on campus was simply a microcosm of the wayward planning schemes that were chewing up farms open spaces and natural areas around grand rapids and throughout the country
9190563 we thought that calvin should be held to a higher standard than the bottom line
9190564 to be radical is good it means you are willing to take risks for what is right you are willing to face the consequences for what is good but it is important not to be radical for the sake of being radical let the message guide you
9190565 they were so keen on the actions that they had lost the message
9190566 we want people to look beyond themselves to see human need human pain and environmental pain and work for its resolution not for themselves to feel better but because as christians we are called to care for creation and care for our neighbors
9190567 there are no band aid solutions of throwing money at the problem or driving environmentally friendly cars or turning food into fuel rather it takes a complete transformation of lifestyle and a completely different way of thinking and responding to problems
9190568 the word that jumps out at me is contemplative or having the ability to reflect and also act
9190569 what we try and encourage as an administration is to have that activism come from the deep well of contemplation and reflection on the world if it doesnt come from that it can collapse into almost a vice of trying to save the world or a kind of workaholism
9190570 i think that was a wonderful example of student activism done in a way that allowed the institution to embrace it
9190571 it was done with some diplomacy and some critical questions being raised what we try and do with students is never thwart their enthusiasm for social change we want them to be in many ways working with us on these things at this university we have learned much from our students and their activism
9190572 or else we read closely to colossians its an empire reconstructing or system reconstructing generation
9190573 i think the word that has gotten a lot more play in our generation would be progressives
9190574 but i think weve done way more deconstructing than progressing and we are ironically probably a movement uncomfortable with labels
9190575 how about confidently confused and contemplative activists who feel more inspired by thomas merton than karl marx and who are more comfortable working for change by drinking fair trade coffee with administrators than standing around with angry signs but who sometimes do that anyway because hey we have an image to uphold
9190576 the conventions web site will enable americans to log on experience the convention as it happens and learn about john mccains unparalleled record of service and sacrifice the site will offer unprecedented access to convention proceedings and will help demonstrate why john mccain is best qualified to lead our country
9190577 fundamentally altered the conditions in which during 17 years attempts were made to the settle the relations between south ossetia abkhazia and georgia

9190579 today after seven days curfew has been relaxed from 11 a m to 1 p m and it is very natural that when we have come out of our homes after seven days we are happy as we feel free to breath in fresh air
9190580 if they would have given us little more relaxation then the people could have bought medicine milk and other commodities of daily use
9190581 even though he dalai lama is in mumbai he is taking part in this day long fasting from mumbai itself so we are praying for his speedy recovery
9190582 there has been no relief from the government there are no medical facilities and the hospital and the police station are left locked
9190583 the situation is grim as floodwater has entered our homes people have lost their belongings as well as relatives
9190584 we have left our place as we were left with no place to live floodwater is present everywhere
9190585 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9190586 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not
9190587 im enjoying the challenge and im delighted to still have a sniff
9190588 ollies favourite but ill see if i can make him sweat a bit
9190589 its a big day the culmination of a years worth of golf comes down to one day
9190590 i played wonderfully today and made nothing the longest putt was the five footer on the last
9190591 think that second life is a safe haven for your kids
9190592 we will open 100 new branches this year including 28 branches in punjab haryana and himachal pradesh during this year
9190593 and yet shes made her mark fighting oil industry corruption of alaskas politics and raised taxes on big oil to the benefit of the people who elected her to office
9190594 if you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival
9190595 the secret of happiness is freedom and the secret of freedom is courage

9190606 i played wonderfully today and made nothing the longest putt was the five footer on the last
9190607 i was so tired first thing i put so much into the first two days but then woke up around 2am wide awake
9190608 i got back to sleep about 5 30am and then woke up again at six but i played nicely and im in a good position now

9190617 all the records for the station were lost all our computers were lost
9190618 eventually the front of the building had to be torn down thats where all of the offices were
9190619 we do have temporary utilities coming in to the building
9190620 it always has seemed to me that the proper role of government is to find ways of helping and what fema seemed to be saying is were the government and were here to find ways not to help you and thats just wrong
9190621 fema has been extraordinarily creative and flexible in its application of public assistance funding in louisiana and the gulf coast and if there was a way fema couldve assisted wyes tv with public funding we wouldve found it and applied it
9190622 if the building had simply burned down prior to katrina we couldve rebuilt
9190623 how are we going to build 60 percent of a facility
9190624 we did not get the fema funding so we are not whole
9190625 everybody else can receive fema help arts organizations parks libraries
9190626 we as management and board are not real fond of earmarks the porky legislative trick by which home projects get financed by elected officials but if there were ever a poster child for earmarks its us

9190635 its not easy but we made a commitment just as you did today and although its not easy this is all part of loving someone with all your heart and with all you have to give its a promise that should last a lifetime it defines you a a person and describes your soul its a promise to be there one for the other no matter what happens no matter who falls for better or for worse dears for better or for worse
9190636 alaskans are calling for a complete and fair investigation into why walt monegan was fired and if it had anything to do with trooper mike wooten
9190637 i was going to vote for hillary clinton now i will vote for sarah
9190638 who better to woo disgruntled hillary clinton supports who said that they cannot support barack obama than a working mother of five children one of whom is in iraq
9190639 no experience never heard of her governor for a year and a half
9190640 if something did happen to him i dont think this woman is anywhere near qualified to be president
9190641 mccain likes to talk about obamas inexperience and he may not be wrong about that
9190642 but to take someone with even less experience and put them a heartbeat away from the presidency is just hypocritical
9190643 my main concern was that mccain was going to pick either a liberal like sen joseph lieberman or tom ridge or a flip flopper like mitt romney
9190644 im definitely going to vote for mccain now i think him showing that he is willing to pick a woman when my own party wouldnt reach out to her that cements it for me
9190645 shame on you john mccain not for choosing a woman but for thinking america is stupid its pretty clear this is nothing more than a political game all this is is a gimmick
9190646 this is a big positive and shake up for the campaign i have been researching her for the past week what a remarkable and courageous woman five children one being deployed to iraq and one with downs fighting to change the status quo in her state
9190647 i have never been this excited about politics in my life i am so pleased that john mccain has asked sarah palin to be his running mate not only does this lock in the hilary clinton supporters but we now have our foot in the door of alaska and drilling many people dont think that this has helped him but john mccain has made a great decision
9190648 now i feel more comfortable voting for mccain a woman brings a lot to the table and i look forward to getting to know her i think her inexperience in foreign affairs is very similar to obamas i believe she will bring the change this country needs

9190814 debemos sigue todorov a los formalistas una teor a elaborada de la literatura que deb a ensamblarse naturalmente con una
9190815 un principio adoptado desde el comienzo por los formalistas es el de colocar la obra en el centro de sus preocupaciones reh yen el enfoque psicol gico filos fico o sociol gico que reg a entonces la critica rusa
9190816 los rasgos objetivos del ritmo po tico son dice eichembaum seg n tinianov la unidad y la continuidad de la sucesi n r tmica en relaci n directa de una con otra
9190817 el inter s por la persona del escritor y del artista aumenta a medida que el campo intelectual y art stico gana autonom a
9190818 el an lisis sociol gico se expone a caer en los impecables errores de una sociograf a hiperempirista
9190819 bajo la inspiraci n de las impresionantes realizaciones te ricas de la ciencia natural se han construido repetidamente vastos sistemas de
9190820 nagel 1991 404 y este m todo formal es en este sentido muchas veces una
9190821 de los formalistas es la discusi n tanto la oral como la reflejada en sus escritos
9190822 se encuentra all la complementariedad necesaria de las diversas perspectivas
9190823 el subrayado es nuestro jakobson 1970 09 desde el comienzo entonces e incluso en sus puntos m s discutibles el formalismo ruso se erige como una f sica social espejo metodol gico de las ciencias naturales y esta condici n especular del formalismo queda de manifiesto en la descripci n de sus procedimientos describir la fabricaci n de la obra en t rminos t cnicos
9190824 colocar a la obra literaria en el centro de la atenci n examinar sin prejuicios su materia y construcci n
9190825 un conocimiento es cient fico siempre y cuando demuestre ser capaz de hacer aquello que las ciencias naturales hacen y lo que las ciencias naturales hacen es formular hip tesis generales que aspiren a convertirse en leyes universales con amplio poder de explicaci n y predicci n
9190826 el dominio del ordenamiento social donde se desarrollan los hechos
9190827 ni las cosmovisiones ni las creencias ni los difusos estados de animo ideol gicos se dan en el interior de las mentes o en las almas de las personas nicamente llegan a ser una realidad ideol gica al plasmarse mediante las palabras las acciones mediante un material s gnico determinado
9190828 propia de las experiencias de laboratorio de una supuesta situaci n de aislamiento
9190829 la estructura de la nueva cr tica ten a que erigirse sobre los s lidos cimientos del estudio cient fico de los hechos este empirismo militante por no decir ingenuo de los portavoces formalistas depend a estrechamente de su orientaci n futurista
9190830 este principio no excluye los diferentes enfoques de un mismo objeto
9190831 son textos de autores diferentes escritos a lo largo de un per odo de diez a os al mismo tiempo permanecemos fieles de esta manera al esp ritu de los formalistas que siempre rehusaron dar forma definitiva e indiscutible a los resultados adquiridos
9190832 lo peor a mi criterio es presentar a la ciencia como definitiva
9190833 nos sentimos libres con respecto a nuestras propias teor as y toda ciencia deber a serlo pensamos en la medida en que existe diferencia entre teor a y convicci n
9190834 eichembaum 1970 22 y en estas l neas podemos pensar que incluso su posici n revolucionaria tampoco es ingenua en tanto lo que el formalismo viene a proponer como reemplazo de teor as anteriores lo sabe potencialmente perecedero
9190835 las digresiones l ricas remplazan a menudo la argumentaci n fundada propia del razonamiento cient fico
9190836 debe estar preparada para pasar de una a otra metodolog a de la manera m s r pida e inesperada
9190837 en efecto podemos integrar en el an lisis todo nivel de significaci n que encontremos til aislar el car cter del c digo nos indicar los medios y las t cnicas a utilizar
9190838 consist a en un estudio de las particularidades intr nsecas del arte literario y no en la fijaci n de un m todo formal inmutable
9190839 que puedan trabarnos e impedirnos el acceso a los hechos los hechos pueden reclamar que los principios sean modificados corregidos o complicados
9190840 en un momento en que lo nuevo era indiscriminadamente bien recibido y lo antiguo desde ado el experimento formal parec a una necesidad hist rica
9190841 no se trata en el trabajo cient fico de comunicar un conocimiento que ha tomado ya su forma definitiva sino de crear una obra de escribir un libro
9190842 una producci n una construcci n por tanto de ninguna manera una simple constataci n de algo preconstituido
9190843 la historia literaria en la medida en que tiene un car cter especifico y dentro de los limites en los cuales es aut noma y no depende directamente de otras series culturales
9190844 de diferentes procedimientos utilizados para la construcci n del tema construcci n escalonada paralelismo encuadre enumeraci n nos ha llevado a percibir la diferencia entre los
9190845 las operaciones y mediciones que realiza un cient fico en el laboratorio no son lo dado por la experiencia sino m s bien lo reunido con dificultad
9190846 para los formalistas lo esencial no es el problema del m todo en los estudios literarios sino el de la literatura considerada como objeto de estudio
9190847 de una objetividad emp rica pretendidamente libre de toda interferencia incluso en las ciencias naturales
9190848 la noci n de obst culo epistemol gico plan de obra

9190994 jika tak mengingat dua anak yang menjadi tanggung jawab saya maka saya akan langsung putuskan untuk meninggalkan suami saya
9190995 sebenarnya adakah hal positif yang ada pada diri suami anda
9190996 hmmm ya sebenarnya dia itu sabar dan baik dia mengurus banyak hal tanpa pernah mengeluh satu satunya hal yang sering dia keluhkan adalah kecerewetan saya namun dia seringkali menyinggung perasaan saya saya adalah tulang punggung ekonomi keluarga saya sih tidak masalah dengan hal itu marilah kita sama sama berbagi tugas sembari menunggu usahanya maju namun tindakannya yang menyinggung perasaan saya seringkali membuat saya muak dan benar benar tak tahan dia tak pernah menghargai apa yang telah saya lakukan membanting tulang memenuhi kebutuhan ekonomi keluarga bagaimanapun saya juga seorang wanita yang ingin merawat diri saya sendiri ingin jalan jalan ke mall dengan santai walaupun tak berbelanja ataupun ingin bermanja manja dengannya namun setelah semua pekerjaan yang telah saya lakukan saya tak pernah mendapatkan hal yang saya dambakan itu saya benci tidak bisa menjadi diri saya sendiri setiap kali dia meminta maaf maka saya akan memaafkannya namun kata kata maaf itu seakan menjadi kata kunci untuk kesalahannya dia terus mengulanginya lagi sampai kapan saya tak tahu saya jenuh menunggu perubahan yang ia janjikan perubahan dirinya maupun perubahan kondisi finansial kami saya bosan dengan janji janjinya lebih baik kami berpisah saja
9190997 itulah satu hal yang memberatkan saya saya tidak ingin anak saya mengalami kejadian yang tak menyenangkan saya tak ingin anak anak saya memiliki orangtua yang bercerai tapi saya sudah tak kuat lagi
9190998 ya itulah saya ini bingung saya selama ini tidak melakukan hal hal yang aneh saya tidak main perempuan saya tidak berjudi saya tidak pernah keluar dengan teman teman saya bahkan merokok saja pun saya tidak suka sehari hari saya hanya mengurus anak anak dari mulai memandikan memberi makan mengantarnya sekolah menjemputnya mengajaknya main dan menemani belajar namun setelah itu semua saya lakukan yang saya dapatkan adalah sikap uring uringan dari istri tanpa sebab yang jelas saya pun tak ingin menjalani kondisi finansial seperti ini namun apa mau dikata semua usaha yang saya lakukan belum membuahkan hasil seperti yang kami harapkan
9190999 menurut bapak apakah tuduhan istri anda yang mengatakan bahwa ia sering tersinggung dengan sikap bapak itu benar
9191000 sejujurnya saya terkadang tak pernah merasa menyinggung perasaannya tapi jika meminta maaf bisa meredakan ha itu maka saya akan lakukan saya harus bagaimana lagi
9191001 saya sudah sabar bertahun tahun tanpa hasil sikapnya yang merasa tak bersalah inilah yang sering memicu saya untuk marah kondisi keuangan kami sudah memprihatinkan namun ia tak pernah melakukan usaha lebih keras demi kemajuan setelah mengantar anak sekolah ia pulang ke rumah dan tidur sampai siang
9191002 lalu saya harus melakukan apa semuanya kan tergantung pelanggan saya saya tak bisa memaksa mereka untuk melakukan pesanan jika mereka memang tak membutuhkannya kan

9191037 there are a lot of distractions that you can create in football even positive things are distractions its not just negative focusing on that is improperly placed thats not what we focus on we focus on the gameplan we focus on assignments we focus on being a great teammate we focus on doing everything we can within our power both mentally and physically to be prepared to play and do what the coaches ask expectations those types of things thats not relevant
9191038 footballs unique in the sense that after every play you come back together and get a new set of instructions they can be totally different than what you just did the play before so the play before really doesnt matter does it its really not relevant to the play in front of you expectations what you set whether theyre lower or higher or in between thats a distraction that has no impact or should have no impact on playing one play at a time its not relevant like fans in the stadium or the new scoreboard none of that matters
9191039 were going to attack the defense that were prepared for well make adjustments as we see the game unfold in front of us we always want to control the ball we always want to have time of possession and win the turnover battle those are keys every week at the end of the day its our job to score its our job to manage the game and score thats what the offense does and if we can do that and eat up the clock then we have the best of both worlds
9191040 the chemistry will continue to build and get better as the year goes on youre talking about a bunch of guys that are getting new coaches again and new systems on both sides of the ball but i think for the most part its pretty good i think we have guys who are coming together that are starting to understand in a deeper way what it means to care about a teammate and to be a team and take the focus off yourself and put it on the guys around you
9191041 im pretty positive so i have a positive outlook and positive expectations we talk about expectations and one of the things i do teach is you need to expect positive things when you break the huddle you should have positive expectations every single play it doesnt matter what happened the play before it doesnt matter if you turned the ball over the play before the next time you get it you should expect positive things i expect my quarterback to think that way my quarterback needs to think hes the best player on the football field thats the way he should think and because of that hell operate on a different level mentally if he thinks like that and really feels that way i think snead is better than he was but we need to see when the lights go on when people are yelling at him and when it really matters
9191042 jevans kind of wired a little bit like that he needs to temper that some look id rather have to dial a guy down than dial him up any day of the week its hard when its the other way at the same time with jevan theres not going to much hes going to see other than a few wrinkles that well adjust to that he probably hasnt seen in practice he just needs to manage the offense and play the way he knows how to play if he does that hell have lots of success
9191043 it really is a privilege and an honor to be here theres no question about that but ive got a job to do and i dont focus on those things i focus on making sure our offense is ready to play and our quarterbacks in particular are ready to play and we have a solid gameplan that gives us an opportunity to win thats all that matters
9191044 it wasnt out of choice or design thats for sure
9191045 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of to the club

9191047 before the internet we only had access to peoples eyes and ears via their living rooms that was enough for us to suck out their souls and we did that
9191048 then came the internet and social networks now the internet is like a needle that lets us get inside our consumers into their bloodstream now we can move around inside them and look for that soul less void we left and put up our billboards right there

9191050 the russian leadership jumps to the conclusion that mccain is sending them a signal choosing a conservative from russias neighbor and former territory across the bering strait before the sale of alaska to the united states in 1867 the russians believe this means mccain is willing to risk a new cold war to defend georgia ukraine and poland against russias resurgence

9191052 in the sub market were in i see stability and i feel we are on an upward swing
9191053 the market has corrected itself from the extremes of 2005 and 2006
9191054 prices are trending down back into a more realistic range where we probably would have been if we hadnt had the big peak in 2004 and 2005
9191055 if you look at whats happened in the overall real estate market since 1995 theres been a 270 percent price appreciation from 1995 to the peak of the market in 2006
9191056 even if you go from 2003 to the peak in 2006 we had a 100 percent price appreciation
9191057 the biggest challenge in the market today is for people who purchased in 2005 and 2006
9191058 these are the folks who really got hung out at the high end of the market and if they go to sell they dont have the equity in the home because we had a price decline into a more realistic price range that segment of the market is just going to have to correct itself which will happen over time some of those homes will be foreclosed others will continue to live in their homes and it will continue to increase in value
9191059 the market continues to improve month over month in 2008
9191060 since january we kind of had the lower point in the market where our total sales were 900 homes since then our monthly sales are increasing and now were upwards of 1 400 to 1 500 sales per month we keep seeing strong sales activity and were seeing more traffic were seeing the fence sitters coming back into the market
9191061 even when the market slows down peoples desire to purchase a new home doesnt go away theyre just postponing their decision because they dont have confidence in the market yet
9191062 we feel that the market will continue to improve and 2009 is when i really think well begin seeing strong movement of activity coming in i see it as being a steady increase

9191144 some of you from great distances to discuss the fate of the magical world and to examine the charges against mr j scott savage
9191145 you have been charged with conspiring with the dark circle to wreak havoc on farworld and on its sister world a non magical world called earth how do you plead
9191146 ive brought my wizard attorney whats your name again ah right richard bumblestump to represent me okay hes not really a wizard in fact he cant even do simple card tricks or the thing where you pretend your thumb is broken in two and hes not really an attorney either okay fine hes a homeless guy i picked up on the way to the trial but he does have a black jacket and white shirt if you wipe away some of the grime
9191147 we received testimony from one mr chet hawkins he said you wantonly and willfully wrote this book
9191148 this expos of the workings of the magical farworld and the connection it has with earth reveals too many secrets kept from non magical worlds how do you answer sir
9191149 well it looks like im representing myself here so i just want to say that while i did put the words down on the paper i was only recording events as i witnessed them i believe that gives me some sort of 5th amendment protection doesnt it
9191150 also and perhaps the worst crime of all i have a letter written by a mr bonesplitter he claimed you have continually and maliciously placed marcus kanenes into his hands and it is all part of your attempt to overthrow the magical world is this true sir
9191151 are you seriously going to believe a man who turns into a snake at the most inopportune times not to mention the fact that he has been known to go by at least one alias i think hes just embarrassed about the whole underwear incident and is trying to blame me
9191152 the magical infection the book will inflict on the non magical world
9191153 im not sure the non magicals especially people on earth can deal with the truth about magic
9191154 ahh here lies the crux of the matter you mr gorgon seem to be under the impression that there are such things as non magical folk i on the other hand posit that there are only people who have discovered their magic and those who have not i dont believe mr bumblestump for example has ever discovered his magic or if he did he has long since forgotten it isnt it our right no our duty to help everyone on earth and farworld find their magic i believe that is the only way to stop the threat posed by the dark circle and anyone that would seek to hold the rest of society down
9191155 mr savage i understand the book will be released for sale within a few weeks is that true
9191156 the thing we must do now is practice damage control do you plan to continue telling the story in other books mr savage
9191157 i know you are worried about scotts book you think it comes too close to revealing the whole truth about the magical world however i think its time for that revelation other authors from earth have been revealing bits and pieces of the truth for years i would call your attention to the work of j k rowling she brought our world into the limelight and the people of earth are embracing it
9191158 i say we praise those authors including j scott savage i believe its time our two worlds combine against the threat of all dark forces everywhere we can co exist
9191159 it flies in the face of thousands of years of conventional wisdom but perhaps it is time we work together personally i get tired of practicing the damage control cedrick suggested
9191160 do you have anything you wish to say in closing mr savage
9191161 thank you and now i must go in search of mr bumblestump i think he may have locked himself in the janitors closet i hate to think of what he might have done in the mop bucket
9191162 thank you mr savage you have given me hope perhaps someday i will discover my magic as you say i can i also wish to apologize for saying you have no magical power obviously i was wrong you most assuredly have the magical powers to make a well written well told story

9191216 i may look like your garden variety pta president but as soon as the puck drops im not out there to be your friend ill rip your heart out
9191217 while i wouldnt exactly call the governor a goon in the classic dave schultz ty domi sense i mean she does have nominal skills but shes not afraid to go into the corners and fight for the puck and if the refs looking the other way you better hope youre wearing protection im looking forward to the vp debate as many will be surprised what she lacks in foreign policy experience legislative experience gravitas and name recognition she more than makes up with poise grit and character contestant the governor uniquely combines the old testament toughness of a hockey mom which really plays to the evangelicals with the never say die qualities of a beauty pageant

9191228 satire is part of what we do and it is meant to bring things out into the open to hold up a mirror to the absurd
9191229 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
9191230 artist barry blitt satirizes the use of scare tactics and misinformation in the presidential election to derail barack obamas campaign
9191231 i think the idea that the obamas are branded as unpatriotic let alone as terrorists in certain sectors is preposterous it seemed to me that depicting the concept would show it as the fear mongering ridiculousness that it is
9191232 our cover the politics of fear combines a number of fantastical images about the obamas and shows them for the obvious distortions they are the burning flag the nationalist radical and islamic outfits the fist bump the portrait on the wall all of them echo one attack or another satire is part of what we do and it is meant to bring things out into the open to hold up a mirror to the absurd and thats the spirit of this cover the reader of the same issue will also see that there are two very serious articles on barack obama inside hendrick hertzbergs comment the flip flop flap and ryan lizzas 15 000 word reporting piece on the candidates political education and rise in chicago
9191233 at a press availability sunday afternoon in san diego obama was asked according to a transcript by
9191234 have you seen it if not i can show it to you on my computer it shows your wife michelle with an afro and an ak 47 and the two of you doing the fist bump with you in a sort of turban type thing on top i wondered if youve seen it or if you want to see it or if you have a response to it
9191235 obama shrugging incredulously replied i have no response to that
9191236 the new yorker may think as one of their staff explained to us that their cover is a satirical lampoon of the caricature senator obamas right wing critics have tried to create but most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
9191237 remember a few years ago when the new yorker had a cover at a time of great black jewish tension in new york you had a cartoon of an obvious orthodox jewish male kissing a black woman and this created a lot of buzz
9191238 knowing the liberal politics of the magazine i believe the magazines staff when they say the illustration is meant ironically as a parody of the caricature some conservatives and some supporters of sen hillary clinton d n y are painting of the obamas
9191239 but its still fairly incendiary at least as these things go i wonder what the reaction would be were it the weekly standard or the national review putting such an illustration on their covers
9191240 intent factors into these matters of course but no upper east side liberal no matter how superior they feel their intellect is should assume that just because theyre mocking such ridiculousness the illustration wont feed into the same beast in emails and other media its a recruitment poster for the right wing
9191241 uh huh whats that they say about repeating a rumor
9191242 presumably the new yorker readership is sophisticated enough to get the joke but still this is going to upset a lot of people probably for the same reason its going to delight a lot of other people namely those on the right because its got all the scare tactics and misinformation that has so far been used to derail barack obamas campaign all in one handy illustration anyone whos tried to paint obama as a muslim anyone whos tried to portray michelle as angry or a secret revolutionary out to get whitey anyone who has questioned their patriotism well heres your image
9191243 hertzberg in comment p 27 writes about the misbegotten notion that obama is flip flopping on major issues and in
9191244 on the edition of the syndicated program the mclaughlin group that aired the weekend of july 11 13 while discussing recent comments made by the rev jesse jackson about sen barack obama host john mclaughlin said question does it frost jackson jesse jackson that someone like obama who fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside that an oreo should be the beneficiary of the long civil rights struggle which jesse jackson spent his lifetime fighting for

9191246 barack obamas groundbreaking candidacy has raised high expectations among blacks and whites that his election would make race relations in the united states better
9191247 a usa today gallup poll of nearly 2 000 americans also finds about a third of both groups say the defeat of the first black to win a major partys presidential nomination would worsen race relations
9191248 the survey underscores the unusual stakes in this election even though neither democrat obama nor republican john mccain has sought to cast their contest as a matter of racial politics but rather one of different prescriptions for the nation
9191249 obama is slightly ahead of mccain in gallups daily nationwide tracking poll 46 43
9191250 in 2004 the john kerry campaign made a july announcement that it would make a 2 million buy in african american media the buy said african american media experts was never completed bet got some money but not much went elsewhere they said this time around theyre hoping for better from sen barack obama
9191251 mr obama might want to move beyond race but african american media outlets are hoping he remembers his roots not only would it benefit their particular media sector it could also have an impact on congressional and local races
9191252 so far the campaign has done relatively little spending in urban radio black aimed cable tv or african american newspapers
9191253 after a 21 month tenure that included the departure of two times editors and plans for the sharpest staff and production cuts in the newspapers history amid a continuing slide in advertising revenue
9191254 hiller was the third times publisher named since the newspaper was acquired in 2000 by chicago based tribune
9191255 last month i wrote to say how much i valued your intelligence professionalism and creativity and that i knew of no smarter or more inventive newsroom yet even in that i did not take your full measure in recent weeks faced with the call to reinvent your paper while reducing your ranks you have shown new levels of commitment to your work and our readers and i could not be more grateful or awed
9191256 for that reason and so many others it is especially hard to tell you today that i have decided to resign
9191257 i have expressed a desire to consider something new and i am grateful for the deep respect they showed me throughout those discussions at the same time there is much to do and your new owners should have their own editor compatible with their style and goals so today bob will name my successor he inherits a treasure in this newspaper and this staff and i will count on you to continue to work hard on our readers behalf just as you have done in the years we have been together
9191258 kern who joined the chicago tribune in 1991 as suburban editor after serving as executive editor and managing editor of the daily herald in arlington heights ill later served as the tribunes associate managing editor metro deputy managing editor features and associate editor
9191259 later as editorial director for tribune publishing kern was responsible for coordinating editorial cooperation and coverage among the companys daily newspapers
9191260 earlier this year kern was installed as named vice president news and features for tribune media services
9191261 i took the buyout frankly because the herald refused to give me any reason for optimism that i might one day return to commentary
9191262 the final straw was when my old job of metro columnist which i did for 12 years came open when the current metro columnist ana menendez accepted a fellowship to teach in egypt i applied for the job but the internal posting said that the optimal candidate would speak english and spanish so i didnt even qualify for a job i held for 12 years
9191263 when i tried to ask about the prospects that i might ever return to commentary i was essentially told that the paper was going in another direction thats about as specific as it got
9191264 when i returned from sabbatical i was made a neighbors community editor i did that for six months then was moved to the city desk where i served for nine months as education and environment editor but i longed to write made that clear and got no encouraging responses
9191265 at the moment i have no plans ill be spending the next couple of months working that out and hopefully it wont take too much longer than that i have a total of 17 years experience writing columns as a metro editorial and free lance during my sabbatical columnist it was experience the herald didnt want and ive never received an official reason why not
9191266 robert hadnt been a fulltime columnist at the herald for several years before his sabbatical his departure from the regular column lineup was something he worked out with editors at that time roberts assignments before he went on sabbatical included a stint as higher ed reporter and just prior to leaving general assignment there were no plans for robert to resume column writing upon his return
9191267 instead my exit coincides with a far more serious story as i write this respected colleagues are losing their jobs the paper is offering workshops with names like marketing yourself with a r sum its impossible now to say goodbye with a smile
9191268 i can write a book about all the ways this paper has disappointed me
9191269 as their contract negotiations intensified this week the newsroom employees at san franciscos leading spanish language news station kdtv channel 14 should have been in a strong bargaining position not only is the newsroom full of coveted bilingual journalists but for the past two ratings periods kdtv has beaten most of its bay area english language competitors in various ratings contests
9191270 but when it comes to spanish language television news high ratings dont translate into high salaries
9191271 so while the spanish language news audience may be growing many advertisers dont perceive hispanics to be the right audience
9191272 the last broadcast of this new york based program which many listeners tuned into at npr org rather than over the air is expected to be on july 25 its an expensive failure the first year budget was more than 2 million and comes at a time when npr is facing the same financial constraints as other news media thanks to higher costs and a downturn in underwriting
9191273 during my time at the sun i was the city editor the only black person to hold that job and my other jobs included national reporter rewrite assistant city editor and education editor for about six years i edited the perspective the news and commentary section that appeared on sundays before i joined the evening sun in 1983 i was the chief political reporter for the wilmington del news journal im a 1978 graduate of the summer program for minority journalists at berkeley
9191274 this is a choice i made because of how the editorial staff at theroot handled my response
9191275 this is also in the context of his earlier calling me baby mama during an on line disagreement about child support and his repeatedly calling my cell phone after my surgery
9191276 apparently my editors saw the situation differently three weeks ago i wrote on my blog that jimis work was unrelenting misogyny
9191277 my editors did not see the distinction between my discussion of jimis work and jimis personal attack on me i believe they are quite different perhaps from an editorial perspective these things are not different
9191278 so i took a deep breath and realized that i had to respect the editors decision to see this situation differently
9191279 i am not a journalist i dont have to write in a space that feels hostile especially when it pays so little so i made a choice to leave i am not angry with theroot com or the way that my editor handled the situation i am sad and disappointed of course but i also feel very clear that this was the right decision for me

9191293 at the end of the day when you talk about connoisseurship it comes down to whether something is beautiful enough to be a leonardo whether it resonates with all of the qualities that define his handwriting sublime modeling exquisite delicacy an unparalleled understanding of anatomy and to me this drawing has none of those things
9191294 even though i honestly do not know what this drawing is i still believe that it is not a leonardo
9191295 if you have players like sachin and sehwag it really helps in doing and achieving these things consistently but it their absence is not really in control because at times you will have injuries
9191296 we didnt have ishant sharma we didnt have sachin and veeru sehwag who was in prime form but it is up to other individuals to take up the responsibility because there is no point in sitting and sulking about guys who are not there
9191297 they are the guys who are part of the 16 who can really make a difference and they were doing just that
9191298 but of course you miss individuals specially the great players
9191299 in the middle it is very important to rotate strike and we have been able to do that we have got the partnership we have played the spinners well we negotiated muttiah murali tharan well i think we played him really well it has been tough over the yearsto play murali in sri lanka i think we tackled ajantha mendis quite well too
9191300 overall i was quite impressed by the way we performed from the 20th till the40th over of course in some games we lost wickets and you are really not in a position to do anything but that is part and parcel of the game
9191301 i really enjoyed the break and the main thing is i was enjoying the practice session more and it sets a good trend
9191302 you have to give 100 per cent there as well you just can not bat for 20 minutes and go under the shade when you feel from inside to go under the shade that is the time when you realise your body needs a bit of rest
9191303 i was happy to get some rest thanks to the selectors and the bcci when i came back here i really enjoyed the couple of sessions that i had in bangalore they were tough it was skill related and i really enjoyed the sessions i was doing the keeping and batting and also enjoyed fielding

9191378 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9191379 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9191380 but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9191381 the banks are in the same position and could easily do the same but while they were very quick to hike their rates independently to the rba when funding costs were increasing earlier this year they are now just stalling waiting until an announcement by the rba
9191382 they have talked for months about how they must concentrate on their own cost of funds not the cash rate now is the time for them to back up their rhetoric with action
9191383 they are boosting their bottom line instead of passing those savings to onto their customers
9191384 we are the last non bank lender standing and the banks cannot just keep widening their profit margins and charging what they like while wizard is on the scene offering honest good value mortgages
9191385 if the banks dont compete with us customers will switch away from the banks because the savings could be huge
9191386 there is evidence that the australian banking sector may be more profitable than those of other jurisdictions

9191388 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9191389 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9191390 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9191391 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9191392 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9191393 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9191394 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9191395 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect

9191821 excelente como ustedes saben entre los compromisos del acuerdo ese que firm jelipe en palacio nacional est el de recuperar las plazas publicas con ese compromiso y la evidencia de una protesta masiva contra la insegurida jelipe est dispuesto a implantar la ley marcial y el toque de queda ansina fue la orden que le trajo el representante de bush que vino a hablar con yoni camote y el gabinete de segurida se aproxima la batalla por el petr leo y no es posible permitir que la gente del chamuco de macuspana siga en posesi n de las calles de la capital

9191836 if the tatas are allowed to enter the retail sector it will spell disaster for small traders which trinamool congress will resist through movements
9191837 the marxists speak against imperialists but are in effect backing capitalists interests just like they are now doing in case of the tatas
9191838 we dont want a blockade and are not fools to obstruct our own people from joining our dharna programme we have not obstructed anybody

9191845 i have withdrawn my papers in line with the partys decision that asif ali zardari will contest as the presidential candidate
9191846 but now all of a sudden now that siddiqui has been put up as a candidate they are launching a character assassination campaign against him which i think is very undemocratic
9191847 why not bring this subject up with a lawyer and sue mcaffee for defamation and so forth

9191849 mcafeess siteadvisor is also being sued by 7search a site once considered to be a big distributor of forced active x drive by downloads over being tagged as spyware tongue in cheek
9191850 jon this may be a case of slander of title
9191851 feedback from credible users suggests that downloads on this site may contain what some people would consider adware spyware or other potentially unwanted programs
9191852 click the link and next to a big red danger button with a big x in the middle you read when we tested this site we found links to antispyware com which our analysis found to be suspicious
9191853 suspicious what precisely does that mean suspicious of what suspicious in what respect
9191854 antispyware com has been a supporter of p2pnet for a long time and to the best of my knowledge theres nothing even vaguely suspicious about it
9191855 so i was looking into this and i can tell you whats going on with antispyware com being suspicious

9191862 avremo una striscia quotidiana con serena dandini poi la nuova soap agrodolce avremo poi cinque puntate con paola cortellesi ognuna sar incentrata su un grande tema per esempio lamore e su questo paola proporr le sue imitazioni i duetti con gli ospiti e via dicendo
9191863 that the universe was a vast wheeling unknowable thing and that all theories about it including his own were not descriptions but merely approaches
9191864 si fa non si fa si fa non si fa
9191865 if it seems too good to be true it is more than likely
9191866 the guys are running around good their energy level is good
9191867 i think physically theyre ready and mentally theyre ready were tired of talking about it we want to play
9191868 everyones saying we have to win if we dont win were going kill you
9191869 im not buying into it just yet i need one hit and then ill buy into it real quick
9191870 i want to go out there and have no mental errors go out there and make every block make every catch and hopefully also make some big plays that can help us win too
9191871 us seniors want to go off with a bang as a team we want to start the season off right
9191872 were ready to go against some new blood other than ourselves
9191873 the state of colorado definitely gets excited for this game
9191874 its always great to play in an nfl stadium thats that gorgeous with such a great field and its always a great thing to play in a place that a lot of the guys on the field dream to be in one day
9191875 we want to encourage students to talk to us voluntary participation is a large part of the success
9191876 in the past it was made mandatory and kids resented it lesson learned
9191877 they made it seem like it would interfere with registration if i did not take the course
9191878 in the end it was frustrating and made me want to drink more
9191879 i read the letter carefully about the course and didnt take it because i found i didnt have to but read that it affected consequences if a student was in trouble
9191880 somehow we need to curb this cultures alcohol use within college and society as a whole they need to know how to handle issues going on
9191881 whether or not a student drinks alcoholedu will provide personalized information motivating them to make healthy behavior decisions and how to better handle peers drinking behavior
9191882 what were trying to do now is use the convention as a way to recruit new volunteers
9191883 any time spent in denver would be wasted when we could be on campus doing volunteer recruitment and registering new voters
9191884 students for peace and justice is one of the primary organizations planning demonstrations with the alliance for real democracy
9191885 we might as well get together in some sort of communal space to watch the speech

9191888 many of you know my father as a distinguished and accomplished senator
9191889 i know him as an incredible father and a loving grandfather
9191890 the only one who leaves me breathless and speechless at the same time
9191891 let me say this as simply as i can yes yes i accept your nomination to run and serve alongside our next president of the united states barack obama
9191892 to live our faith and treasure our family we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
9191893 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the future john mccain will give us
9191894 we have the power to change it thats barack obama and what he will do for this country hell change it
9191895 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
9191896 on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
9191897 the american people are ready im ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
9191898 i thought he was strong he connects with people and has a compelling story himself
9191899 he articulated well how barack obama will bring change and how mccain offers another four years of the same
9191900 get good use out of him over the coming seasons

9191904 la discriminaci n y la intolerancia hacia los cristianos debe afrontarse con la misma determinaci n con la que se combaten el antisemitismo y la islamofobia
9191905 no se cansa de subrayar que el fundamento del derecho a la libertad religiosa se encuentra en la misma dignidad de todas las personas humanas
9191906 los cristianos son v ctimas de prejuicios estereotipos e intolerancias a veces de tipo cultural
9191907 frente a esta situaci n se comprende que la eficacia de la acci n internacional dependa en buena medida de su credibilidad y por tanto tambi n de su car cter inclusivo
9191908 en otras palabras a adi ser a una paradoja omitir la adopci n de medidas concretas para garantizar que los cristianos gocen de libertad o bien crear una especie de jerarqu a de las intolerancias precisamente cuando se trata de eliminar la discriminaci n y la intolerancia
9191909 por otro lado precis tambi n ser a un error que las comunidades religiosas instrumentalizaran cualquier medida legal o administrativa hacia ellos tachando de discriminaci n cualquier procedimiento leg timo derivado de sus actividades
9191910 absolutizar la tolerancia es en cambio retirarse frente a esta dignidad absolutizar la tolerancia significa de hecho transformarla en valor supremo pero esto inevitablemente pone a la verdad en segundo plano y la relativiza
9191911 la renuncia a la verdad a su vez abandona al hombre en manos del m s fuerte de lo til o lo inmediato privando a la persona de su grandeza
9191912 la santa sede ha conseguido que en el mbito del llamado programa sobre tolerancia de la osce no se trate exclusivamente de los graves fen menos del antisemitismo y la discriminaci n contra los musulmanes sino tambi n de los igualmente inaceptables episodios de intolerancia contra los cristianos
9191913 para que quienes a causa de las guerras o de los reg menes totalitarios se ven obligados a abandonar la propia casa y la propia patria sean apoyados por los cristianos en la defensa y tutela de sus derechos
9191914 para que todas las familias cristianas fieles al sacramento del matrimonio cultiven los valores del amor y de la comunidad de modo que sean una peque a comunidad evangelizadora abierta y sensible a las necesidades materiales y espirituales de los hermanos
9191915 los j venes gitanos su lugar en la iglesia y en el mundo

9191919 las atrocidades cometidas contra la comunidad cristiana y otras personas inocentes
9191920 por la promoci n de la paz y la com n armon a en la india
9191921 las muertes y las atrocidades contra los cristianos son por los malvados designios de los fan ticos fundamentalistas stos siguen sus actos violentos y el gobierno de la naci n no ha sido capaz de proteger a los cristianos y otras personas inocentes
9191922 el prop sito de los fundamentalistas es expulsar a los cristianos de la regi n lo que resulta evidente de los esl ganes que repiten contra ellos sabemos que la mayor parte de los sacerdotes pastores religiosos y religiosas de kandhamal se han refugiado en la selva para salvar sus vidas y que los fundamentalistas est n busc ndolos
9191923 mayor desastre en la historia de la comunidad cristiana en la india y m s a n en orissa
9191924 la polic a hasta ahora no ha sido capaz de controlar la situaci n
9191925 los cristianos de orissa viven en continua tensi n y gran miedo la ley y las fuerzas del orden no les amparan y est n viviendo en condiciones pat ticas desde hace cuatro d as deben reconstruirse las iglesias casa y lugares de culto y la sensaci n de seguridad debe restaurarse en los corazones de los cristianos
9191926 la vida humana es un don un regalo y un derecho que siempre se debe valorar cuidar y proteger
9191927 esta toma de conciencia evidentemente comienza respetando y defendiendo la vida desde su concepci n hasta su muerte natural en el marco de esta reflexi n hacemos un llamado a la sociedad en su conjunto para luchar por proteger a todo embri n humano porque el derecho inalienable a la vida de todo individuo desde su concepci n debe ser un elemento constitutivo de la sociedad civil y de su legislaci n
9191928 el derecho a la vida aparece de manera clara y concreta en los art culos 1 14 y 22 de la constituci n pol tica de los estados unidos mexicanos de donde se desprende el principio de igualdad de todos los individuos que se encuentren en territorio nacional por el que se les otorga el goce de los derechos que la propia constituci n consagra prohibiendo la esclavitud y todo tipo de discriminaci n y por tanto que nadie podr ser privado entre otros derechos de la vida
9191929 que tiene la sociedad y los legisladores para que la constituci n de nuestro pa s reconozca expl citamente los derechos del reci n concebido que es un elemento fundamental para la consolidaci n de la cultura de la vida
9191930 por lo anterior afirmaron los prelados mexicanos consideramos que nunca ser moralmente aceptable la erecci n de un derecho sobre otro m s a n si se trata del principio de vida humana que se origina desde el momento mismo de la concepci n
9191931 tiene sed de un estado de derecho que proteja a todos los ciudadanos y anhela una cultura de la vida que haga de nuestro pa s un lugar de convivencia civil y positiva por ello preocup monos de que nadie jam s resulte excluido del desarrollo humano
9191932 la iglesia fiel a su misi n ve en estos signos una extraordinaria ocasi n para asumir su compromiso social en la formaci n de una conciencia cristiana que contribuya en la construcci n del bien com n
9191933 trabajemos y colaboremos todos juntos por garantizar el derecho a la vida de todas las personas sin el cual no cabe la existencia ni disfrute de todos los dem s derechos de los cuales depende el futuro de nuestro m xico
9191934 actividades tan variopintas como construcci n de pozos y letrinas distribuci n de utensilios y semillas para el cultivo formaci n para que los campesinos conozcan t cnicas de cultivos m s rentables reforestaci n vacunaci n del ganado y ayudar a escuelas donde en cada aula hay una media de 134 ni os
9191935 en este momento esta crisis est algo m s relegada al olvido por parte de la comunidad internacional que actualmente dirige su atenci n a otros lugares esto hace que la ayuda humanitaria est disminuyendo
9191936 cuando las crisis desaparecen de las portadas de los peri dicos o de las pantallas de televisi n organizaciones como c ritas siguen trabajando a largo plazo para rehabilitar a las v ctimas adem s de repartir v veres y reconstruir casas hay que ayudar a la gente a superar los traumas profundos causados por la violencia
9191937 las peregrinaciones itinerarios hist ricos itinerarios de fe e itinerarios geogr ficos
9191938 casi al lado precisa de una de las m s grandes mezquitas del pa s tanto que puedo casi tocarla desde mi despacho
9191939 all la gente es muy muy p a con un compromiso profundo y una fe que verdaderamente me sorprende de vez en cuando
9191940 las nicas persecuciones explica monse or hinder est n constituidas por estos impedimentos que hacen dif cil el trabajo pastoral
9191941 pero si por una parte no es f cil profesar abiertamente la propia fe observa porque jesucristo es para m el hijo de dios vivo yo debo anunciarlo aunque esto pueda sonar como un insulto seg n el cor n
9191942 la tendencia a la arrogancia que tenemos en nuestra cultura no s lo respecto al islam
9191943 tenemos la tendencia a considerarnos la cima del desarrollo de la humanidad pero esto no es justo
9191944 no todos los pueblos est n obligados a tener la misma historia
9191945 hay tambi n otros modos de vivir la dicotom a entre el mundo tecnol gico moderno y el pasado de la propia historia y la religi n
9191946 tambi n yo estoy convencido de que el mundo musulm n debe abrirse m s a la raz n seg n un proceso que hemos atravesado tambi n nosotros pero no quiere decir que esto deba conducirles al mismo secularismo quiz somos nosotros los equivocados
9191947 insistir en la reciprocidad en sentido matem tico no funciona
9191948 sobre todo el concepto de democracia seg n la mentalidad occidental es el resultado de un largo proceso que tambi n a la iglesia le ha costado aceptar observa no se pueden imponer democracia y derechos como los conocemos nosotros porque son fruto de un itinerario que no es por fuerza el que deben hacer tambi n los emiratos rabes
9191949 para los musulmanes la fe es parte integrante de la vida
9191950 si alguien quiere venir en pos de m ni guese a s mismo coja su cruz y me siga
9191951 ya no soy yo quien vive sino que cristo vive en m
9191952 el que quiera salvar la propia vida la perder pero el que pierda la vida por mi causa la encontrara
9191953 en su nacimiento cristo fue definido por el anciano sime n como la luz que ilumina a las naciones
9191954 quien me sigue no camina ya en las tinieblas sino que tendr la luz de la vida
9191955 los cristianos en la vigilia pascual cuando reinan todav a las tinieblas de la muerte en cruz iluminan el cirio pascual signo de la luz triunfante que surge de la vida del cristo resucitado en esta noche muy santa en la que la muerte es vencida
9191956 este es el primer sentido de las procesiones de antorchas o de los caminos de luz que iluminan la noche de los hombres
9191957 no habr ya noche no necesitar n luz de l mpara ni del sol para iluminarse pues el se or dios extender sobre ellos su luz y reinar n por los siglos de los siglos
9191958 esta ley nunca podr hacer moral lo que es abominable
9191959 quien recibe a uno de estos peque os en mi nombre a m me recibe
9191960 cosa ci fai in mezza a tutta questa gente sei tu che vuoi o in fin dei conti non ti frega niente
9191961 young prince dont you think its time in the story to go out into the wilderness and gain some experience to get ready to become king of the mafusa the most awful united states of america to be ready you should get out there look at cloud pictures talk to warthogs meerkats and baboons and grow up some
9191962 but you said in 2004 you wouldnt have enough experience by now in 2008
9191963 well do what you want but that gang of hyenas youve been hanging out with fleger rezko ayers cant be a good thing a real king is supposed to be fighting the bad guys in this story and the evil schemes of that really old lion
9191964 that was invesco field and maybe you shouldnt have quite so much pride before you are really in charge of the pride
9191965 well actually the old lion chose a lioness to run with today and everybodys been roaring about that it seems like your speech is now palin in comparison
9191966 all right go out there and say that lioness from a bitter small town hasnt been out to look at cloud pictures she hasnt met flatulent warthogs or befriended mere cats or doggies for that matter she hasnt grown up enough or gone out to the wilderness to gain some experience
9191967 well i hate to point it out but you havent either and she has been out to the wilderness and she actually did corner and cage a few corrupt hyena politicians and beat some of them in contests she met no flatulent hogs but she got a big natural gas line running unlike you prince she was in charge of a savannah between russia and canada and in charge of the lion guard and
9191968 all right all right i dont care get out there and give my dissing message
9191969 thats all right ill go out there blame it on you and say a bunch of nice stuff about the lioness
9191970 thats right under the bus cmon lets go under the bus
9191971 yeah i guess youre right but i will be very soon
9191972 youre not going to sing are you im beginning to think that old lions the good guy
9191973 oh zatu youre still under there zatu i forgot all about you yes im going to sing all right just like the king of pop
9191974 oh youre still there maybe not but i will be soon
9191975 problem is palin directed none of these people to intercede her her behalf either personally or 9 46 am
9191976 so sad that all the major news networks except fox are in a feeding frenzy over the
9191977 came to vegas for a weekend and cheated on him
9191978 dropping two points doesnt necessarily mean brown has become a worse school
9191979 two places is a micro movement when dealing with 260 schools
9191980 the state associations will be allowed to include four guest players in their squad
9191981 one of these four players could be a cricketer from overseas who has played at least ten tests and or twenty one day internationals
9191982 in my opinion we are the greatest sporting team in the world and we have standards
9191983 they may be higher than other teams but if you dont fulfil those standards unfortunately youre not going to be a part of our squad
9191984 the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team
9191985 our bowlers bowled well and we fielded well also but we didnt bat well
9191986 once we lost five wickets quickly it was very difficult to come back
9191987 it was hard at the start there was a little bit of swing
9191988 marsh batted fantastic and mr cricket mike hussey was at his best again today
9191989 we put most of our effort behind rhode island candidates i think people spend too much time on presidential elections rather than local and state ones
9191990 but we will go to manchester new hampshire for a weekend trip sometime in october to do some campaigning
9191991 certainly some value in working for a campaign but its not the most bang for your buck
9191992 i would say we were all moved in but that would be a lie
9191993 at first i thought maybe rhode island was a territory
9191994 in the four conventions ive been to weve never had great seats
9191995 you can notice the bigger or uncertain states have seats closer to the front and center
9191996 i think were all going to leave denver ready to rally together as a party in providence
9191997 i was moved to tears by mpcs stories of their experiences
9191998 its easier to open up be personal be trusting with a fellow student
9191999 the interesting opportunity with the uel is that youre actually preserving three buildings in one
9192000 oooh oui oui madame pleeez do not use zee riding crop on my poor backside
9192001 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
9192002 i went to brown so that i wouldnt ever have to take english again brown lets you take whatever you want
9192003 where you are free to avoid subjects you fear and where nothing will force you outside your comfort zone

9192005 i am the king of the castle i have trained gail well and either i was a wonderful teacher or she was a quick study my life is perfect i get most of the bed when i feel like it
9192006 we finally have jack completely trained if we want him to toss us some food all we have to do is jump through this hoop
9192007 yes excellent film however scared the shit out of me as a kid so much so that i blocked it out of my memory

9192011 no se ha negado a viajar he tomado la decisi n yo creo que es mejor que se quede esperar a que se resuelva el tema definitivamente a partir de la semana que viene cuando regrese de su selecci n sabremos c mo tratarlo y cambiar a todo
9192012 para nosotros sigue siendo el mismo jugador importante pero tenemos que mirar las condiciones en las que llega el jugador se ha visto que en ltimas semanas la presi n de su entorno fue m s fuerte hubo declaraciones y el jugador no est en condiciones
9192013 en la ida en valencia nos dimos cuenta de que no pod amos ir a m s porque l est preocupado con presi n y la cabeza fuera nosotros quer amos ganar la supercopa era mejor no meterle y utilizar jugadores comprometidos con nosotros por eso fue el cambio y ahora no le llevamos hasta que no se resuelva el tema no podemos utilizarle
9192014 s lo que es mejor para l como el padre a un ni o sabemos lo que es mejor para el ni o pero l no lo piensa a la larga se va a dar cuenta de que tenemos raz n
9192015 pero estoy encantado de hacer el trabajo sucio de recuperarle an micamente en ese caso tengo confianza de lo que somos capaces con la ayuda del grupo porque los jugadores tambi n le van a apoyar y va a estar como siempre lo vamos a conseguir estoy seguro
9192016 es una decisi n m a no del club nunca el club ha dado una opini n me ha dejado la decisi n para m en las dos ltimas semanas son decisiones m as llevarle o no

9192043 prendere le cose sul serio non sempre significa avvicinarsi alla verit
9192044 we make three or four trips a year to have the weapons destroyed and the last time they weighed 800kg
9192045 it is unusual to find fully operational automatic machine guns we dont do it everyday but unfortunately they do crop up
9192046 as a 45 year old single girl in newcastle i realised that there were no dating events for discerning professionals in my age group and found the online dating system too flat and impersonal for me i didnt want to wait for friends to fix me up or waste time talking to strangers in loud clubs
9192047 with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible
9192048 a remarkable book raffis is a powerful and dramatic story and i am privileged to have been part of it
9192049 we are placed in a specific context to count in ways no one else does that is our destiny
9192050 the response he got from the legislators was dont come to us and ask for more money when you cannot fill the 56 or 58 trooper positions that were vacant
9192051 so he was making a pitch for additional funding when he couldnt even fill what he currently had available to him
9192052 i made an inquiry and was told by commissioner monegan that there was a process in place and that it was handled and it was over and i reported back to the first gentleman that there was nothing more that could be done
9192053 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9192054 i want to reassure the public that i will continue to carry on in my job i will not surrender i will not quit
9192055 pad members have agreed not to give up since they samaks party took power in the election they are trying to manipulate politics and interfere in the justice system
9192056 there was no allowances for any wind generated towers in our zoning bylaw so we have to add it to the bylaw and have public hearings on it to see what the local reaction would be
9192057 the reaction from most of the people in that area is good
9192058 anyone who is involved can potentially get income from it so most that ive heard from are in favour of it
9192059 wind is a renewable energy so it helps meet our kyoto targets that weve legislated
9192060 it also compliments our hydro electric generation so during periods of drought years well have wind that we can rely on
9192061 we have one of the best wind resources in north america and as a result we can produce wind energy competitively
9192062 its flat prairie and that type of terrain and topography really does lend itself to wind farming development
9192063 construction costs are typically lower than if it was on a hilly or mountainous terrain
9192064 the zoning bylaw amendment would put in the specific provisions for a wind farm such as separation distances
9192065 we wont start that until we get further down the road with the development plan amendment
9192066 these things can take a little longer than expected so i wouldnt want to put a timeline on it
9192067 the signs are sturdy so they havent blown away theyve been stolen usually in the dead of night we must be getting under the skins of the people who support wind farms
9192068 these of course are the people who dont mind seeing their countryside turned into a light industrial estate perhaps theyre looking forward to the noise and light flicker they want the value of their homes to plummet
9192069 we were delighted though not surprised by the tremendous turnout from fellow villagers who are horrified by what is proposed on the fields near the village
9192070 we have already stated that our fight is not against wind energy in general though we think the argument for wind power is seriously flawed but that sites in central england prove to be the most inefficient locations for wind turbines
9192071 the very fact that your energy is proposing to build 125 metre tall turbines shows that there isnt sufficient wind here in yelvertoft to power the 100 metre turbines usually used on wind farms thus the need to erect taller ones
9192072 that is a drop in the ocean for them but it is the only reason this is going into gravir
9192073 it is the cheapest option the rest is just flannel and the community is not happy with it
9192074 calls to locate the cable and sub station on eishken were dismissed as were calls to upgrade the existing skye to harris interconnector instead
9192075 it was confirmed that compulsory wayleave powers through gardens and crofts would be used if necessary to route the cable from the loch to the sub station
9192076 it appears that the only element of the proposals that needs any sort of approval at all is the detailed design of the sub station building
9192077 about 75 workers at the peak of construction with six to eight permanent jobs the project will produce about 300 000 annually for brookings county
9192078 we expect to be filing permits in the next couple of months for a significant expansion it would be south dakotas largest project
9192079 we havent announced how many megawatts well save that for another day
9192080 we have not had 60 votes in the senate i am hopeful in september we will be able to break through that logjam and find 60 votes in the senate
9192081 are vital and we need to do everything we can to move forward with them
9192082 the federal government should not forget it starts from the private sector and needs to return there
9192083 we have been waiting a long time for the wind companies to find out the wind didnt stop at the minnesota south dakota border
9192084 what makes this such a powerful icon is that its unbelievably simple and telegraphic
9192085 i think there is something about the spiral design that makes it visually arresting
9192086 may actually see the sound of these blades as reassuring but to others its a visual and sonic intrusion
9192087 a story that validates our feelings and amplifies the way we look at the world
9192088 it didnt have anything to do with how good the car was
9192089 rockets of course were the icon of the day so capturing that rocketness in a car transferred some of the magic
9192090 demand is our right its our right to be wasteful and profligate the supply is never ending and will take care of itself so an icon that represents a risk free way to increase supply resonates with us
9192091 but theres resistance because that is something you have to do right now
9192092 theres a huge danger if we try to build public policy about risk free iconography and storytelling
9192093 we end up with nuclear waste dumps and ethanol there really is no free lunch but thats a difficult story to tell
9192094 transcended its literal functionality to become an iconic symbol of the ideal
9192095 almost branded icons of hopeful we can beat them better mousetraps
9192096 right now it stands for dont confuse me with the facts
9192097 the steps needed to be in full compliance they accepted the responsibility for the oversights and worked with us cooperatively in outlining this agreement
9192098 we took a very long abandoned and polluted industrial site and decided to purchase it clean it up and restore it and basically return it to the tax rolls to benefit the local economy
9192099 we referred to it as our effort to de rust the rust belt
9192100 pose any health issue for employees neighboring businesses or area residents
9192101 it took us some time to figure out what the voc measurements were for the industrial process we do then to understand what the best technology is to rectify it
9192102 it would have been wonderful if we had understood this perfectly
9192103 needed a much more intensive computer system that was focused on record keeping helping us catalog all our required data keeping track of all site renovations and also training and we have put that in place
9192104 glad dep keeps such a tight lookout it helps make sure were compliant everything we do has to be in 100 percent compliance with the highest possible environmental standards this makes gamesa better in the long run
9192105 someone should keep a lessons learned list so we can apply this on an industry wide basis we hope to continue to make this site in every way shape and form gold stars warts and all a national example of how to do it
9192106 we have presented the finance ministry with our forecastsfor the countrys socio economic development in 2009 inaccordance with which the pace of gdp growth is expected at 18percent

9192110 if the tatas are allowed to enter the retail sector it will spell disaster for small traders which trinamool congress will resist through movements
9192111 the marxists speak against imperialists but are in effect backing capitalists interests just like they are now doing in case of the tatas
9192112 we dont want a blockade and are not fools to obstruct our own people from joining our dharna programme we have not obstructed anybody
9192113 starting from singur to nandigram and rizwanur rehmans mysterious death case each time the cpm and its government have landed in a mess
9192114 he made no request to us for lifting our dharna which we explained to him did not result in blockade of the durgapur expressway as alleged
9192115 energy conservation is by far the best use of money
9192116 the question is why we are not doing more of this
9192117 assumption that as long as its got a renewable tag on it we can carrying on using energy at the level we have been
9192118 im not at all surprised to find a company trying to build new coal fired power stations using unfounded assumptions about the renewables industry
9192119 essentially what they are doing is taking a very simplistic analysis and arguing that we need to massively back up for the worst possible scenarios
9192120 its not surprising given their agenda is all about building massive coal fired power stations
9192121 under the current trading system for power you just wouldnt build it so clearly there has to be some sort of encouragement
9192122 a seismic event measuring 1 2 on the richter scale occurred at the elandsrand gold mine near carletonville at 9h42local time 0742 gmt and resulted in the death of twomineworkers
9192123 the localised seismic event occurred in the 105 32 w7 panelcausing an extensive fall of ground in the panel
9192124 the workplace has been stopped until further investigationshave been completed
9192125 it appears very well that the industry is very satisfiedwith its talkshops and lack of action
9192126 a mineworker lost his life at harmony golds elandsrandmine in carletonville this morning two more workers wereinjured after what is reportedly a seismic event
9192127 to our foreign partners i would simply say that success is inconceivable without the good collaboration i propose topursue with them
9192128 there can be no development without investment and noinvestment without investors we ask for transparency realismand respect for the mining law that is in effect
9192129 probably the best place all around of any site on the east coast
9192130 virginia beach is by far the best location we looked at
9192131 they run tour boats out to the turbines in europe
9192132 if wind energy development in the eastern u s is going to make a real rather than symbolic contribution to solving our energy and air pollution problems it will certainly be offshore development
9192133 especially when you consider the clean aspect of it and the sustainability side of it
9192134 if we can show them that were going to stay out of their way i think well be fine
9192135 prices are more affected down south while new york is supplied through new york harbor
9192136 i think some of those areas are going to get hit hard again and its really going to squeeze people
9192137 we are seeing gas price increases here that are based on the possibility that there may be some supply dislocation
9192138 that would affect supply close to the affected area as opposed to anywhere else
9192139 if it ever gets to the point where i know that im actually definitely for certain writing an episode of doctor who ill post it here in big red letters or green youll know when it happens trust me
9192140 the easy part as id written it in my head many times before
9192141 you couldnt have a whole series like that you cant have that as the first episode its just too grim so its different contemplating it from this position very very different
9192142 getting to write episodes that i wouldnt normally write that wouldnt be expected of me
9192143 the fifth series of the show due to be shown on bbc1 in spring 2010
9192144 it might kill someone over 60 i think i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
9192145 as long as it was great and fantastic than yes im not against the idea but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it

9192151 the new ranger is more powerful compared with courier offers improved functionality significantly increased three tonne towing ability when using a 3 0 litre manual transmission model fitted with a genuine ford towpack and load leveling kit and maintains a one tonne plus payload across the range ford engineers have built on the companys vast experience in trucks to deliver the ultimate one tonne vehicle with the performance and power to get the job done
9192152 at the same time we recognized that ranger had to be versatile enough to adapt to the changing needs of the light commercial owner in the 21st century it needs to be a combination of reliable work mate family vehicle lifestyle statement and an adventure vehicle we engineered ranger to deliver on all these expectations its the can do truck a truck that means business
9192153 it was a tough decision to change a name that has been part of the ford australia family since 1978 but the research was overwhelming the light commercial vehicle sector has changed dramatically in recent years with customers wanting more from their truck than just a reliable work vehicle todays light truck owner wants the best of both worlds a dependable genuine truck for the industrious worker and a great family vehicle with the quality comfort safety and modern conveniences they demand ranger researched well as a brand name that exemplified all these attributes
9192154 we listened to the market and focused our improvements on rangers classic rugged exterior its refined and comfortable interior exceptional diesel performance great driving feel and fantastic ability both on and off road

9192174 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9192175 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla

9192181 in november trumps lawyers sent a subpoena to times publisher arthur sulzberger jr seeking to question him about an e mail exchange with reporter timothy l obrien author of the 2005 biography
9192182 in the exchange obrien predicted that trump would go ballistic over portions of the book including an assertion that the donalds net worth was actually from 150 million to 250 million an amount not in keeping with trumps billionaire persona
9192183 sulzberger sought to quash the subpoena but this month the new york supreme court said he must submit to a deposition
9192184 but to me and im speaking now not as a someone who works for a competitor but as someone who has always adored reading the wall street journal the paper he is producing is less distinctive less interesting and less important to its core business readership
9192185 ill never stop subscribing to the journal just like ill never stop subscribing to the new yorker but it used to be that on days when i was too busy to read it i feared i was missing something this week i realized i dont feel that way anymore
9192186 one reader expressed the opinions of many readers in this e mail
9192187 i am very disappointed with your decision to only list a very limited list of daily stock quotes

9192224 the conquests of nebuchadnezzar uniting many kingdoms into one formed an important link in the long chain of events designed by god to prepare the way for the kingdom of christ if christianity had been introduced at an earlier period than it was it would have found the world divided into a large number of independent kingdoms commonly at war with one another no apostle could have traveled from kingdom to kingdom but at the risk of his life it pleased god therefore to raise up a succession of great conquerors whose work was to bring the kingdoms of the world into one

9192241 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9192242 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9192247 its aggressive pursuit of construction loans coupled with falling real estate values and inadequate risk management
9192248 construction loans were 76 percent of the banks total loan portfolio
9192249 assuming all of integrity banks 974 million in insured and uninsured deposits in 23 000 accounts and about 34 4 million of the banks 1 1 billion in assets
9192250 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9192251 we believe that the executions were an isolated incident and not part of a strategy to destabilise the state

9192258 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9192259 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9192260 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9192261 offensives are part of the strategy of defence and if a country confines itself to its borders it has set a limit and eliminated part of its capability
9192262 i communicate using photos when i saw the pictures of rose pizem her mother marie and the yarkon river i touched them and then everything was revealed to me
9192263 some from citizens asking to assist in the search from rose and others from people who gave us information we had already obtained
9192264 people see her as the symbol of purity in an atmosphere of corruption
9192265 im gonna f shoot your dad hes gonna get a lead bullet
9192266 many of those who had been in positions of power and authority have been very envious over the past year and a half with gov palins great popularity
9192267 as your governor i apologize i know alaska will overcome inevitable bumps in the road as we just traveled this week
9192268 someone has to take a stand and change some things
9192269 todd kept reminding me to bite my tongue saying good roads are comin good roads are comin
9192270 so far people have been forgiving of her but i dont know how long that can last
9192271 the allegations surfaced during the investigation but we had to do our due diligence
9192272 caseys attorney jose baez diligently tried to contact authorities to surrender his client
9192273 the arrest and the drama at the anthony home tonight only added insult upon injury for the family of the kidnapped child
9192274 this is a huge victory for the people of texas and i think for people across the country for academic freedom
9192275 there are 1 300 references to the bible in the works of shakespeare alone over 60 percent of the allusions studied in advanced placement english come from the bible students are going to be better academically and culturally when they hear about the bible
9192276 a lot of schools dont know they can have the course and this bill notifies them that the supreme court ruled school districts can offer it
9192277 school districts should know they can offer the course because it better prepares students for college literature and history classes
9192278 the bible as a text has historical and literary value
9192279 it cant go off into other religious philosophies because then it would be teaching religion when the course is meant to teach literature
9192280 the problem has been that school districts have been threatened by activists for offering the courses
9192281 now theyve got the state board of educations clear guidelines and support from the attorney general
9192282 religious literature including the hebrew scriptures old testament and new testament
9192283 a school district must of course offer instruction in the subject matter as required curriculum
9192284 the legislature did not mandate that this curriculum instruction be provided in independent courses
9192285 why is it that senator obama wants to sit down with the president of iran but
9192286 we can take about five and a half feet 1 67 meters of water above sea level but we cant take the nine to 12 feet 2 7 to 3 7 meters theyre talking about
9192287 im supposed to be leaving but i keep waiting just a little longer to see what the storm is going to do i know its a risk
9192288 this morning president bush called four governors whose states are in the potential path of hurricane gustav
9192289 president bush called to make sure the states were receiving all the assistance they needed from the federal government he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9192290 this measure will certainly increase the return but it is a process that will take time because people want to see first how it turns out
9192291 iraqi forces will be on alert from september 2 to evacuate the homes of the displaced families
9192292 i do not expect people to return in large numbers but it is certainly a positive step because one of the main concerns of these people is that others are occupying their homes
9192293 seventy percent of the occupied public buildings are held by militias
9192294 it is not just people who are occupying in some regions the militias took control of whole districts and leased it to refugees
9192295 there are terrorist groups who do not want the families to return and are preventing them from doing so the government and the army are closely tracking such cases
9192296 the russians have checkpoints and we still cannot bring these people back home the threat of paramilitary irregulars looting and robbing is still very high
9192297 apparently the russian military are not willing to prevent these kind of cases
9192298 we are not going to be drawn on the details of that conversation the next step will be the meeting on monday
9192299 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our in the course of the election struggle
9192300 my wife was physically sick and my son of 13 was brought to tears
9192301 whilst we acknowledge that this was a particularly dramatic episode we were very careful to make sure that any actual violence was implied rather than explicit and it was made clear from the outset that jases life was in serious jeopardy
9192302 this was the climax of a long running story involving jase and his former firm and we believe this was the outcome that many viewers would have been anticipating in the context of this storyline
9192303 whilst issues of violence and knife crime may be in the news currently they were not glamorised or glorified in any way within this episode rather we saw the devastating consequences of such actions and the clear message was that crime does not pay
9192304 we do appreciate that some viewers found the images of jases dead body uncomfortable however in trying to fully convey jays loss and depth of emotion we felt it was necessary for viewers to see what he was seeing
9192305 we understand that some viewers were upset but we signalled the nature of the content of the episode through the pre programme continuity announcement and billings
9192306 instead of dwelling on specifics he laced the crowning speech of his long campaign with the type of rhetorical flourishes that republicans mock
9192307 yasmin shah should go to our society and see for herself what the situation is like there and then come back to raise such questions in the house
9192308 this is a provincial matter and it is being investigated at the provincial level and let us wait for the report of the investigation
9192309 we left the governors compound in his car and then each went home in his own car
9192310 from what we know now the abductors must have followed him and kidnapped him the moment he got out of his car near the garage at his house
9192311 now we still have the federal defense of marriage act intact but frankly we should not have to continually hold our breath every time this issue goes before a judge wondering whether a judge with the stroke of a pen will undermine and rewrite the definition of marriage
9192312 most unfortunate this was an oppertunity for the court to put sexual discrimination in the trash as marrage is as much a legal contract between two people as it is a sacriment it should no must be available to all people reguardless
9192313 prop 8 will not succeed in california since it is clearly a
9192314 the most recent poll regarding the marriage amendment in ca shows it losing 54 to 40 the previous poll showed it losing 51 to 42
9192315 i have seen some polls that are very concerning on prop 8 they say that is may defeated and that is worrisome not only for ca but the rest of the country i hope that the people of ca come out in droves to approve prop 8 or they will regret it in the long run
9192316 thank you mr staver for a job well done your work has helped save god defined marriage
9192317 its 100 percent green living owen likes it so much that he made an offer on a home there
9192318 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9192319 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9192320 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9192321 i hope to get an artificial leg so i can have a chance at walking again
9192322 i dont have a real life in gaza its full of death and chaos
9192323 energy production front and center in the policy debate once again
9192324 shes viewed as almost anti oil shes probably pro oil from a national perspective but shes not in the pocket of big oil shes fought them at every step
9192325 weve decided not to discuss the shalit issue and do not intend to consider any list formulated by the occupation regime israel
9192326 israel must comply with the list we relayed to it
9192327 the egyptians will tell hamas that it wouldnt be prudent on its part to insist that israel free the additional 200 prisoners as some 10 000 more are being held in israel
9192328 a very clear effort on a national scale to discredit defame and intimidate
9192329 filtered internet is a must situation for an airline where the passengers are held captive during the flight they cant walk away from their neighbor who might be looking at pornography
9192330 they cant go to an open seat most airlines are full
9192331 i want flight attendants to take care of the safety of the airline and service the passengers
9192332 i dont think they should be hall monitors to see who is looking at pornography
9192333 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
9192334 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
9192335 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
9192336 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
9192337 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
9192338 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
9192339 he called the gas promotions in general a clever tool
9192340 church leaders have debated for years whether modern marketing techniques cheapen the faith or are an effective
9192341 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
9192342 we are going to change the constitution and say on nov
9192343 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
9192344 maam we are knocking on your door today to encourage to vote yes on not allowing gays to marry
9192345 the true worshippers will worship in spirit and in truth
9192346 america we are better than these last eight years obama said at invesco field in denver

9192348 a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
9192349 is this america the land of the free and the home of the brave
9192350 none of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps we got here because somebody a parent a teacher an ivy league crony or a few nuns bent down and helped us pick up our boots
9192351 shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will
9192352 challenges strengthen you build you when you dig out of a ditch on your own you know what it is when you get to the peak
9192353 i dont expect people to forget my harsh words or deeds
9192354 but i ask that they try to remember the actions that i took that were designed to help them
9192355 he would not africanize america for america has too much to teach the world and africa
9192356 he would not bleach his negro soul in a flood of white americanism for he knows that negro blood has a message for the world he simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a negro and an american without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows without having the doors of opportunity closed roughly in his face
9192357 i ran for the presidency despite hopeless odds to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo
9192358 the next time a woman runs or a black or a jew or anyone from a group that the country is not ready to elect to its highest office i believe that he or she will be taken seriously from the start in this country everybody is supposed to be able to run for president but that has never really been true
9192359 the united states government made the negro a citizen will it protect him as a citizen this is the problem
9192360 it made him a soldier will it honor him as a patriot this is the problem it made him a voter will it defend his right to vote this i say is more a problem for the nation than the negro and this is the side of the question far more than the other which should be kept in view by the american people
9192361 now im sick and tired of being sick and tired

9192406 if a player hasnt been training properly especially leading up to the season it will be noticeable right away when their season starts or when islanders training camp starts
9192407 now that all of the camps are over this gives them the opportunity to work on their training and strength development
9192408 expectations were set with every kid individually through the development team of bryan trottier and eric cairns along with strength and conditioning coach chris schwarz
9192409 every player was given full direction on how they should be progressing this summer with their training
9192410 when i started summer workouts it just starting to change into more than just running and lifting weights
9192411 plyometrics and lifting became bigger at the time these seemed like crazy things but now its the norm not everyone worked out then but now everyone has to especially the young players

9192521 if i want to buy a house ill buy my own i dont need a man for that
9192522 but question if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9192523 algo que eu n o posso encontrar usando o google
9192524 since if you lose it you can no longer send verified messages
9192525 pull yourself together and chuck away that bit of paper what are you really going to do
9192526 do let me read it you it has only forty three questions and answers and some of the marquiss answers are wonderfully witty i like to be just to my enemy
9192527 when the marquis has given the thirty ninth reply which runs
9192528 that the marquis may not say all the forty three things you have put down for him in that case i understand your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced
9192529 and i never thought of it sir you have an intellect beyond the common you will make a name
9192530 to adopt some other method of breaking the ice if i may so express it between myself and the man i wish to kill and since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen the only thing to be done i suppose is for the one party as far as possible to do all the dialogue by himself and so i will by george
9192531 that meeting that meeting displeases me i am going to pull that meetings great ugly mahogany coloured nose
9192532 but how can the marquis have insulted your aunt just now
9192533 except something about the band i only said that i liked wagner played well
9192534 my aunt played wagner badly it was a painful subject we are always being insulted about it
9192535 the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunts weaknesses
9192536 i for one have said nothing for half an hour except that i liked the singing of that girl with black hair
9192537 that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the marquis
9192538 seeking a fight with me by god there was never a man who had to seek long these gentlemen will perhaps act for me there are still four hours of daylight let us fight this evening
9192539 your action is worthy of your fame and blood permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands i shall place myself
9192540 i have fixed a fight on the beast but look here and listen carefully there is no time for talk you are my seconds and everything must come from you now you must insist and insist absolutely on the duel coming off after seven to morrow so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the 7 45 for paris if he misses that he misses his crime he cant refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place but this is what he will do he will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station where he can pick up the train he is a very good swordsman and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it but i can fence well too and i think i can keep him in play at any rate until the train is lost then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings you understand very well then let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine
9192541 to a man of the well known skill and valour of monsieur de st eustache
9192542 it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit but for the just and honourable nature of which i can
9192543 i am more than a devil i am a man i can do the one thing which satan himself cannot do i can die
9192544 our principal has wounded the marquis four times at least and he is none the worse
9192545 we are fighting to day if i remember right because you expressed a wish which i thought irrational to pull my nose would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible i have to catch a train
9192546 there is i think one case on record captain bellegarde and the baron zumpt in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants but one can hardly call ones nose a weapon
9192547 come come mr syme you wanted to do it do it you can have no conception of how important it is to me dont be so selfish pull my nose at once when i ask you
9192548 he can have it colonel ducroix do accept my left eyebrow its the kind of thing that might come in useful any day
9192549 that i was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight
9192550 you are making a mistake but it cant be explained just now i tell you the train has come into the station
9192551 you great fat blasted blear eyed blundering thundering brainless godforsaken doddering damned fool
9192552 have you all got softening of the brain that you dont realise what i am did you really think i wanted to catch that train twenty paris trains might go by for me damn paris trains
9192553 what did i care about i didnt care about catching the train i cared about whether the train caught me and now by god it has caught me
9192554 that your remarks convey no impression to my mind perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin your meaning would become clearer mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways what do you mean by saying that the train has caught you it may be my literary fancy but somehow i feel that it ought to mean something
9192555 and the end of everything sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand
9192556 my name is pretty well known to the police and i can see well enough that you belong to them
9192557 and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket
9192558 weve got enough of them to equip a paper chase
9192559 we all owe you a serious apology but i assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour
9192560 of course i accept the apology but you will in your turn forgive me if i decline to follow you further into your difficulties and permit myself to say good morning the sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual and upon the whole sufficient for one day colonel ducroix i would in no way influence your actions but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal i am now going to walk back to the town
9192561 no by george i wont if these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that ill see them through it i have fought for france and it is hard if i cant fight for civilization
9192562 by god if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the anarchist council were against anarchy every born man was a detective except the president and his personal secretary what can it mean
9192563 it means that we are struck dead dont you know sunday dont you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them can you think of anything more like sunday than this that he should put all his powerful enemies on the supreme council and then take care that it was not supreme i tell you he has bought every trust he has captured every cable he has control of every railway line especially of that railway line
9192564 the whole movement was controlled by him half the world was ready to rise for him but there were just five people perhaps who would have resisted him and the old devil put them on the supreme council to waste their time in watching each other idiots that we are he planned the whole of our idiocies sunday knew that the professor would chase syme through london and that syme would fight me in france and he was combining great masses of capital and seizing great lines of telegraphy while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind mans buff
9192565 he has found us playing blind mans buff to day in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude he has probably captured the world it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it and since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train i will tell you my objection was that sunday or his secretary has just this moment got out of it
9192566 it was a habit of the late marquis de st eustache
9192567 always to carry a pair of opera glasses either the president or the secretary is coming after us with that mob they have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police dr bull i have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles
9192568 there are a good number of them certainly but they may easily be ordinary tourists
9192569 could you possibly know your president among all those people
9192570 could i know a white elephant among all those people
9192571 as you very truly say they are on the horizon but if he were walking with them by god i believe this ground would shake
9192572 of course the president isnt with them i wish to gemini he were much more likely the president is riding in triumph through paris or sitting on the ruins of st pauls cathedral
9192573 something may have happened in our absence but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that it is quite true
9192574 it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way but they are not all the army that you make out
9192575 no they are not a very valuable force but let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value we are not much my boy in sundays universe he has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself but to kill the supreme council he regards as a trivial matter like a post card it may be left to his private secretary
9192576 there is a great deal to be said for death but if anyone has any preference for the other alternative i strongly advise him to walk after me
9192577 we must get down through the town of lancy to the sea
9192578 i think that part of the country is least likely to be with them
9192579 they cant be running the real world in that way surely not many working men are anarchists and surely if they were mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police
9192580 so you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question youve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor why should it the poor have been rebels but they have never been anarchists they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government the poor man really has a stake in the country the rich man hasnt he can go away to new guinea in a yacht the poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly the rich have always objected to being governed at all aristocrats were always anarchists as you can see from the barons wars
9192581 as a lecture on english history for the little ones
9192582 this is all very nice but i have not yet grasped its application
9192583 that most of old sundays right hand men are south african and american millionaires that is why he has got hold of all the communications and that is why the last four champions of the anti anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits
9192584 they are nearly all mad but getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing getting hold of great christian nations is another i would bet the nose off my face forgive the allusion that sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere
9192585 that this man at least will never be an anarchist
9192586 if only for the reason that he has plenty of property to defend but i forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy
9192587 how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart those dogs are all on foot and we could soon leave them behind
9192588 he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain
9192589 you do not understand he would not see the meaning of generosity he is not being tipped
9192590 thats discipline thats sunday he is perhaps five hundred miles off but the fear of him is on all of them like the finger of god yes they are walking regularly and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly yes and thinking regularly but the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly
9192591 and i will give first not the most important but the most utilitarian we came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses
9192592 if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you unless of course you have bicycles and motor cars in your pocket
9192593 you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town my friend whom i seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising but even he would hardly maintain i suppose that you were not safe with the gendarmes
9192594 is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death
9192595 you may be quite certain that i gave orders the moment i came in those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry but they were really moving wonderfully fast like a well trained army i had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline you have not a moment to waste
9192596 i have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others lives

9192606 he learned to read of an old dame and soon received such delight from books that he was always calling for fresh entertainment and expected that when any of the family went to market a new book should be brought him which when it came was in fondness carried to bed and laid by him it is said that when his request had been neglected his mother wrapped up a piece of wood of the same form and pacified him for the night

9192666 jpepa is an essential aspect of the japanese relocation strategy and jpepas benefits will be accruing mostly to the japanese subsidiaries in the philippines
9192667 this essentially places japanese nationals and their investments at parity with filipinos
9192668 if very little preference is extended to the filipino vis vis the japanese investors under the jpepa what is the value of being a filipino in your own national economy
9192669 without the benefit of seeing the actual document it would be very difficult to come up with a definitive analysis favorable or otherwise
9192670 any amendment to the agreement entered into by the philippines with japan should at least go through a similar process at a minimum

9192672 in order to achieve this goal the philippines under jpepa drastically eliminated tariffs across the board exempting only six tariff lines for rice and salt and negotiated on issues that it would not even do so under the world trade organization
9192673 the long list of japanese exclusions long term phaseout of tariffs and deferred market negotiations under jpepa severely restricted agricultural gains by the philippines under jpepa
9192674 even without the jpepa these products already enter japan duty free jpepa did not change anything philippine garments and footwear exporters cannot take advantage of the duty free provision under jpepa because their raw materials do not comply with jpepa rules of origin which mandates in part that the raw materials come primarily from japan or any of the asean countries

9192726 the lounge is an extension of my donna toscana tuscan style line of chocolates
9192727 having established and expanded the donna toscana brand over the past three years the lounge was the next natural step
9192728 i immediately fell in love with the tuscan chocolatiers sensibilities in their approach to chocolate confections
9192729 incorporating old world craftsmanship with modern sensibilities these chocolate masters create some of the richest and most unique confections in the world
9192730 there is something special about the tuscan region that just says welcome and i wanted my lounge to greet my customers in the same way
9192731 working with my designer i maintained the original high tin ceiling and walls in the space added earth tones of the tuscan countryside arranged comfortable caf seating with tables covered in imported italian cloths and set an intimate tone with discrete lamps and a rustic chandelier over the main table

9192735 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9192736 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9192737 our home is like a merry go round it keeps knocking me down hold on a second hold on a second i need it to stop spinning
9192738 this is a naked lady song dance like a naked lady
9192739 when im bigger i can pee standing up of course
9192740 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina after a recent phone call from lindsay while she was traveling on one of samanthas dj gigs i became very concerned
9192741 everything was arranged and agreed i have dozens of texts and recordings with dina to prove it
9192742 a day later dina told me that sam was writing a book that sam was a negative influence on lindsay and that sam needs to be out of lindsays life then she asked me how to do it
9192743 matters became worse when dina said lindsay was in real danger and
9192744 to even imagine that dina would then go on vacation is even more sickening
9192745 dina cares please lindsay was once stalked by a guy name deleted who dina trusted and i said from the get go that i didnt only for dina to look the other way when i had to get a task force to track him down
9192746 dina took a percentage of lindsays money when i never took a red cent all the while i only speak out when something is wrong or needs to be made right
9192747 dina is a money loving fame seeking self serving deceiver who comes from roots of the same
9192748 while guilt may bring a response by some others like dina pass the buck and dont accept any responsibility at all
9192749 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
9192750 shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells
9192751 if you want to know the whole story youve got to be my friend its easy to put those labels on people but theyre not accurate were young in hollywood having fun
9192752 theyre trying to earn a buck in a fun way so theyre doing what they can to feed that demand and make money
9192753 through my documentary ive realized how insignificant all that is because i know who i am take one part truth and 1 000 parts speculation and heresy and youve got yourself a tabloid story
9192754 ive shut up about this long enough shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
9192755 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
9192756 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
9192757 i go to church i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control
9192758 needless to say i was a little despondent about the meltdown
9192759 i counsel you to be conscious of allah for it will beautify your whole affair
9192760 recite the quran and make remembrance of allah taala for it is remarked of you in the heavens and a light for you on the earth
9192761 be silent often for it casts satan out and it aids you in your religious affairs
9192762 beware of much laughter for it kills the heart and takes the light of the face
9192763 let what you know about yourself prevent you from finding fault in others
9192764 look at those who are lower than you note that is in worldly affairs and do not look at those who are higher than you for it will be better to facilitate your not taking allahs blessings upon you lightly
9192765 let that which you know about yourself prevent you from the people note that is let the faults that you know you have prevent you from speaking about others and their deeds for it is doubtful that you are free of defects like the defects of other people or uglier whether you recognize it or not sharh al munawi and do not take issue with what they do note that is do not be angry with them for what they do to you sharh al munawi ala al jami al saghir it is enough of a defect that you should recognize in people that which you ignore in yourself
9192766 o abu dharr there is no intelligence like being prepared and no piety like abstinence note that is from that which the heart is troubled concerning its permissibility or impermissibility
9192767 i think i would remember jennies fist connecting with a part of my body or a part of my face
9192768 it just goes to show you how people will lie
9192769 the court waived his appearance for that hearing he still must appear at future hearings
9192770 using an intuitive interface similar to the games detailed character creator players can create missions from the ground up players will determine details ranging from environments mission objectives and enemies to written fiction and character dialogue giving their stories nearly infinite depth and personalisation
9192771 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
9192772 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again wanting things to change even though people have said some people will forever remain the same having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embaressment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has not and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful this further proves that any information that my father has about me or the people in my life is internet based and about as accurate as a page six item im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the the camera man at x17
9192773 ive shut up about this long enough shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
9192774 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
9192775 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
9192776 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but for me i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him i am not standing in his way i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is his need to throw a tantrum for the whole world to hear is i am not going to go into a play by play defense i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living i am always will and always have been here for her for her not for anything else so i think its safe to say that there is not now and never will be a tell all written by me when does your book come out mr lohan
9192777 so you and 10 of your closest friends made it to destin ok
9192778 yes were on the beach and i just got out of the ocean

9192792 today we begin a new phase of mohegan suns continuing growth as one of the premier gaming and entertainment destinations in the world
9192793 following in the footsteps of casino of the earth and casino of the sky the rockwell group again utilized our tribal traditions in their design and conception for the new casino of the wind
9192794 the central idea behind the design of casino of the wind is the re interpretation of wind as it moves through space transforming the surface it touches
9192795 watg has created an addition that blends gracefully and seamlessly both aesthetically and functionally with the existing casino of the sky entrance and yet is large enough to contain gaming food amp beverage and casino support functions
9192796 we have worked countless hours with the mohegan tribe to ensure their vision became a reality
9192797 just months shy of the 13th anniversary of mohegan sun we stand here today to celebrate yet another major milestone in our history the opening of casino of the wind
9192798 as we get ready to celebrate labor day this coming weekend i would like to thank the core of our success our employees and congratulate those staff who have recently been hired as we grow with casino of the wind
9192799 were very excited about bringing the margaritaville experience to mohegan sun
9192800 we believe weve found a perfect complement to that island state of mind in new englands largest and most exciting gaming destination

9192805 east west just points of the compass each as stupid as the other i work for spectre special executive for counter intelligence terrorism revenge extortion the four great cornerstones of power headed by the greatest brains in the world
9192806 unfortunately i overestimated you mr bond you are just a stupid police man whose luck has run out
9192807 we want to share our very friendly and casual approach to wine with our guests
9192808 my career has been defined by this quest explains johnnes
9192809 if you look at the two areas as a whole
9192810 the less i planned the more things fell exactly into place
9192811 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
9192812 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
9192813 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
9192814 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
9192815 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9192816 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9192817 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9192818 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9192819 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9192820 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9192821 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9192822 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9192823 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9192824 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9192825 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9192826 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9192827 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

9192829 what happened to your cheek did someone hurt you my daughter tell me ill make sure that person will never see sunlight again

9192833 so this is your greeting to me after many years we finally met again hiromi chan
9192834 thanks to you it gives me more wrinkles on my forehead
9192835 i always wonder who gave you that necklace it seems like its a treasure to you
9192836 you know how i liked to go to the park and play soccer back then i met her there when i was thirteen and she was twelve we started to become friends because we both like to play soccer soon we were close friends but i dont really know much about her background and vice versa one day we wanted to buy souvenirs so we bought two necklaces one necklace has a key face and the other has a lock face and we asked the seller to engrave forever on the lock face and together on the key i chose a lock face because it looks manly
9192837 because after my sisters death i was too shocked so i shut everything out of my mind i only wanted to focus on finding out who was the culprit after that incident i stopped seeing her and moved to tokyo to study in order to become a detective
9192838 and you met me would you be back with her if you see her again
9192839 who knows she might be in love with someone else already if we are destined to be together fate will let us meet again
9192840 anyway back to work lousy girl i should charge you money for asking too many questions
9192841 yoshizawa it seems that this class isnt the type to entertain you right
9192842 can i have you solve this math problem whats 2 1
9192843 well when one person falls in love with two people since he she cant decide who to be with so he she ends up with no one having no one at the end isnt that zero
9192844 no doubt that she is hiromi chan only she and i know about this theory
9192845 i really like your theory but this is a math class not philosophy class so please dont give any meaningless answer everyone concentrate now
9192846 what the this is nothing but kidnapping you can let go of my arm you know
9192847 if it wasnt because of my duty i would have left you already
9192848 wow youre so handsome whats your name and how old are you
9192849 if you guys dont get away from her ill make you guys regret for this
9192850 are you done choosing a dress and why do you need one suddenly
9192851 geez most of the stuffs she chose were pink i wonder if her panties are pink too
9192852 yossie smirked to herself she then came up with a plan she pretended to drop her key and bent down to pick it up she took peek under rikas skirt
9192853 i guess youre all talk on the outside but deep down inside youre just a pervert
9192854 alright im done with my dress now lets look a suit for you
9192855 hiromi let me help you pay half of the price
9192856 no riko gentlemen dont let girls pay and i dont like using girls money this is a gift from me to you so let me pay
9192857 so many years and youre still like that acting as a gentleman a stubborn one also
9192858 wait i need to give you a ride back since i brought you here
9192859 its ok i dont want to give you any trouble
9192860 geez most of the stuffs she chose were pink i wonder if her panties are pink too
9192861 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
9192862 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
9192863 im not sure whether you know or not but you arent the first person that yossy assaulted
9192864 yossy has a disorder in which she cannot control her libido
9192865 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
9192866 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
9192867 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you
9192868 just ride the elevator all the way to the top and your room is up there
9192869 get your ass out of here before you touch her
9192870 you have a few broken ribs and a fairly nasty black eye
9192871 you shoulda seen the look i gave everyone this morning when i came down with koharu
9192872 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency

9192876 i know all about you sex for dinner death for breakfast
9192877 well i need to know coz if he breaks your heart i gotta know how much to hate him
9192878 something came up but nothing your to chan cant handle
9192879 i had two more meetings after you left and i had to do some paperwork
9192880 i think shes rooting for me to get to third base
9192881 ka chan no need to be embarrassed anyway we can always take this to our room if you want complete privacy
9192882 she has executive experience and as i said before senator obama has not

9193095 also none of the movies releasing friday are family oriented and neither the music of any of these movies has garnered a good response
9193096 the advance booking for all the four movies has been average as the crowd is less during ramadan the movies havent even been marketed well also these dont have an appealing star cast with a good market value
9193097 times have changed quite dramatically the film is surely going to run whatever it may be people by now have a fare idea about my movie and i am sure they are going to watch it
9193098 we are betting on rock on farhan is an acclaimed director and rock on marks his acting and singing debut prachi desai too will attract fans who have seen her on tv
9193099 though some of the films form the previous weeks are still doing well like singh is kinng and bachna ae haseeno we are trying to accommodate all the films considering the time and the target audience
9193100 it is not that films that have released during ramadan didnt do well in the past in fact i look at it as an added advantage to my film because no big films would be releasing during the festive period
9193101 we have tried our movie for a ramadan release because it is very advantageous for us as the protagonist in the movie converts to islam as to be an undercover spy and when he battles terror he chooses to be a muslim
9193102 i had a lot of preconceived ideas about this film of the kind of views that it was going to push but i have to say it did examine the issues from both sides
9193103 however that said i strongly feel that shoot on sight cynically exploits the tragic shooting of de menezes and the events leading up to it
9193104 i think that showing this in cinemas can only add to the distress and grief felt by the de menezes family and the survivors of 7 7 and those who lost loved ones on that day
9193105 the hurt and pain doesnt go away overnight but ultimately it wasnt the predictable plot or poor acting that caused offence to me but the cynical attempt to make money from a tragic event
9193106 for example the police officer who shoots the muslim man isnt portrayed as a cut and dried racist i thought it was quite a clever twist that the police commissioner who is put in charge with investigating the shooting is a muslim himself
9193107 i thought it was pretty tacky that they clearly used the de menezes shooting as the basis for the plot i wouldnt be happy if i was a member of his family
9193108 i dont understand why they made the character who was so clearly based on de menezes muslim rather than brazilian it was clearly just to provoke controversy i dont think i would ever go and see this film at the cinema but it isnt as anti english as i was expecting
9193109 mallika is expected to arrive here in the next few days and give the final approval to complete her home
9193110 this is a one hall and one bedroom hut and built with mud and overlooks the majestic arabian sea near vizhinjam im sorry i cant reveal the exact location the roof of the hut is yet to be decided and it would be finalised once she is here most probably it would be one with bamboo and tiles
9193111 unlike in the south actors in north india like amitabh bachchan dharmendra and rajesh khanna dont bring with them any new aspiration
9193112 they dont represent regional nationalism they are not a success
9193113 i feel that a lot of stars join politics because they are swayed by others they are told they are popular so they can join politics
9193114 i feel it depends upon the individuals and their motivation
9193115 people all over india are looking for alternatives to existing power set ups so chiranjeevis entry into politics comes as no surprise
9193116 amitabh bachchan was a disaster but sunil dutt was so good as a politician maybe because amitabhs heart was not in it whereas sunil dutt was always concerned about social issues
9193117 that is why one sees stars from the hindi film world mostly only during elections
9193118 for some stars approaching retirement as actors politics is a surefire way of extending their public life for the more serious star politicians its a way of using their popularity to further a political agenda but only the really committed succeed
9193119 in south india these actors bring with them a regional nationalist flavour and try to fulfil middle class aspirations
9193120 while chiranjeevi may gather a sizeable number of votes it has to be remembered that he will have to face two well entrenched political outfits the congress and tdp telugu desam party
9193121 if one has to go by the law of averages indications are that chiranjeevi may split the anti congress votes as he is projecting himself as a clear contender for the chief ministers post and actually end up helping tdp
9193122 if they go over this danger level we have to ask them to play more quietly
9193123 akshay has signed a utv film hopefully we should be teaming up there
9193124 theres no bad blood with studio 18 its just that things didnt work out but i am directing another film for them which might star ranbir kapoor and deepika padukone
9193125 i have worked with akshay for eight years i really respect him for the way he has groomed himself he has become one of the biggest metrosexual stars most stylish fashion icon and he is so successful that i am proud of him just look from where he has come and where he has reached
9193126 i started designing for akshay in 1992 but i stopped working with him in 2000 because i had to move on also both of us needed to take a break from each other
9193127 i started 16 years back at that time the only opportunity i got was in bollywood i think it was good for me as it has created awareness about my brand i have met a lot of actors who want to wear clothes designed by me
9193128 the people i dress up are the best dressed they are really great with clothes they have a great body to carry off anything and they have a good style of their own
9193129 shilpa likes deeper and rich indian colours she likes to wear emerald she loves red and it really suits her even bipasha likes red katrina likes pastel and lighter shades
9193130 it is fun to work with actors and also challenging to make them look different every time it is also a challenge for them to get into a character every time with different clothes and looks a lot of hard work is required in bollywood
9193131 when i started fashion was not even taking off in a very big manner and i think it was after four to five years that i felt the need to do creative work for myself thats when i started doing clothes that were more wearable and saleable
9193132 i came at the right time for mainstream fashion luckily i have kept a very good balance between bollywood and mainstream fashion till now
9193133 there are a lot of us who emotionally would love to do it
9193134 but its really chris call chris is the kind of filmmaker who just doesnt think about the next movie before he has completely finished the movie he is working on
9193135 when he comes back we will see how he feels
9193136 the most important thing to try to do is to maintain respect for each other respect in how you communicate
9193137 sometimes with family its where youre the most comfortable that you dont put out very much effort
9193138 really starts with the older people under the roof to raise the bar and be respectful
9193139 you cannot yell at your children and expect them to treat you with respect
9193140 the most important thing to try to do is to maintain respect for each other respect in how you communicate
9193141 sometimes with family its where youre the most comfortable that you dont put out very much effort
9193142 really starts with the older people under the roof to raise the bar and be respectful
9193143 you cannot yell at your children and expect them to treat you with respect
9193144 the sharjah show was extremely successful we are now organizing a series of shows across europe and the middle east saif and kareena have a huge fan following in these places people throng to the stadium to watch them especially after the success of race and jab we met also saif and kareena make a wonderful pair they are both good looking and exude power that makes the audience go wow saif and kareena gave solo performances and the results are evident with the success of jashan 2008 so we can imagine the response when the duo performs together
9193145 the show had a crowd of 20 000 people and it was just amazing saif is in talks with the morani brothers for the shows across europe and the middle east
9193146 i am looking forward to be on stage for the shows to be held across europe and the middle east

9193173 forget owning one i wish i could at least drive one of these cars
9193174 look for the job of a driver of one of these cars if the owners are rich enough to buy such cars probably they will pay well too you have to just drive the car and maintain it good condition
9193175 sir considers me almost like a family member though i am only his driver he has changed my life he says he will increase my salary next month

9193178 again an irrelevant question thats an obvious attempt to distract from the real issue human beings have a right to life no matter there size or intelligence or there dependency on others
9193179 if you saw an anthrax bomb but only had time to toss in front of three young women or just leave it a room of six terminal cancer patients who would you choose to suffer a horrible death
9193180 do you hate women or do you think sick people should just hurry up and die i just really want to know how evil you are
9193181 your question like mine doesnt answer the question when do humans have basic rights like the right to live no matter what crazy question that your immoral heart comes up with you cannot get around the issue of what abortion is really about murder but as an atheist without a moral ground without sound reasoning foolish questions crazy hypothetical situations and pointless rhetoric is all you have retort away
9193182 no systematic failure to report incidents on the evvrs many actions taken by district contributed to the decline the department will take no further action
9193183 consistency in how we address issues has been the most important thing for us
9193184 we make the students and their parents sign off on a student expectations manual it is easier to hold students accountable for their actions
9193185 it wasnt as if we singled out kids we thought were in gangs but they were the ones causing the most problems and they were expelled

9193189 inexperience i think inexperience and a lack of judgment and a record that shows that
9193190 i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9193191 when the vehicle did not stop after several signals the german forces opened fire at the car
9193192 when the forces later checked the vehicle they found two children and a woman dead and four other children wounded in the vehicle
9193193 first a vehicle approached the checkpoint but escaped when the forces tried to stop it
9193194 the forces opened fire at the second vehicle which was driving behind the first one and did not heed repeated signals by the forces
9193195 i saw with my own eyes bodies of 50 boys and girls under 15 years of age
9193196 i saw 19 women and seven men i helped locals to dig them out of rubble the first day
9193197 we lined up the bodies of 76 civilians the first day in the local mosque and the afghan intelligence department took a video recording as proof that most of them were women children and all civilians
9193198 there is no doubt that 90 civilians were killed in the us led air strike
9193199 it was public knowledge that it was a gathering for the ceremony and there were no taliban there

9193214 but to sentence someone the public prosecutor doesnt have to show probable responsibility he has to show solid proof of the responsibility of the defendants
9193215 i asked him why he had made that decision about the sentence and he said it came down from higher up he only had limited jurisdiction and shouldnt go any further but instead tend to other things the magistrate was the one who gave the orders

9193274 estoy muy ilusionado este es el momento en el que empieza todo esperamos subir al podio y superar las 76 medallas de atenas
9193275 yo quiero la medalla la esgrima es un deporte m gico he entrenado como un loco y creo que se puede conseguir aunque el nivel es muy fuerte y sobre todo los chinos van muy bien preparados
9193276 estoy muy nervioso son mis primeros juegos pero tambi n estoy ilusionado me he pasado todo este ltimo a o entrenando duro y estudiando vamos a disfrutar y a hacerlo lo mejor que podamos
9193277 aunque tambi n intentaremos salir un poco en nuestro tiempo de ocio
9193278 estoy casi con m s nervios que l es un viaje muy largo si pudiese no dudar a en ir con l pero a pesar de todo estamos muy contentos y creo que s que tienen posibilidades de ganar
9193279 creo que nuestros deportistas paral mpicos son un gran ejemplo de c mo somos capaces de convertirnos en potencia mundial del deporte
9193280 yo tengo la guardia al rev s con la pierna derecha adelantada adem s estas peque as molestias no me van a impedir luchar
9193281 las medallas ser n las que tengan que ser yo voy a dar todo lo que tengo dentro y esperemos que algo nos podamos traer pero no me gusta vender la piel del oso antes de cazarla as que soy muy cauto respecto a este tema
9193282 llevo trabajando con muchas ganas para estar en la mejor forma posible para competir y creo que lo he conseguido voy a intentar hacerlo lo mejor posible y si hay algui n que va m s r pido que yo pues habr que felicitarlo
9193283 en principio correr estas cinco pruebas mi preferida es la de 50 metros donde espero repetir triunfo y poder brind rselo como ya hice en 2004 a la ciudad de vigo que siempre me muestra su apoyo adem s tengo la esperanza de que si el seleccionador lo cree conveniente puedo correr una prueba m s la de 4x100 libres
9193284 m s nervioso en lo que al viaje se refiere no por la competici n
9193285 el comit paral mpico espa ol pone unas marcas m s dif ciles para que no sea simplemente conseguir la m nima llegar a pek n y a la primera eliminatoria te quedas fuera
9193286 hay que empezar a preparar la temporada que entra e ir a las competiciones para ir mejorando
9193287 posibilidades de medalla hay aunque haya un grupo con marcas parecidas pero todo depende tambi n de la suerte del d a si es un d a bueno oro si es un d a regular plata y si es un d a malo bronce
9193288 llego a unos tiempos en los que puedo batir el r cord mundial
9193289 y ser alentado por alguien a qui n admiras marca mucho
9193290 lo nico que les preocupa es el deporte de la foto grande
9193291 con los juegos a s lo una semana debemos tratar de realizar nuestro mejor esfuerzo en la preparaci n organizaci n y trabajo de seguridad en esta fase final
9193292 contar n con m s pa ses y regiones participantes que ningunos paral mpicos previos
9193293 el xito de los juegos de beijing ofreci una gran experiencia para ofrecer unos paral mpicos excelentes exitosos y apasionados
9193294 creo que no va a variar mucho en representaciones anteriores los deportistas paral mpicos se preparan con bastante tiempo dedicaci n porque tenemos que convencer a las personas que nos apoyan y que creen es este tipo de deporte
9193295 lo m s seguro es que estos atletas se traigan muchas medallas definitivamente vimos la delegaci n de los ol mpicos que fue muy numerosa y desafortunadamente los resultados fueron muy pobres y los paral mpicos es una delegaci n m s peque a pero considero que s van a venir mejores resultados calculo que aproximadamente llegar n con 15 medallas
9193296 yo tengo mucha confianza la confianza es tirarse al vac o sin mirar a donde vas a caer y ese es mi caso
9193297 los resultados no los s hasta despu s pero la confianza la llevo y siempre tengo presente tres ideas que por ah le y que me parecieron excelentes y las adopt para m empieza donde est s utiliza lo que tienes y haz lo que puedas y eso es lo que voy a hacer en beijing
9193298 en lo que corresponde a los atletas paral mpicos recibimos bastante presi n pues desde peque os nosotros estamos acostumbrados a trabajar m s all del umbral del dolor que la mayor a de la gente
9193299 soportamos m s carga de trabajo m s presi n y obviamente eso se refleja en resultados
9193300 es un premio doble uno porque no cualquiera da la marca para ir a los juegos ol mpicos y dos porque tengo el apoyo de mi esposa y de mi hija
9193301 estamos muy contentos porque en lo personal a estas para olimpiadas van muchos amigos m os la verdad vamos bien representados s de lo que est n hechos ya que la mayor a son parte de la delegaci n donde asist a brasil el a o pasado
9193302 lamentablemente en lo personal me faltaron dos metros para dar marca y asistir a los juegos en beijing china
9193303 hay que salir a decidir uno mismo conozco a nueve de los once posibles rivales pues nunca he combatido con el atleta chino y el colombiano espero un buen resultado por ser mi ltima paralimpiada
9193304 cuando se encienda la llama paral mpica con el fuego recogido en el templo de cielo en beijing deseamos de todo coraz n que los juegos paral mpicos sean igual de magn ficos por lo noble de esta competici n entre deportistas discapacitados qu la llama transmita la pasi n y el sue o y una los corazones de los atletas paral mpicos con el de todos los dem s que se conjuguen de manera com n los esfuerzos de los deportistas con el de los miembros del movimiento art stico y musical de la nueva cita deportiva
9193305 la pantalla puede soportar un peso de dos toneladas por cada metro cuadrado por lo que no hay problema de que 10 000 personas bailen sobre ella a la vez
9193306 tras el espect culo tuvimos que retirarla en menos de dos horas
9193307 los enviamos a los centros de rehabilitaci n de la ciudad para ofrecer servicios aprender a comunicarse mejor con los discapacitados y mejorar sus habilidades
9193308 es la primera vez que asisto a un certamen de esta magnitud y por ello es una experiencia nica ac no se trata de los cuatro deportistas que vamos a competir sino que la misi n es dejar en alto el nombre del per cada uno somos conscientes de eso
9193309 esta vez tengo que decir que no llevo la presi n de ganar la medalla de oro porque no soy favorito
9193310 en estos momentos se encuentran en sierra nevada espa a cumpliendo con su ltima fase de entrenamiento y haciendo un tope de altura
9193311 aqu correr en las tres distancias 100 200 y 400 metros y espero que sea un buen a o para m como el 2007
9193312 al igual que todos los del atletismo nos hemos preparado muy bien para dar grandes alegr as al pueblo bien fuerte se ha entrenado como lo exigen estas competencias as que el resto es darlo todo en el terreno
9193313 con mucho trabajo y dedic ndole todo el tiempo a la actividad del entrenamiento deportivo creo que es el esfuerzo de cada d a lo que me ha permitido ganar esas medallas
9193314 la intensidad de la vida deportiva se puede aumentar o disminuir depende de la concentraci n y el esfuerzo que hagamos para aprovechar mejor toda la capacidad f sica y yo he logrado esto
9193315 no ha sido f cil mucho sacrificio he pasado pr cticamente toda mi vida en un lugar albergado dedicando s bado y domingo y en ocasiones mi descanso a los entrenamiento sin fiestas sin ninguna diversi n la clave del xito esta en saber decir no a una fiesta no a una noche de jolgorio ten a 18 a os cuando comenc en el alto rendimiento
9193316 recuerdo que en aquellos tiempos mi dolo era el destacado fondista cubano alberto cuba yo quer a ser como l
9193317 una vez me dijeron que no pod a correr m s porque ten a una lesi n cr nica en la tibia derecha una periostitis acababa de cumplir 20 a os los especialistas me los aseguraron en ese tono
9193318 viv a muy distante a la pista donde entrenaba y todos los d as cargaba con un enorme pedazo de hielo a los entrenamientos porque ten a que pon rmelo enseguida que finalizaba mi preparaci n no fue f cil el calor la distancia el hielo derriti ndose aquello dur todo un a o pero me repuse felizmente
9193319 en los 5 000 mucho m s que en los 10 000 distancia esta donde he tenido mis mejores resultados por mis caracter sticas
9193320 los 10 000 metros actualmente se han convertido en una carrera muy r pida el desarrollo del deporte ha hecho que los tiempos y las marcas cada d a sean superiores hoy el ranking del mundo est sobre los 32 minutos y yo gan la plata de atenas04 con 32 04
9193321 despu s de atenas tuve una lesi n en el tend n de aquiles de la pierna derecha y aunque ya estoy completamente restablecido nunca m s pude soportar las cargas de entrenamiento para los 10 000
9193322 un a o con vol menes de trabajo que me hacen sentir optimista y creo que podr superarme a mi mismo

9193495 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9193496 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9193497 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9193498 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9193499 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9193500 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9193501 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9193502 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9193503 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9193504 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9193505 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9193506 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9193507 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9193508 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9193509 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9193510 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9193511 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9193512 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9193513 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9193514 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9193515 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9193516 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9193517 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9193518 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9193519 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9193520 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9193521 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9193522 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9193523 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9193524 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9193525 who are open to doing something on the production side
9193526 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9193527 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9193528 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9193529 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9193530 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9193531 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9193532 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9193533 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9193534 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9193535 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

9193539 that i wish i could have told my mom that i love her one more time before she passed away
9193540 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9193541 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9193542 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9193543 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9193544 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9193545 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9193546 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9193547 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9193548 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

9193563 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9193564 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9193565 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

9193568 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

9193570 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9193571 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9193572 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9193614 arbeiteten wir am chassis und aufh ngungssetup um die richtige basis f r diese hitze zu finden am nachmittag verglichen wir noch ein paar hinterreifen f r das rennen miteinander als ich dann auf qualifyern rausfuhr war meine pace ziemlich schnell aber es war ein hartes qualifying erst ein sehr guter flyer auf meiner allerletzten runde brachte mich auf den vierten startplatz
9193615 das rennen wird sehr eng da ist es wichtig weit vorne zu starten damit man anschluss zur spitze halten kann
9193616 ich bin gl cklich denn ich war hinter drei werksmotorr dern schnellster honda fahrer und das bedeutet dass meine crew gemeinsam mit michelin exzellente arbeit geleistet hat ich m chte mich bei den jungs wirklich f r ihre bem hungen bedanken
9193617 wir hatten die meldung bekommen dass es vielleicht zu einer besch digung sicherheitsrelevanter bereiche gekommen ist
9193618 deswegen hat man sich hier f r einen abbruch entschieden
9193619 das ist im trockenen eine meiner besseren startpositionen der saison also machen wir fortschritte
9193620 meine rennpace ist stark und ich glaube dass wir mit einem guten start um ein podium fighten k nnen
9193621 ich bekam einfach diese eine runde nicht perfekt auf die reihe
9193622 wir stellten das setup um und testeten viele reifen aus unserem sortiment f r die hei en bedingungen probierte ich einige der h rteren mischungen die gut zu funktionieren scheinen die qualifyer harmonierten mit dem neuen chassis auch nicht schlecht aber ich bekam einfach diese eine runde nicht perfekt auf die reihe daher blieb uns die zweite startreihe verwehrt
9193623 ein bisschen ver rgert denn gestern fanden wir ein wirklich gutes setup und auch heute morgen lief es nicht schlecht am nachmittag war es aber hei er wir stellten ein paar sachen um und schon ging nichts mehr trotzdem bin ich zuversichtlich f r das rennen
9193624 denn ich werde es aggressiv angehen und mein rhythmus auf rennreifen ist wirklich gut warten wir ab
9193625 dass er im rennen viel besser abschneiden kann er hat feuer in den augen insofern erwarte ich von ihm morgen eine gro e show
9193626 toll dass ich bei meinem heimrennen aus der ersten startreihe losfahren kann danke an mein team alle haben einen super job gemacht wir haben ein gro artiges auto und starkes technisches paket ich bin zuversichtlich f r das rennen morgen ich hoffe dass wir dann auch ein gutes teamergebnis einfahren
9193627 brands hatch ist nicht gerade meine lieblingsstrecke aber ich habe das beste rausgeholt und finde platz drei ganz ok das auto lief perfekt und mein team hat mich immer dann auf die strecke geschickt wenn kein verkehr war danke daf r an alle das war super
9193628 ich bin schon etwas entt uscht denn nach der bestzeit im zweiten qualifying konnte ich mich im dritten teil als es darauf ankam nicht weiter steigern und meine q2 zeit h tte immerhin am ende f r platz zwei gereicht doch vom f nften platz aus bin ich noch vorne mit dabei das ist nicht so schlecht es wird ein langes und anstrengendes rennen ber 82 runden da kann viel passieren wait and see
9193629 es tut mir leid dass ich meinen jungs durch den abflug ganz zu beginn zus tzliche arbeit verschaffte danke dass sie das auto so schnell repariert haben es war danach mit neuem frontspoiler sogar noch schneller ich hatte richtig spa im qualifying und freue mich auf das rennen morgen
9193630 das war knapp und ich wei noch nicht warum es nicht gereicht hat das auto war sehr gut und deshalb bin ich mir sicher es lag nicht am auto es lag an mir aber morgen bin ich besser unterwegs
9193631 die unterbrechungen mit gelben und roten flaggen haben mich etwas aus dem rhythmus gebracht ich habe nicht geschafft was zu schaffen gewesen w re siehe gary
9193632 ich habe leider keine perfekte runde hinbekommen zudem habe ich in der letzten kurve noch einen fehler gemacht
9193633 diese strecke sieht so einfach aus aber es ist schwierig hier die richtige linie zu finden zudem fehlte mir grip aber morgen habe ich 82 runden zeit weiter nach vorn zu kommen
9193634 durch die vielen unterbrechungen war es ein schwieriges qualifying es war auf jeden fall mehr drin als platz 18 aber nach meinem ausrutscher kurz vor schluss ging leider nichts mehr
9193635 zwei c klassen in den top drei und drei in den top f nf paul hat dabei die pole um weniger als eine zehntel verfehlt insgesamt ist dies eine recht ordentliche basis f r morgen garys leistung nach dem ausrutscher im ersten teil des qualifyings mit der 2007er c klasse noch auf platz acht zu fahren war speziell danke an alle fahrer und unsere teams durch den gewichtsunterschied von zehn kilo gegen ber den 2008er autos der konkurrenz haben sie sich nicht gro bremsen lassen es wird ein langes und forderndes rennen morgen und bei dem angek ndigten regen und gewitter mit wohl ganz anderen voraussetzungen als heute

9193723 had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions
9193724 as the head of alaskas national guard and as the mother of a soldier herself
9193725 gov palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
9193726 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and washington second
9193727 moodys gave a tentative pass to the biggest bond insurer
9193728 from my experience there is evidence of this from lehman brothers washington mutual and potentially indymac bank as well i am fairly sure that there are surprises to be had from all three of these banks as well in the upcoming quarters big surprises
9193729 above average will not venture an inane immaterial or dumb reply this is a compliment of the highest order
9193730 i am committed to the intermediate view of a continued declining financial stock environment
9193731 each graphic has a set of links to my opinion and the date the opinion was originally issued as well as a comparison to the broad market index s amp p 500 to see if any true alpha could have been generated on the short side
9193732 in 2006 sarah palin became alaskas youngest and first woman governor after having earned a reputation as a determined and successful advocate of ethics reform in politics in the primary she defeated an incumbent republican governor and then a former two term democratic governor
9193733 distanced herself from the old guard powerful members of the state gop and stood up to the oil interests that hold great power in alaska and with bipartisan support in the statehouse she won a tax increase on the oil companies profits
9193734 because of palins reputation as a maverick and her initial reduction of state spending including pork barrel spending life affirming palin connects with voters and has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential running mate for john mccain
9193735 mccain has reached for the stars and grabbed one on a recent cruise to alaska i had the pleasure of spending an afternoon with sarah palin she is brilliant and articulate and in alaska politics is a breath of fresh air as an alternative to their corruption epitomized by alaska republican senator ted stevens now obama who has spent two years preventing a woman from being president will spend two months preventing one from becoming vice president and hopes to do so with women votes the entire premise of the democratic convention was the fungibility of bush and mccain now mccain has vividly demonstrated the difference sarah palin is no dick cheney
9193736 i will wait patiently probably forever for all the conservaties who argued that obama was too inexperienced to be president to say the same thing about palin
9193737 i will wait patiently probably forever for all the conservaties who argued that obama was too inexperienced to be president to say the same thing about palin something tells me they wont though
9193738 so here is your choice hillary supporters vote for a candidate who beat yours fair and square or because i know you are just cynical femonazis vote for me and ill airlift a woman in to be my sidekick
9193739 people will have to choose which of americas sins are greater and which stain will have to be removed first is misogyny worse than racism or is racism worse than misogyny
9193740 1 steps on the story of obamas speech and convention and possibly the bounce coming from them and wipes them off the news cycle the sunday news shows will be all palin all of the time
9193741 blah blah blah have suddenly started turning those weapons on eachother inside the big tent of the democratic party blah blah blah
9193742 because she isnt standing for president dipshit also because she has plenty of experience with five years of executive government before obama even entered the senate
9193743 palin has been at it since 1992 shes running for vp with a presidential candidate who waved noah off on his first rafting trip
9193744 i dont know why i bother to respond to the likes of redbaiter and his sidekick murray but here goes
9193745 in general the person chosen to be the running mate normally is someone qualified to be president if the actual president should die ie kennedy or resign ie nixon
9193746 froth all you like but please at least dont lie
9193747 redbaiter believes is fit for the office because she can fly a plane
9193748 redbaiter powell has repeatedly and sternly denied that he will endorse obama where did you see it reported that rice was considering it
9193749 just someone in his neighbourhood that he doesnt associate with
9193750 so whats obama going to do if joe biden dies or doesnt that logic fit with your dull and shallow attempts to malign the republicans you simpleton
9193751 i said she had five years of executive government experience as a councillor and later mayor of wasilla city prior to obama entering the senate
9193752 also a record number of black people in florida will be disenfranchised for having similar names to convicted felons and a record number of voting machines will turn out weird results yeah i know im gonna get negative karma for this i just like to keep the conspiracy theories fair and balanced
9193753 now ill take sarah palin cutting property taxes in wasilla ak dealing to the corruption in the ak gop and the oil and gas commission and governing ak with the highest gubernatorial approval rating in america over barack obamas community activism with the corrupt acorn convicted of frequent voter fraud in multiple states and on a failed socialist foundation with radical marxist terrorists as fellow board members any day of the week
9193754 from a pissant backwater island at the bottom of the world
9193755 if redbaiter isnt the angriest man in the nz blogosphere i dont know who is
9193756 palin was mayor of a town of 9 000 people
9193757 all the people who said obama was unqualified and inexperienced are defending palins inexperience
9193758 can anyone seriously imagine this woman being commander in chief
9193759 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know

9193778 put this in the mtv news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
9193779 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9193780 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
9193781 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics

9193851 is eric bischoff going to start a new wrestling promotion using cmt as his network i dont know the answer but bischoff is an aggressive entrepreneur who understands the art of the deal being successful in this genre is all about talent and television and there unfortunately is no abundance of available talent out there that could headline a weekly tv show producing a slick looking show is less challenging than creating a viable talent roster in todays marketplace however i will add that if anyone could pull this off it would be bischoff
9193852 this pairing is disturbing to me as the 44 year old shamrock doesnt need to be in the ring any longer after being such a warrior all these many years kenny is a bona fide tough guy as most who have followed his career can attest i saw ken a few months ago in albany new york i had the chance to visit with him and i came away from the conversation feeling that ken needed to stop fighting and stick to training fighters
9193853 the brock lesnar vs cheick kongo mma fight has yet to be finalized for november has anyone heard of lesnar signing a new ufc deal as i read where brock had originally signed a three fight deal with the company by my last count that would leave only one fight left on this contract and the last thing the ufc needs is for lesnar to be a free agent which they obviously wont allow to happen if at all possible btw unless kongo can catch brock early lesnar should dominate this fight

9193859 since launching the acura american le mans series program in 2007 our goal has always been to compete at the highest level of sports car racing
9193860 the lmp1 class of the american le mans series represents the pinnacle of sports car racing in this country from both a competitive and technological standpoint as we prepare to elevate acura to tier one status among luxury road cars we feel it only appropriate to make this move to the uppermost level of american le mans series competition as well
9193861 this is the logical next step in our business plan
9193862 the acura sports car program has energized hpds associates and met numerous objectives during its first two seasons of american le mans series competition we feel we are fully prepared to take on this new challenge
9193863 i am delighted with our teams relationship with acura and my longstanding involvement with honda
9193864 and we have taken another important step with this new announcement we are a young team but de ferran motorsports has a great depth of experience and talent within its ranks we are driven to produce a contending acura motorsports sports car program we look forward to the challenge competing in the lmp1 class and putting acura at the forefront of american le mans series racing
9193865 our relationship with acura and hpd has been extremely beneficial to highcroft racing and we are proud to have been chosen as a part of acuras new lmp1 program in 2009
9193866 we have had a very collaborative effort with acura hpd and wirth research over the past two seasons we started with a good business plan and have been competitive throughout our alms program adding patr n as our major sponsor strengthened our acura program and we have had a very successful 2008 campaign now moving to the lmp1 class we expect to continue the progress that we began two years ago the 2009 season will be exciting for acura and the patr n highcroft racing team
9193867 we have had an outstanding sports car program with acura the last two years
9193868 we started with the lola chassis and the move to the acura car was a great improvement for our lowes fernandez team now we will concentrate on racing for the lmp2 point championship as well as winning many races our luck hasnt been with us as much as we would like but our association with acura has been outstanding and we are pleased to be continuing our relationship we want to be right in the thick of the lmp2 title chase in 2009

9193973 uno trata de ser lo m s realista posible en lo cotidiano de los adolescentes y no en lo oscuro es decir no son programas que tratan sobre la droga y el alcohol intentamos entretener
9193974 uno busca escapar de una realidad que vive todo los d as y que a veces es muy dura para muchos mirar televisi n es una manera de evadirse un poquito
9193975 en publicidad se usa el concepto de lo aspiracional es decir mostrar aquello a lo que uno no pertenece pero que desea la degradaci n de la clase media hace que la tv se rija por este t rmino
9193976 los programas de ahora son productos disfrazados de ficci n que tienen un objetivo la comercializaci n el merchandising el teatro el disco
9193977 no son espacios de reflexi n ni tienen contenidos dram ticos son contenidos pensados por un productor esta es mi humilde opini n
9193978 los protagonistas est n en un colegio de clase alta y conviven con chicos que tienen prejuicios sobre ellos y que los segregan pero esto tiene que ver con que la ficci n necesita de estos opuestos
9193979 en las ficciones para adolescentes de los 80 y los 90 se contaban los ritos de iniciaci n vinculados al amor y a la sexualidad la salida laboral los proyectos futuros y el reencuentro con amigos de la infancia en cambio ahora los personajes no tienen individualidad s lo retratan grupos que se oponen entre s con una tem tica discriminatoria
9193980 este tipo de programas transita por una l nea sensacionalista para generar un impacto revulsivo y horroroso en el espectador adem s cumple una funci n aleccionadora es decir muestra lo que no hay que hacer

9194087 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9194088 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9194089 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9194090 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9194091 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9194092 to insist harper take immediate action to put inspectors on the floor of meat processing plants
9194093 to very quickly restore the confidence of canadians and more importantly to protect canadians
9194094 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9194095 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9194096 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9194097 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9194098 this is prompted by the fact that one in four children in british columbia is either overweight or obese
9194099 we actually know that children who are healthy actually learn better
9194100 we really hope the physical break is about how the teachers shape their classes
9194101 weve created a series of guidelines that actually outline the types of products that can be in a vending machine
9194102 it doesnt mean that a student couldnt have pizza its just a matter of whats on that pizza
9194103 absolutely teachers are behind that but that revenue was funding sports teams special events and in some cases text books and basic supplies
9194104 you cant add p e in schools without adding space for that and resources for that
9194105 we dont have the gym space in vancouver it rains a lot and you cant have kids out there on the field in the pouring rain and in many parts of the province its very cold in the winter
9194106 fundamentally you need to have classrooms that are going to be as effective as possible
9194107 we continue to struggle to convince the government to address resources there
9194108 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity

9194114 there is a clear pattern emerging where vendors are hesitating to list their properties for sale unless they have to open homes are very slow of late indicating that either the time of year winter traditionally slow the coming elections or the economy is putting many would be buyers off some will still be waiting to see how much further prices will fall the result of this is that many salespeople are not earning a living and 700 have left real estate in auckland over the last few months you can bet there are more to follow
9194115 some vendors are still reluctant to meet the market in terms of price expectations but thats probably just an issue of time vendors who need to sell within a reasonable timeframe need to be realistic about what the market will bear at this time
9194116 the prices of houses seem to have reached a plateau and there is reasonable expectancy that prices will decline
9194117 of these several were from homes for sale with photos of their lounges displayed on billboards outside

9194127 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
9194128 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
9194129 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter

9194162 we are hopeful that this normalcy could be achieved within next week to 10 days
9194163 well may not be june but i mean signs of normalcy in the sense what you can
9194164 certainly we are unhappy about it but the situation is nowhere close to what it was in the 1990s
9194165 it was the blockade of the jammu srinagar national highway that created confusion we are trying to reduce agitation in jammu
9194166 i am on record on saying that we would like to know who did the shooting it wasnt done by the police
9194167 this is the concern even amongst the hurriyat and others saying that who is now amongst us who is trying to eliminate some of us
9194168 youll know at the right time when we are sure of who it is or which group was responsible
9194169 no we have no facts at the moment about a or b or c what we are clear at the moment is this was not the police
9194170 he aziz is not the martyr to the cause he has been made out to be he was shot in the back it was certainly not the police
9194171 the fight is definitely happening and im really glad i am already training very hard and im 100 percent certain that it will not go the distance i dont care if it is going to be by knockout or by submission i dont want the fight to go to a judges decision i want to finish mirko cro cop

9194174 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9194175 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9194176 i dont regret anything you make mistakes i just acknowledge them the beefs that i had back in the day were beefs that i had i understand them i know them and i did what i did no apologies no regrets
9194177 for the future ill just try to be a little bit more wiser i was young and wild then
9194178 i know that person and can go back to that person if need be but im focused right now im on another level with my lyrical growth and my mind is free
9194179 i got spaces in my head for other things outside of drama and bullshit
9194180 i came up with it one night in the studio and i didnt know if i could pull it off
9194181 i knew i had pac and the story of easy that was sorta me being that i grew up and i come from the n w a cloth the biggie was tough to pull off but as i rolled through the middle of the verse it started to become fun and easy it made for a dope song a dope concept
9194182 its not like i dont talk to dre i talk to dre every now and then
9194183 i am very proud to have been able to put this project together and i believe this new enterprise will bring a lot of excitement and glory to our country it is a unique situation to be able to take on these two roles i believe it is a great asset for me not just to be the driver but to also have a real involvement within the team structure i am really looking forward to racing for my country in the new a1gp powered by ferrari car
9194184 linking a1gps unique race format being the world cup of motorsport with monacos heritage in motor racing is a thrilling opportunity i am looking forward to making this partnership successful both with clivio and monegasque supporters as well as with a1gp
9194185 the new aero package helps driving through the high speed sections of the track even quicker the carbon brakes work extremely well meaning you can brake a lot later than you ever could before
9194186 its much more like a thoroughbred racing car overall the performance is a step up in every department i thoroughly enjoyed driving the car
9194187 the extra 60bhp you get with the push to pass will open up more overtaking opportunities at every circuit a1gp visits this season which should make racing even more exciting
9194188 the test was very encouraging and both test drivers gave very useful feedback
9194189 the brakes have much much better performance the engine is stronger and it is more powerful and has more torque
9194190 with this we have now covered 6100 kilometers approximately 3700 miles testing with the first test car and 581 kilometers 350 miles with the second
9194191 i thought i heard the voice of god telling me to go save brian i felt if i didnt get to brian he would die

9194193 without any introductions the large professor automatically starts freestyling to my beat
9194194 im like aw man i just got dubbed from the great one
9194195 the entire album is about the power of the punan if you will
9194196 the album follows the story line of my man adam who passed away and basically how he died it all started off with him catching a boner one morning morning wood and his life starts to spin out of control from there
9194197 him and i were best friends so hes kinda been there almost every step of the way so just me playing him the album he was diggin it a lot he liked it a lot
9194198 he definitely brought something to the table as far as the story line is concerned
9194199 he actually helped me rewrite the story trim the fat off the album and then he gave the story a brand new twist ending that was so genius
9194200 they all have two things in common one theyre all my friends and two theyre all like super dope at what they do

9194209 its worth adding that the reason shes adored in alaska is that she fought her own partys corruption

9194223 mister greene certe parti del suo romanzo non possono non offendere alcuni cattolici ma lei non dovrebbe attribuire alcuna importanza a questo
9194224 lopera di greene altro non che un commento alla parola divina non giudicate non giudicate il mondo che vi sembra abbandonato da dio esso abitato da dio non giudicate lumanit che in apparenza ha ucciso dio essa salvata da dio non giudicate la sconfitta di dio calpestato nelle sue istituzioni che vengono abbandonate al demonio deriso nella debolezza dei sacramenti la potenza e la gloria di dio vi sono presenti

9194226 non era che lennesima resa gli anni alle sue spalle erano disseminati di analoghe capitolazioni la sua vita quotidiana si era riempita di crepe come una piaga e la dimenticanza si infiltrava nelle fessure spazzando via questo e quellaltro
9194227 era per quel mondo che cristo era morto quanto pi male si vedeva e si sentiva in giro tanto pi grande era la gloria circonfusa attorno alla sua morte troppo facile morire per le cose buone o belle per la patria i figli la civilt ma ci voleva un dio per morire per gli indifferenti e i corrotti
9194228 anche se tutti i preti fossero come me ubriaconi vigliacchi avidi questo non cambierebbe nulla perch essi potranno sempre dare dio agli uomini
9194229 provava solo unimmensa delusione di doversi presentare a dio a mani vuote senza unopera da offrire gli pareva in quel momento che sarebbe stato cos facile essere un santo sarebbero bastati un po di autodisciplina e un po di coraggio si sentiva come chi per pochi secondi avesse mancato lappuntamento con la felicit adesso sapeva che alla fine una sola cosa conta veramente essere santi
9194230 mia could not verify all information available and the actual number of both russian military equipment and personnel on the ground may be much higher
9194231 parlando io un giorno con un padre maestro domenicano che mi fu detto esser molto dotto mi fece un elogio grandissimo del libro dei doveri delle figlie del s c egli non la conosceva personalmente ma da suoi scritti conobbe quanto valea fra le altre cose mi disse veramente ammirabile che in un secolo ove gli uomini colla loro falsa filosofia procurano di annientare la nostra santa religione una donna con quel suo libro abbia avuto il coraggio dinsegnare la vera filosofia cristiana che confusione per quei superbi
9194232 levarsi e gettare quasi sola e primiera il guanto della disfida al poter civile quando gli altri religiosi instituti e la maggior parte de prelati e degli ordinarii si incurvavano cos rassegnati alla servit da non mostrare quasi di accorgersi del peso della catena che gli aggravava
9194233 era la prima volta che mons carpani udiva rivolgersi un linguaggio cotanto franco e che gli richiamava in cuore le leggi della chiesa e disse veramente gran donna quella verzeri
9194234 sarebbe a formarsi un capitolo apposito intorno al di lei talento valore letterario e gusto fino nelle arti e nelle scienze da doverla riconoscere come un vero genio dellet e una gloria classica del suo sesso

9194236 davere in essa ammirato una vasta erudizione congiunta ad impareggiabile umilt
9194237 il distinto prelato quantunque ottimissimo disse in maniera non troppo delicata oh adesso tutte fondatrici io rimasi dispiaciuta e mortificata ma la sig ra teresa con virtuosa disinvoltura senza turbarsi si diport da edificarmi in modo da mai averlo potuto dimenticare
9194238 ci insegna quel che si debba fare da noi intanto per la vita della v da fondatrice
9194239 viene da roma un nostro parroco il quale ebbe udienza dal santo padre in compagnia di un sacerdote lodigiano lungo il colloquio cadde parola sulla benedetta fondatrice e il sac lodigiano r do pelli senza badare pi che tanto la disse venerabile verzeri il pontefice sorridendo disse non passate innanzi al papa voi non ancor venerabile si fatto un po di processo a bergamo ma qui non giunto ancor niente poi soggiunse s certo che io la stimo assai come donna che fu di singolari virt da essa continu da essa mi ebbi grande consolazione nel 1848 in quellepoca funesta erano intorno molti nemici del papa che preparavano quello che poi hanno fatto orbene quando io uscivo per la citt se la madre verzeri avesse veduta la mia carrozza io la vedea gettarsi per terra in qualunque luogo si trovasse e alla presenza di chiunque e starsi prostrata finch io era passato dio sa quanti dileggi le saranno toccati e quanti insulti avr avuto da quelli che lavranno veduta far onore al papa a quel modo in quei giorni funesti fin qui il santo padre come dichiara ed attesta questo buon parroco di averlo udito colle sue orecchie parlare al suddetto sacerdote lodigiano che ebbe ludienza in sua compagnia lepoca del 48 mi cagiona qualche dubbio poich non parmi che la fondatrice sia stata a roma in quellanno ad ogni modo questa circostanza solamente accessoria
9194240 la fond si era recata a roma nel 1847 e vi stette tutto il gennaio del 1848
9194241 il salvati mi disse la difficolt principale che ne implica molte versa sullo spirito della serva di dio spirito a quanto sembra satirico originale poco subordinato ecc ecc spirito giansanistico e via discorrendo
9194242 il salvatore ha dato ai sacerdoti e non alle donne la guida delle coscienze
9194243 accusata di resistenze pertinaci alle autorit ecclesiastiche anche de vescovi da altro de quali fu minacciata di scomuniche
9194244 accusata di giansenismo tanto essa che il fondatore accusata di giuseppinismo come stata in tutta ligia servente del governo austriaco
9194245 parlai dei ritratti e quadri dissi che mi pareva molto strana la pretesa di togliere di mano alla venerabile la penna della quale tanto si serv a sua ed altrui santificazione monsignore disse che quella pretesa poteva essere suggerita dal fatto che le principali animadversioni in questa causa di beatificazione si spiegavano sugli scritti della venerabile che per si era affatto liberi di rappresentarla come si credeva sarebbe bene conferissi la cosa collem inentissim o billio e seguissi il suo consiglio
9194246 raccontai pure allaliprandi le fisime che qu a taluni f patire la venerabile rappresentata con la penna in mano la testa eretta gli occhi aperti etc e che pei quadri da dispensare ci vuole altro atteggiamento ci sentendo gli prese la convulsione della tosse e ripeteva la parola puerilit ma anche su ci egli diceva di non fare questioni di non provocare risentimenti di fare come desiderano il che non mi piace il quadro non ha da rappresentare la fondatrice si ha da dipingere un generale nel campo di battaglia in atto di recitare con le mani giunte e cogli occhi chiusi il santo rosario
9194247 al santo officio fu sollevato sul libro un nuvolone di difficolt
9194248 my microphone went up my bum cheek so my bums all bruised i need someone to inspect my bum
9194249 i cant think of words ive crossed out so much im finding this so difficult
9194250 hes so lazy that boy i dont understand why everyone would go for him
9194251 if he wanted it so much he could have tried harder to get it
9194252 now weve given it to him he couldnt care less hes the worst head of house ever hes awful
9194253 in most poor jurisdictions there is a simple method of saving for old age have six kids they will have a few each and if you survive there will be lots of grandkids trained to respect their elders who will look after you
9194254 this does not work in china indeed if everyone has only one child there will potentially be four grandparents per grandchild you cant expect to get supported
9194255 in most developed countries people trust the system to look after them mutual funds are well developed there is often a social security savings net and a lot of people perhaps falsely expect to sell their house and live in clover
9194256 but in china you cant trust that either so you save and save and save
9194257 chinese families save because they have a gun at their head they save an amount that is almost incomprehensible by western standards
9194258 i am encouraging all citizens to start making plans to evacuate the city over the next couple of days
9194259 just bring in something that will set him off emotionally like his past with his mother
9194260 oh that devil comes to steal kill and destroy kids
9194261 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
9194262 is 95 percent to 98 7 percent the same as that of humans
9194263 the department of law advised me that this bill is unconstitutional given the recent court order mandating same sex benefits
9194264 with that in mind signing this bill would be in direct violation of my oath of office
9194265 the governors veto does not signal any change or modification to her disagreement with the action and order by the alaska supreme court it is the governors intention to work with the legislature and to give the people of alaska an opportunity to express their wishes and intentions whether these benefits should continue
9194266 we may disagree with the rationale behind the ruling but our responsibility is to proceed forward with the law and follow the constitution i disagree with the recent court decision because i feel as though alaskans spoke on this issue with its overwhelming support for a constitutional amendment in 1998 which defined marriage as between a man and woman but the supreme court has spoken and the state will abide
9194267 then what happened was the anti gay forces came up with what they called an advisory vote
9194268 it was essentially a way for anti lgbt people to try and rally public opinion to try and move their agenda forward
9194269 shes not out to judge anyone and has good friends who are gay
9194270 she spoke on radio programs all throughout the campaign saying i want a constitutional amendment i think these things are only for a man and a woman i dont think shes ever said a friendly word about gay people that they ought to have health benefits like other people do or anything along those lines
9194271 there is not a lot to speak of for aids policy because she hasnt done much
9194272 shes never been given the opportunity to address our situation here because it has never been put before her
9194273 she has done very little to address the major epidemics
9194274 she has that aura i think she will be mccains ace in the hole

9194495 el seleccionador cuenta conmigo y si termino en buen momento ir y de cara a la contrarreloj intentar ir a conseguir medalla
9194496 por enfrentarse a uno de los m s potentes de la competici n
9194497 le sobrar motivaci n para enfrentarse al valencia y por lo tanto habr que estar muy atentos y concentrados para pasar la eliminatoria
9194498 el f tbol portugu s como se ha demostrado los ltimos a os ha crecido de forma exponencial y el mar timo querr contribuir al buen momento por el que atraviesa su pa s
9194499 hay que tener el m ximo respeto han quedado quintos en una liga potente como la portuguesa deberemos hacer las cosas bien y lograr el pase a la liguilla
9194500 la mezcla de futbolistas brasile os y portugueses junto a alg n otro jugador extranjero
9194501 cuentan con hombres procedentes de grandes equipos como el oporto o el benfica
9194502 no estoy en mi mejor nivel ten stico pero s en el psicol gico
9194503 vale la pena hacer un esfuerzo final para acabar lo m s arriba
9194504 un partido as se define en pocos puntos y esos los jug tsonga mejor
9194505 for who spirulina represents an interesting food for various multiple reasons rich in iron and protein and is able to be administered to the children without any risk we at who consider it a very suitable food
9194506 con los que tengo estoy ya bien lo que m s me importa ahora es que la plantilla se quede en esos veintid s o veintitr s jugadores
9194507 es mi decisi n que no se quede en la plantilla acept el fichaje con la condici n de que ahora mismo no forme parte de la plantilla le he visto jugar y tiene condiciones pero ahora mismo hay jugadores suficientes
9194508 eso mismo le he explicado al jugador y espero que haya cambiado de opini n
9194509 ni me acuerdo de lo que pas en el bernabeu no me molesta que se hable de eso pero es un tema pasado
9194510 habr que intentar que el rival no pueda desarrollar sus mejores cualidades
9194511 quiero hacer un llamamiento a la afici n para que haya la m xima uni n con el equipo obviamente la responsabilidad la tenemos nosotros queremos ganar y que el p blico disfrute pero nos vendr a muy bien que se repitiese la qu mica que hubo en el encuentro contra el real madrid
9194512 vamos a ser muy exigentes con nosotros mismos queremos jugar del mismo modo en casa que fuera sabemos que hay aspectos mejorables a nivel general pero un equipo no se hace en dos meses
9194513 creo que se puede vender a todos los jugadores siempre que se den unas determinadas condiciones no me gusta personalizar en nadie pero creo que es importante para toda valencia tener al m ximo goleador de la eurocopa
9194514 siento mucho ver a un gran campe n como l no estar entre los diez primeros en valencia el pasado gran premio pero por lo que concierne a ferrari puede estar tranquilo
9194515 tenemos que trabajar para que encuentre las condiciones para salir m s adelante en estos nuevos circuitos
9194516 ver que pasa en el d a a d a
9194517 lo m s dif cil ha sido mantener la confianza en uno mismo pese a verte en el puesto 12 13 o en el ltimo como en el caso de los entrenamientos de brno ahora tenemos opciones de volver al podio pero ser muy dif cil porque nadie nos regalar nadie
9194518 quiz lorenzo no se hubiera ido de los primeros puestos quiz siempre hubiera estado ah
9194519 aunque reconozco que en laguna seca el error fue m o deb analizar mejor mis posibilidades quise aspirar a m s de lo que pod a
9194520 todo depender de si ellos son capaces de mantener su ritmo de entrenamientos
9194521 tiene experiencia y es inteligente lo suficiente como para ser campe n con cierta facilidad a menos que rompa el motor o se caiga
9194522 no hay ninguna otra explicaci n que dar y es un asunto estrictamente deportivo llevamos a los mejores que est n de forma y no tenemos en cuenta otros factores que no sean los futbol sticos
9194523 la relacci n de cada partido es de 18 jugadores y con esta lista cumplimos con todas las incidencias adem s hay una competici n paralela que es la de la sub 21
9194524 adem s entre un partido y otro podemos hacer convocatorias y citar a alguno de los integrantes de la selecci n sub 21
9194525 mi obligaci n es estar al tanto de todos los jugadores espa oles y de la actualidad del f tbol espa ol de la sub 21 y de todos aquellos que tengan el potencial de ayudarnos
9194526 ellos ya quedan en sus clubes e imagino que felices me preocupar a m s la inestabilidad que tendr an si no hubieran decidido su futuro
9194527 ayer no entren pero hoy lo hizo con toda normalidad y contamos con l como los 20 que hemos convocado
9194528 es muy bueno que espa a acuda a la champions con cuatro equipos nos gustar a que tengan m s jugadores espa oles pero es una realidad de los pa ses que nos rodea
9194529 los cuatro clubes representan al f tbol espa ol que el grupo sea f cil o dif cil es una situaci n a priori
9194530 no viv ninguna situaci n comprometida en el calder n reclamaban la presencia de luis aragon s y no me parece extra o
9194531 he ido a campos de mucha rivalidad con mi anterior club y en todos he sido tratado muy bien
9194532 lo m s dif cil ha sido mantener la confianza en m mismo
9194533 llevo un buen ritmo estoy bien f sicamente y mentalmente y creo que estoy en condiciones de aspirar a esa victoria que tanto me est costando
9194534 el a o pasado termin el 26 y fue el mejor de mi carrera y ste creo que aunque no jugara m s partidos acabar a entre el 15 y el 18 vale la pena hacer un esfuerzo lo que queda de este final de temporada para tratar de terminar lo m s arriba posible y si es posible en shanghai
9194535 nunca lo hab a visto jugar y pregunt un poco por ah me dijeron que de fondo no ten a ning n golpe que era normalito y ha entrado al partido y me ha hecho un ventilador
9194536 luego hablar con las personas que me lo han dicho y se lo dir
9194537 me ha sorprendido mucho el nivel con el que ha jugado desde dentro era un locura cuando no le apretaba y le hac a algo dif cil l me devolv a golpes ganadores no entend a como l estaba jugando tan bien el juego que ha tenido hoy no se corresponde con su r nking hab a momentos en los que ya no sab a qu hacer en la pista
9194538 me he sentido muy bien al principio el partido iba muy r pido y marat sacaba muy bien me restaba muy largo y se ha puesto un set arriba pero ganar el segundo al ser muy ajustado ha sido la clave y ganar el tercero definitivo los tres primero sets han sido muy intensos adem s con parones por la lluvia que hace que el partido sea m s duro mentalmente
9194539 ltimamente ven a jugando bien pero los resultados no acompa aban pero hoy creo que ha sido un partido muy completo y me voy contento porque cuando entrenas bien y los resultados no salen est s un poco fastidiado
9194540 ya ha disputado dos partidos oficiales ante el real madrid en la supercopa
9194541 sab a que iba a ser un partido complicado no me encuentro en mi mejor nivel ten stico pero s en mi mejor nivel psicol gico por ah me encontraba muy fuerte sab a que ten a que desplegar mi mejor tenis para ganar y as ha sido sobre todo en los dos primeros sets
9194542 en el tercero me entro un poco dolor en la mano y quer a cerrar pronto el set pero no puede hacer break hasta el 4 4 he jugado y sacado bastante bien adem s de restar muy bien de derecha
9194543 la molestia no me preocupa s que no hice rehabilitaci n de la mano sal de la operaci n y a la semana siguiente estaba compitiendo otra vez lo anormal era que no me doliera el m dico que lo tengo esta semana conmigo para ver la evoluci n me ha dicho que en el momento que estamos no hay ning n problema de que el tend n vuelva a sufrir ahora me tocar tratarme un poco y dar un poco de masaje y estar perfecta para la tercera ronda

9194554 oh yeah that sounds like a good idea more money for kids cool
9194555 un partido as de igualado depende de dos o tres puntos y el que los ganas se lleva el partido y l hoy los ha jugado mejor que yo
9194556 el se ha puesto a sacar bien y pese a todo he tenido oportunidades en todos los sets de irme adelante y a este nivel si no las aprovechas acabas perdiendo ha sido un partido igualado que pod a ir a un lado u otro pero en los puntos m s importantes l ha jugado mejor
9194557 ha habido un juego clave en el segundo set con tres iguales y 40 40 he tenido punto f cil para ganar y no he definido bien el ha ganado ese juego y se ha ido arriba definitivamente igualmente en el tercero tambi n he tenido varios puntos de break y no los he aprovechado

9194604 many businesses particularly those which sell a few items do not have many pages for the search engines to spider therefore a blog which is updated frequently will increase the number of pages the search engines can index and should bring more traffic to the site which will hopefully convert to sales a blog is also a great tool for communicating with customers as you can post the latest news about your product s and company
9194605 the advantage of a blog is its unique form of relationship and customer managed interactivity a blog allows customers to enter a relationship with you at their own pace gathering information as they go without feeling as if you are standing there waiting for them to make a choice when i come to your blog as a customer i can immediately begin to take in what you offer and how much youve made your business about me the appropriateness of the design the ease of navigation the usefulness of the content and the way you respond when i decide to interact all come together to help me decide whether youre the one i want to trust with my business the freedom to choose in my own time in my own way is a powerful thing a customer who decides to work with you based on what you offer on your blog and how you have responded to others there is a customer who already trusts what you do

9194655 why is it that people allow themselves to have emotional abundance spiritual abundance sometimes relationship abundance but cut it off in the area of financial its because a lot of us have negative neural associations that if we have money boy were being selfish money is no different from anything else in your life you deserve to have an abundance of it as much as you do an abundance of energy or an abundance of love or an abundance of contribution

9194670 if mccains entire argument so far has been that obama is too untested to be president then how can he pick a 44 year old first term governor of a state with 600 000 people with no foreign policy experience whatsoever

9194683 we know that palin will be ready for that 3 a m phone call shell already be up with her baby
9194684 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical the wires are showing
9194685 it sounds like a harriet miers decision lets find a woman whether shes experienced or not
9194686 as much as i loathe obama biden i cant in good conscience vote for a mccain palin ticket palin has absolutely no experience in foreign affairs
9194687 she just is not ready to be commander in chief
9194688 i am not even sure that the pick will have quite the galvanizing effect on conservatives that it seems to be having now as it sinks in the concerns ive mentioned here about her readiness and her credentials are the kind of thing that many conservative voters take seriously
9194689 if obama is an empty suit as mccain has suggested is palin suited for the oval office herself when mayor palins biggest annual worry is whether there will be enough snow for the iditarod dog mushing race

9194745 yesterdays wednesday comex experience was more or less a continuous erosion of substantial overnight gains the 5 90 day saw open interest rise 4 631 contracts or 14 4 tonnes apparently fresh selling came forward to meet demand

9194762 i am very happy about my team and my car because we did a lot of work yesterday to find a good set up and this morning the car was very fast
9194763 the car was great in qualifying but you not only need a good car you need to make sure you dont make a mistake it wasnt simple to ensure you didnt make an error in each of your one lap shootouts
9194764 there is a lot pressure to make sure you get it right the 15 minutes qualifying session is just the start then the battle begins
9194765 i am really happy for myself and sevilla fc because the car was strong and i did a good job

9194767 i think the qualifying format for superleague formula is unbelievable you only need to concentrate hard and you dont have to worry about traffic red or yellow flags or anything else just you and the car
9194768 it is really hard to find a clear lap in other categories but here you can really show what the car can do
9194769 i hope the car is strong tomorrow but we havent tried it yet on full tanks so it will be interesting to see how the car will react
9194770 we were struggling a bit this morning but we improved quite a lot as the day continued hopefully we can keep moving forward to aim to make the final shoot out next time
9194771 it was very competitive out there with a lot of extremely experienced drivers so i am happy to be third
9194772 im definitely delighted to be involved in the championship and weve seen a clear sign that this is going to be a big success for everyone
9194773 the format for qualifying is really exciting for both the drivers and the spectators
9194774 i was really happy to bounce back in my quarter final against ac milan i pushed a lot but made a mistake in the first sector but the rest of my lap was really good

9194841 we have thought of everything from a to z i and part of my aliya team will personally be escorting them to israel and we will remain with them until the moment they leave to their respective homes absorption centers kibbutzim and student housing
9194842 the pressure was getting to be too much to handle we had so much work that i had to ask for help i spoke to zeev bielski chairman of the jewish agency and within a few days help was making its way over
9194843 it is also good experience for them i like to surround myself with young energetic people
9194844 did you sort the cat issue out with el al
9194845 i find that this is a more meaningful way to make aliya we get to do everything together and besides i didnt want to deal with so much bureaucracy on my own
9194846 i was tired of dreaming i wanted to make it come true i also didnt want to work so hard for africa anymore i wanted to work hard for israel
9194847 theyve helped me so much id become more attached to the aliya center than to new york city or even johannesburg itself
9194848 olim should be treated as vips for giving so much to the country having everything arranged for them took a lot of work the system is not built in this way it is made for individual aliya but it was worth every moment
9194849 you dont even realize how bad it is because you get so used to being taken places and always being surrounded by people always guarded
9194850 while lebanon is proclaiming victory over the release of a vicious murderer
9194851 these olim are leaving everything behind and moving to israel this is the real victory aliya is victory for israel
9194852 just a few years ago aliya was considered something very private and rarely talked about to have it mentioned in a shul with such a big congregation is very significant
9194853 i came and changed all that there is nothing to hide here aliya should be talked about discussed considered why the shu shu
9194854 we wouldnt wait for them to come to us we would go to them
9194855 i love their enthusiasm its infectious i love that they are on the flight with us and that they will be with us for the first few days i think its great
9194856 here is a wonderful example of an exceptional aliya three generations are moving to israel to live their new lives
9194857 just watch they will walk all the way to israel
9194858 i served 80 000 people as mayor why shouldnt i serve you all tea
9194859 whats really amazing is that they keep asking us to call them when we need help

9195042 we decided to do the medieval theme again because last years street parade was washed out
9195043 all the effort put into designing medieval themed floats last year did not go to waste the weather is really making up for it this year

9195045 we really believe it was the most successful parade we have had

9195055 we went back to see if there were kids hiding in the bushes but we couldnt see anyone
9195056 we didnt report it to the police looking back now i think we should have
9195057 everyone has been lucky no one s been hurt but we were doing 80km h so it could have been worse
9195058 on our way home on saturday night august 2 between 11 30pm and 12am our car was hit by a large rock

9195065 with that amount of fires they will have been deliberately lit
9195066 police have been alerted and will be on the lookout for arsonists in the area
9195067 there is only one access road and with no water supply and poor visibility it can get quite dangerous fighting these kinds of fires
9195068 it is not an isolated incident fingal head has been a big problem there have been a number of fires there in the past in 2005 we had a very large series of fires out there
9195069 the fires did not threaten any houses but there were access issues for the fire crews
9195070 the nsw fire brigade and the rural fire service worked well together they worked really hard to get all the fires out so there was no threat of reigniting
9195071 we are hoping for fine weather all day with on stage entertainment scheduled till six at the stan sercombe oval after the parade
9195072 sideshow alley will keep running and therell be fireworks at eight
9195073 it is particularly dangerous for the driver oncoming cars and the person throwing the rock everyone in the vicinity
9195074 we are aware of it and we encourage people to contact their local police or the police assistance line
9195075 the plan for griffith street is that we leave it open for through traffic the same as we did this year but the street will still become very much a part of the event
9195076 the feedback from retailers has been that when griffith street was closed to traffic people were walking up the middle of the street and looking at the cars
9195077 by keeping the street open and having the pedestrians walk on the other side of the cars we are actually pushing them towards the shops the belief is it will be better for the retailers
9195078 it looks like it is going to be possible to put the street parade back on for 2009 which is fantastic
9195079 we are looking at going from north kirra to coolangatta this time which means it will go past kirra point and that is a very beautiful area
9195080 yes and the department of corrective services believes services will be improved
9195081 it was a very worthwhile program and the outcomes were positive
9195082 we are encouraging parents to keep their kids away from school when they are sick
9195083 it is too hard to learn when they are this bad i have been here 11 years and i can only remember one other occasion where it was this bad
9195084 a lot of the staff has also been affected by it as well we had 10 away last week
9195085 we had 17 kids away sick in a class last week and a third of the staff have also been affected
9195086 casuarina village will create a new hub for residents and visitors to the tweed coast providing much needed shopping and service facilities together with quality restaurants cafes and parkland
9195087 we have undertaken extensive consultation with both the local community and tweed shire council to get to this point and we plan to continue working with local people during the public exhibition period
9195088 the economic studies we completed when planning the development took into account commercial developments being built at casuarina and pottsville
9195089 we want our shopping offering to focus on the needs of locals and have designed the supermarket and commercial space accordingly
9195090 at the moment we are focused on sub division plans
9195091 as i have seen in my personal experience when you go out at night in the electorate it is not unusual to see children under the age of 15 wandering around in groups
9195092 so there is a real antisocial element across the shire and it is not getting any better
9195093 i would encourage citizens to take back the streets by reporting any suspicious activity to the police and i would encourage all parents to take an active interest in what their children are doing
9195094 if it is a hotspot i would also expect council to take action to limit those rocks in the general vicinity i mean you cant try and rid the entire shire of projectiles but it should be kept in focus to try and stamp the behaviour out
9195095 perch non creiamo una grande associazione lgbt libertaria antiautoritaria democratica
9195096 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come
9195097 the lightning are extremely pleased to have andrej under contract for the next 6 years andrej will be a very big part of our hockey club moving forward at 22 years of age he will only continue to improve and mature as a player nhl defensemen typically dont hit their prime until 25 26 years of age and we look forward to working with andrej throughout that time and beyond
9195098 im extremely happy to be heading to tampa bay and i cant wait to take advantage of this opportunity we should have a great team and i can not wait to get started

9195187 se ha dedicado a negar la crisis econ mica frente a las advertencias del pp y de todas las instituciones econ micas
9195188 tras reconocer la probabilidad de una recesi n las medidas adoptadas ante la crisis son claramente insuficientes e injustas
9195189 las personas con rentas m s bajas no se ver n beneficiadas
9195190 las medidas del psoe se deben m s a la improvisaci n que a una reflexi n coherente adem s de que todas las instituciones y agentes econ micos tambi n las han tachado de insuficientes

9195192 el drama de la inmigraci n irregular porque por culpa de la ausencia de iniciativas orientadas a evitar la continua entrada de mafias en las costas que trafican con personas el gobierno ha preferido mirar hacia otro lado

9195229 al tener patentada la marca de murcia la han tenido que retirar de las etiquetas
9195230 como las palabras queso cabra y al vino son gen ricas y no se pueden patentar ni proteger estas empresas siguen comercializando su producto a la sombra de nuestra denominaci n de origen como queso de cabra al vino
9195231 este producto no pasa los mismos controles que el verdadero queso de murcia al vino que es el que realmente ha cosechado el xito en distintos mercados
9195232 las empresas imitadoras no han respetado la iniciativa de desarrollo rural consistente en recuperar la elaboraci n artesana de nuestro queso al vino consiguiendo un producto de calidad y propiciando que lo que antes era una explotaci n ganadera marginal hoy tenga posibilidades de ser cada vez m s rentable
9195233 ha ganado muchas cotas de mercado debido a su calidad reconocida y sobre todo porque es un queso controlado por un consejo regulador

9195236 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9195237 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9195238 isnt it sexism for her to only acknowledge the fact that palin could break the ultimate glass ceiling
9195239 gov palin no rev wright no fr pfleger no terrorists no racists no criminals no resko how refreshing i will now vote for the republican party the first time in my life
9195240 palin a heartbeat away from the presidency now thats a scary prospect for someone running on the same ticket as 72 year old john mccain
9195241 does mccain really not recognize that he is 72 years old he will turn 77 during his first term
9195242 and yes i am pod that b o did not pick her as his running mate then had the nerve to ask her for her support
9195243 i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9195244 clarence thomas harriet meirs and sarah palin the republicans do this over and over pick a token candidate ad dare the opposition to complain
9195245 a part time vice president is unacceptable either governor palin will end up lacking in her obligations to fulfill motherhood duties or struggle in effort to carry out that which is expected of her as v p
9195246 obamas worst nightmare another woman tougher and more experienced than he is
9195247 dismissed the importance of equal pay saying that women simply need education and training
9195248 the vice president position comes with a great deal of responsibility equally important as the job of president a part time vice president is unacceptable either governor palin will end up lacking in her obligations to fulfill motherhood duties or struggle in effort to carry out that which is expected of her as v p this is not a small state like alaska
9195249 its the united states of america that cannot accept anything less than to have someone we trust to hold office
9195250 either governor palin will end up lacking in her obligations to fulfill motherhood duties or struggle in effort to carry out that which is expected of her as v p
9195251 there will be penty of time for hilliary to dig into palin will she rise to the task
9195252 obama supporters are so afraid of palin they have resorted to defending hillary
9195253 also while im sure sarah palin appreciates your gallant preemption of chauvinistic bullying my guess is she can defend herself just fine
9195254 during our convention we democrats laid out clear bold solutions to tackle the two biggest challenges confronting our nation economic disarray at home and a decline in american strength and support around the world
9195255 the contrasts between us and the republicans could not be starker especially on issues that matter to middle class families
9195256 with barack obama in the white house and democrats leading in congress we will lead the charge to revitalize the economy create jobs make college affordable again and enable hardworking americans to pay for gas food utilities and cover the monthly bills
9195257 democrats will continue to fight to lower gas prices as we are doing now in congress even as john mccain and the republicans side with big oil
9195258 i for one cant wait to watch president barack obama with the support of a democratic congress sign into law universal health care that covers every single american
9195259 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and hes promised tax breaks for the biggest corporations instead of middle class families and in 2008 he still thinks its ok that women arent earning equal pay for equal work
9195260 as hillary clinton aptly stated senator mccain has a lifetime of experience
9195261 der beste unter den menschen ist der der den anderen am n tzlichsten ist

9195302 i just tried sticking around and mixed up the paces a little bit
9195303 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9195304 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9195305 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9195306 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9195307 jeffs sort of the statesman of the deal and he really has good ideas
9195308 they race with him and they know he drives it sideways or whatever it takes he just drives the wheels off of it

9195310 i think im a better driver today than i was when i was 31 years old i have a passion for what i do i have a commitment to richard to be here for an extended period of time and hes committed to me to have me here it would take some very very odd circumstances for me to be somewhere else
9195311 this is where i want to be im very comfortable with where i am i love the intensity that we have this is where ill be
9195312 i am glad i know this now because i will really be able to give him some grief about being old

9195331 the first group to define her nationally whether its the republicans or democrats will likely establish a lasting image
9195332 her candidacy effectively reintroduces this set of social questions into the race
9195333 that said when republicans talk about character questions they tend to win elections when democrats talk about issues they tend to lose elections
9195334 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9195335 theyll be minor things but things could pick up in the next day or two

9195359 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9195360 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9195361 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9195362 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9195363 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9195364 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9195365 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9195366 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9195367 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9195368 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9195369 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9195370 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9195371 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9195372 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9195373 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9195374 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9195375 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9195376 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9195377 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9195378 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9195379 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9195380 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9195381 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9195382 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9195383 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9195384 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9195385 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9195386 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9195387 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9195388 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9195389 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9195390 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9195391 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9195392 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9195393 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9195394 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9195395 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9195396 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9195397 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9195398 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9195399 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9195400 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9195401 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9195402 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9195403 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9195404 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9195405 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9195406 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9195407 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9195408 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9195409 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9195410 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9195411 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9195412 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9195413 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9195414 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9195415 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9195416 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9195417 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9195418 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9195419 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9195420 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9195421 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9195422 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9195423 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9195424 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9195425 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9195426 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9195427 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9195428 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9195429 we must act urgently to improve our childrens performance in maths and encourage those with aptitude to go on to study it
9195430 literacy and numeracy in the primary years are crucially important to ensuring all students participate in education and make a positive transition to work and learning in adult life
9195431 students who do not achieve the minimum standards in literacy and numeracy are least likely to stay on through secondary school or to end up in further study and employment
9195432 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9195433 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9195434 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9195435 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9195436 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9195437 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9195438 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9195439 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9195440 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9195441 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9195442 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9195443 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9195444 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9195445 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9195446 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9195447 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9195448 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9195449 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9195450 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9195451 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9195452 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9195453 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9195454 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9195455 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9195456 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9195457 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9195458 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9195459 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9195460 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9195461 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9195462 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9195463 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9195464 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9195465 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9195466 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community

9195728 in my early years i assiduously followed this threefold course first i read through the entire bible three times a year eight chapters in the old testament and two in the new testament daily i steadily persevered in this for ten years in order to familiarize myself with its contents which can only be done by consecutive reading second i studied a portion of the bible each week concentrating for ten minutes or more each day on the same passage pondering the order of it the connection between each statement seeking a definition of the important terms in it looking up all the marginal references being on the look out for its typical significance third i meditated on one verse each day writing it out on a slip of paper in the morning memorizing it consulting it at odd moments through the day pondering separately each word in it asking god to open for me its spiritual meaning and to write it on my heart the verse was my food for that day meditation standing to reading as mastication does to eating the more some such method as the above be followed out the more shall we be able to say thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path ps 119 105

9195748 for the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods law indeed it cannot and those who are in the flesh cannot please god

9195759 in clapping both hands a sound is heard what is the sound of one hand
9195760 respond with increasing sensitivity to the divine presence in through and beyond everything that exists
9195761 this factual priority of solitude is i believe a sound element in monastic asceticism locked into interaction with the human beings that make up our fallen world it is all but impossible to grow in grace as one should
9195762 as we have indicated there are many other activities that could for the right person and upon the right occasion be counted as spiritual disciplines in the strict sense stated of our previous chapter the walk with christ certainly is one that leaves room for and even calls for individual creativity and an experimental attitude in such matters
9195763 here it is matter of taking pains about taking pains it is in fact a variety of self obsession narcissism a thing farthest removed from the worship and service of god

9195776 mankinds common instinct for reality has always held the world to be essentially a theater for heroism
9195777 first and foremost a reflex of the terror of death
9195778 a considerable portion of ones life energy is consumed in the denial of death
9195779 was that there was no essence that the essence of man is really his paradoxical nature the fact that he is half animal and half symbolic
9195780 everything that man does in his symbolic world is an attempt to deny and overcome his grotesque fate he literally drives himself into a blind obliviousness with social games psychological tricks personal preoccupations so far removed from the reality of his situation that they are forms of madness
9195781 it makes routine automatic secure self confident activity impossible it places a trembling animal at the mercy of the entire cosmos and the problem of the meaning of it
9195782 men are so necessarily mad that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness
9195783 what we might call the costs of pretending not to be mad
9195784 it all boils down to a simple lack of strength to bear the superlative to open oneself up to the totality of experience
9195785 the strong individual of the later middle ages could not be satisfied with the peaceful but passive conception of requies he split into two parts a body that experienced pleasure or pain and an immortal soul that was released by death
9195786 but if im not part of mom what am i part of
9195787 dominates the whole of each persons relation to his human environment
9195788 a child who distorts the world to relieve his helplessness and fears who sees things as he wishes them to be for his own safety
9195789 mirabile the transference object being endowed with the transcendent powers of the universe now has in himself the power to control order and combat them
9195790 the more they have the more rubs off on us we participate in their immortality and so we create immortals
9195791 each society elevates and rewards leaders who are talented at giving the masses heroic victory expiation for guilt relief of personal conflicts
9195792 who embrace the ongoing system of death denial with the heartiest hug the hottest tears the least critical distance
9195793 self taught attempts on the patients part to cure himself
9195794 projection is a necessary unburdening of the individual man cannot live closed in upon himself and for himself
9195795 all of us are driven to be supported in a self forgetful way ignorant of what energies we really draw on of the kind of lie we have fashioned in order to live securely and serenely
9195796 since anxiety is the egos incapacity to accept death the sexual organizations were perhaps constructed by the ego in its flight from death and could be abolished by an ego strong enough to die
9195797 he refuses the loan life in order thus to avoid paying the debt death
9195798 the irony of mans condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation but it is life itself which awakens it and so we must shrink from being fully alive
9195799 the ultimate problem is not guilt but the incapacity to live the illusion of guilt is necessary for an animal that cannot enjoy life in order to organize a life of nonenjoyment
9195800 whoever rightly understands and celebrates death at the same time magnifies life
9195801 the sense of death henceforth diluted and distributed over the whole of life and thus lost its intensity
9195802 it is a curious and seemingly paradoxical fact that life ceased to be so desirable at the same time that death ceased to seem so punctual or so powerful
9195803 neither this world nor the other nor coming going or standing neither death nor birth nor sense objects are to be found
9195804 not created not annihilated not impure and not pure not increasing and not decreasing
9195805 since i abruptly realized the unborn i have had no reason for joy or sorrow at any honor or disgrace
9195806 when you dwell in the unborn itself youre dwelling at the very wellhead of buddhas and patriarchs
9195807 since i was born and will die i must exist
9195808 die before you die so that when you come to die you will not have to die
9195809 graduates from the school of possibility he knows better than a child knows his abcs that he can demand absolutely nothing of life and that the terrible perdition and annihilation live next door to every man
9195810 he who sank in possibility sank absolutely but then in turn he emerged from the depth of the abyss lighter than all the troublesome and terrible things in life
9195811 because the anxiety within him has already fashioned fate and has taken away from him absolutely all that any fate could take away
9195812 the most horrible of all evils death is nothing to us for when we exist death is not present but when death is present then we are not
9195813 time is generated by the minds restlessness its stretching out to the future its projects and its negation of the present state
9195814 the now is not pregnant with the not yet now but the present arises from the future in the primordial ecstatical unity of the temporalizing of temporality
9195815 we admire most the courage to face death we give such valor our highest and most constant adoration it moves us deeply in our hearts because we have doubts about how brave we ourselves would be
9195816 became and long remained schizophrenic in order to avoid facing the fact that life is finite
9195817 there will come a time when you must forget all that you have learnt
9195818 men are afraid to forget their minds fearing to fall through the void with nothing to stay their fall they do not know that the void is not really void but the realm of the real dharma

9195861 i think hillary made a great speech to bring unity to the party and i was very pleased to hear barack obama talk about clean coal technology i hope he will bring his campaign to our area to talk more about the clean coal technology policy he has in mind
9195862 absolutely yes i support obama you know it really wasnt hard for me to make that transition because i believe it is so very important to elect a president who will work for the people and for a brighter future for our country

9195920 penso que toda a equipa jogou muito bem tanto os jogadores que entraram de in cio como os suplentes utilizados todos trabalharam bem durante a partida e essa foi a chave para o nosso sucesso

9195926 we strongly recommend to the public that they wash their hands frequently particularly after using the bathroom changing diapers and preparing food persons who are sick with diarrhea should not be involved in food preparation
9195927 take the time to clean hands and food preparation surfaces frequently keep raw meats separate from ready to eat foods cook foods to proper temperatures and refrigerate leftover foods quickly
9195928 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9195929 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9195930 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs

9195932 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent

9195936 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9195937 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9195938 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9195939 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9195940 were supposed to be a world class company but they dont want to give us a world class contract

9195946 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive

9195952 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
9195953 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
9195954 surrounding myself around the right people and staying out of gentlemens clubs having a great relationship with god and spending more time with my family
9195955 were certainly gratified that adam jones is going to be with us
9195956 we planned that way but it always could have been different were glad to have him and we think hell do a good job for us
9195957 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
9195958 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future

9195961 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
9195962 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
9195963 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
9195964 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling

9195966 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products

9195976 to really still be in the conversation in terms of music sales decades after your career started is the exception not the norm
9195977 it is hard to imagine any album ever dominating the conversation as much as thriller did
9195978 we are anxious and waiting for him to do something

9196000 we aim to go through the major cities of the east coast

9196003 hopefully it will be quiet the rest of the weekend
9196004 i am very disappointed in the united nations because they have not talked to this headquarters before they made that release
9196005 i share his concern about civilian casualties but what i believe is that we have to work together to find out what the facts are before we make public announcements
9196006 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened

9196008 our annual inspections that go above and beyond federal requirements confirm the bay bridge is safe
9196009 you have five lanes and hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money spent and there are just non stop repairs

9196013 they dont feel the traffic and how it holds people up
9196014 ocean city has a huge economic impact on the whole state of maryland you would think that the state would not want to interfere with commerce going on that weekend
9196015 were hoping people still come because the weather has been gorgeous down here and its been a fabulous summer
9196016 if the engineers think this work needs to be done then we need to do it
9196017 it would be irresponsible of us not to do it as quickly as possible
9196018 rising gas prices leading edge technology and the push for work life flexibility have all come together in the past twelve months to create a pretty dramatic increase in telework across the u s and canada

9196023 yes absolutely theres no question that the bridge is structurally sound
9196024 this this is something thats not detectable through normal inspection procedures and its something that has occurred slowly over time
9196025 they inspected the bolts that hold the parapet walls in place and they were structurally sound
9196026 is a direct result of voids in the center of the concrete parapet where moisture has become trapped

9196063 i normally see the ball well hes a good pitcher hopefully i can keep that up well see what happens
9196064 we never really had another opportunity he pitched really really well
9196065 i didnt get down on myself after the first inning
9196066 i put it behind me and didnt let it get me down
9196067 but at some point our pitchers have to understand that a good outing is a win you can lose a game in the first inning we have to change the mentality that someone threw well but lost 4 3 10 5 or whatever

9196102 ova oluja ima potencijal da postane vrlo opasna vjetar je jednostavo strahovit
9196103 it was very clear from the beginning that we did not want to make some kind of cause documentary thats a genre like everything is going to be okay and here are the heroes
9196104 they msf doctors dont view themselves like that they are humans they are doing quite extraordinary stuff in crazy situations but it would be disingenuous to the actual reality of the situation to turn it into one of those standard cliches
9196105 this is low grade medicine the things that we do are not as good as they could be
9196106 i was completely burnt out dreaming about burned bodies and dying people i had trouble in my personal life maintaining my relationships i was becoming aggressive
9196107 if the law is passed by september 9 or 10 we can hold the elections on december 22 if its later than that we will try for december 31
9196108 he is feeling better today he started fasting from this morning 7 a m and he will continue till evening the doctors say that there is nothing to worry about

9196110 put concerted non violent efforts to bring a natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet
9196111 this is a very solemn moment for all the tibetans
9196112 this is a time to reflect on how we did this year for freedom and a moment to pause and think for ourselves in these trying times of our history
9196113 look i dont know if shes a game changer but she is certainly a good strategic chess move
9196114 she changes the image of the republican party from purely white male to more diverse and thats good for the party in a year in which the democrats have the first african american nominee
9196115 gov palins story is one that all americans will find inspiring shes a washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger
9196116 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9196117 but one of the fascinating things is what it may tell us about john mccain we now know if we didnt before that john mccain is a gambler this is high stakes this is rolling the dice and thats very interesting
9196118 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9196119 the presence of arab forces on the ground can help in preventing the fighting and stopping the israeli palestinian conflict
9196120 the matter has not been studied yet but it is an attractive idea that deserves to be taken seriously when we consider that egypt and the arab league may play a role in this matter
9196121 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9196122 its a strategically brilliant development for mccain he desperately needed to woo evangelical voters
9196123 no republican has captured the white house in modern history without their support
9196124 governor palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives she has a record of advancing the culture of life at every opportunity
9196125 senator mccain made an outstanding pick shes solid on all the core social issues
9196126 i have five kids too and i think it is exciting when you see someone who is working actively to make her family a part of her mission
9196127 and her decision to have her child when she knew he had downs syndrome is a beautiful beautiful story
9196128 the oil companies have been hugely influential in alaska certainly over the last decade and a half with the prior two administrations for alaskans as owners of the resource it is time to embrace our sovereignty

9196132 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm so we strongly encourage the residents to follow the instructions of the local emergency management officials and be prepared to evacuate
9196133 we are better able to respond to an oil disruption scenario than we ever have before
9196134 an autumn evening soft and mild with a wind that sighs mournfully

9196145 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9196146 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that governor palin is not qualified to be vice president she has a record of accomplishment that senator obama simply cannot match
9196147 obviously a terrific story personal story im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9196148 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle

9196261 12 principles for surviving and thriving at work home and school
9196262 repeated exposure to information in specifically timed intervals provides the most powerful way to fix memory in the brain
9196263 extra information given at the moment of learning makes learning better
9196264 vision is probably the best single tool we have for learning anything
9196265 pictorial information is superior in capturing attention independent of its size

9196268 certain types of learning wither in the face of traumatic stress
9196269 emotional arousing events tend to be better remembered than neutral events
9196270 emotionally charged events persist much longer in our memories and are recalled with greater accuracy than neutral memories
9196271 what we pay attention to is often profoundly influenced by memory
9196272 in everyday life we use previous experience to predict where we should pay attention
9196273 the unusual unpredictable or distinctive are powerful ways to harness attention in the service of interest
9196274 the more attention the brain pays to a given stimulus the more elaborately the information will be encoded and retained
9196275 the brain cannot multitask multitasking when it comes to paying attention is a myth the brain naturally focuses on concepts sequentially one at a time
9196276 research shows that we cannot multitask we are biologically incapable of processing attention rich inputs simultaneously
9196277 our heads tend to be filled with generalized pictures of concepts or events not with slowly fading minutiae

9196355 alcuni paesi arabi soprattutto dopo alcune nostre dichiarazioni sulle ingiustizie e sulloppressione perpetrate da alcuni regimi su quelle popolazioni come in algeria ed in egitto incominciarono a far pressioni a roma affinch fossero effettuare indagini e perquisizioni a nostro carico tutto questo naturalmente stato poi intensificato dall 11 settembre 2001

9196358 la kore scrive santo virga sta alzando notevolmente le tasse di iscrizionee di rinnovo a tutti gli studenti non solo a coloro che si iscrivono ex novo ma anche a coloro che sono gi iscritti
9196359 intanto c da sottolineare che 333 euro sono la quota delle tasse statali e regionali prima rata che non va alla kore dichiara il presidente salerno la retta continua ad essere di mille euro quindi di 1333 euro per i corsi di lingue straniere ad indirizzo europeo archeologia scienze della comunicazione scienze politiche internazionali scienze delleducazione dams e sociologia 1 222 euro pi i soliti 333 euro per la specialistica della giurisprudenza scienze investigative ingegneria ambientale e telematica lingue straniere ad indirizzo arabo e cinese economia aziendale e scienze motorie
9196360 tutte le lauree specialistiche che secondo il ministero delluniversit avrebbero dovuto pagare 2700 euro la quota annua invece disposta dalluniversit kore di 1583 prosegue cataldo salerno per quanto riguarda il corso di laurea di architettura ad indirizzo europeo quindi valida in tutta europa che a numero chiuso 120 posti il costo di 2166 euro comprese le solite 333 euro lo stesso costo per il corso di laurea in psicologia perch si tratta di un corso raddoppiato quindi due corpi docenti ma in compenso gli studenti che li frequentano non pagano tirocinio master che sono a carico delluniversit c da sottolineare che luniversit kore restituisce il 66 per cento agli alunni meritevoli che danno tutti gli esami dellanno percentuali minori a seconda del numero delle materie date in proporzione ai crediti nella sostanza gli alunni meritevoli possono benissimo studiare quasi gratis
9196361 altra cosa da sottolineare conclude cataldo salerno luniversit kore al secondo posto dopo la san raffaele di milano e prima de la luiss di roma per la regolarit degli studi sono cifre queste che provengono dal ministero delluniversit quindi quelle che ci sono in giro sono accuse strumentali che vogliono creare discreto ad una universit che lavora per gli studenti
9196362 la recente presa di posizione di cataldo salerno e del rettore and in merito alle polemiche sullaumento delle tasse alluniversit kore altamente chiarificatrice il ragionamento di costoro infatti si basa sullassunto espletato in pi passaggi che lateneo ennese a tutti gli effetti annoverabile tra le universit private e come tale deve muoversi allinterno di uno schema mercantile che non tiene e non pu tenere conto delle condizioni reali di reddito degli studenti e delle loro famiglie ma esclusivamente delle ragioni dellazienda kore il mercato bellezza ci particolarmente evidente nella spiegazione dellaumento delle tasse a psicologia quando i due sostengono che per calmierare le iscrizioni hanno dovuto aumentare le tasse in sostanza salerno e and portano avanti un ragionamento aberrante che farebbe rivoltare nella tomba non un pericoloso comunista ma una figura straordinaria del cattolicesimo italiano come don milani essi infatti prefigurano una universit daltri tempi quella in cui la selezione non avviene in base alla preparazione e alla voglia di apprendere ma viene decisa dai dirigenti dellazienda kore sulla base di fatto delle possibilit economiche una universit di classe dunque in cui il figlio delloperaio non potr mai aspirare ad entrare questo il modello universitario ennese spiegato da chi fino a pochi mesi fa non solo si trovava ad essere presidente della provincia sostenuto da una maggioranza di centrosinistra ma che addirittura si scagliava violentemente contro chiunque in primis rifondazione comunista affermasse che luniversit di enna fosse una struttura di gestione privatistica dei fondi pubblici che poi la selezione sulle concrete possibilit economiche produca un aumento del profitto degli studenti come vorrebbero farci credere salerno e and una idea assolutamente ridicola vorrei ricordare che in italia vi sono diverse universit private che hanno ormai assunto la vocazione di veri e propri laureifici in cui paghi tanto per ottenere un pezzo di carta di poco valore formativo ma comunque in tempi brevi forse la kore di enna aspira a diventare il laureificio della sicilia centrale
9196363 la maggior parte delle universit fanno pagare agli studenti ulteriori servizi quali ad esempio il tirocinio i laboratori o i corsi di lingue che noi garantiamo a tutti gratuitamente laumento dei servizi che la kore fornisce da questanno e le nuove strutture a disposizione degli studenti hanno costi di gestione interamente a carico delluniversit che non percependo i contributi ministeriali al pari delle universit statali deve contare solo sulle proprie forze inoltre la programmazione economica delle tasse approvata dal ministero ci lascia pochi margini di manovra imponendoci di rispettare quanto stabilito

9196380 he is not a dishonest person but it is because he have too much unreasonable passion in the movie i werent willing to marry him i love wu zun i hurted him therefore he hitted my ear and the area around it before filming that scene he said that he wont really hit me i said that he could since we dont have a relations but he couldnt do it although palm seems to hit very hard and ruthless but when he hit me on the face it was not painful at all
9196381 we were very devoted when filming but because sometime it was too hot it effected our progress therefore we have a lot of catching up to do i cant not believe it that its actually done already it was a pity because it is very rare to get to kiss a dashing guy

9196847 we cannot claim to love god yet deny his word and channel of communication
9196848 we all need help to understand the bible and we cannot find the scriptural guidance we need outside the faithful and discreet slave organization
9196849 thus the bible is an organizational book and belongs to the christian congregation as an organization not to individuals regardless of how sincerely they may believe that they can interpret the bible

9196862 man was made a likeness and imitation of the word when the divine breath was breathed into his face
9196863 our great moses likened the fashion of the rea sonable soul to no created thing but averred it to be a genuine coinage of that dread spirit the divine and invisible one signed and impressed by the seal of god the stamp of which is the eternal word

9197000 putting which was one of the successes of tiger woods 08 is oddly broken to make the yardage you would expect you have to literally choose to hit the ball two or three times harder than required to make a 3ft putt on the level youd expect to select the 3ft putter and go for a 100 shot instead you need to pick the 6ft putter at 100

9197022 the plan had been to allow cross pollination but after looking into it a number of factors made me decide against it first drafting the right cross pollination chart for this many new plants would require a significant amount of time but assuming we had delayed publishing these additions to draft that chart we would then meet issue 2 art i actually took a stab at the chart but aside from a handful of the new plants there is no possible logical correlation between the existing plants and the new ones by no stretch of the imagination would combining an existing plant to one of the new seeds result in another one of the new plants in order to get that 5th generation new art would be required which isnt possible at the current time
9197023 this was a valid suggestion but the issue is the same many of the new plants have nothing in common with each other and no cross pollination chart would make sense i suspect this was one of the reasons they werent added in the first pass to begin with again this is a case of new art required
9197024 this was a design decision while the code is complex way more than just telling it new vs old it wouldnt take too much time to allow the plants to produce seeds however since these plants cannot cross pollinate or give resources if we allow them to produce seeds the market will be flooded with the most desirable plants within 3 to 4 weeks and in 2 months from now only a handful of people will bother with the plants anymore and definitely nobody will be hunting the seeds as everyone and their brother will have tons in store already by limiting their availability and randomizing the drop of the seeds it will make the most desirable plants rarer and thus more valuable while also expanding the life span of this mini game
9197025 from the start the interest in the bonsai because of the art type was doomed to have a limited life span there was really only 1 new plant the bonsai which came in 4 slightly different shapes and colors all meant mostly as indoor type d cor that you would place on a table its small size also didnt allow for much creativity in use the seeds for each bonsai were also uniquely labeled so you knew immediately which one of the bonsai you were getting which isnt the case with the new plants aside from the cocoa tree fragrant seed all 15 other plants will have the same seed name peculiar seed most people will have less than 5 bonsai in their houses but will have an insane number of the other bigger decorative plants which can be used to shape original gardens the new plants are mainly outdoors plants and i can promise you that in most cases you will want way more than one of each type
9197026 not quite but each time will indeed be a dice roll there are 12 different monsters that will spawn the seeds the plants and monsters have been divided into 4 groups monster group a b c and d each count 3 monsters then we have plant group 1 to plant group 4 that each contains 4 new plants all 12 monsters will spawn fragrant seeds but monsters of group a will also spawn the peculiar seeds from plant group 1 while monsters of group b will also spawn the peculiar seeds from plant group 2 and so on so basically when hunting monsters from group a you have 1 chance out of 5 of getting a specific plant from group 1 ditto for any monster group and their matching plant group note that you will never get a group 1 seed from a group b monster etc
9197027 you will have to figure out which monsters they spawn on but i can tell you they will spawn on 3 creatures that dwell in the tokuno islands on 1 bug type creature on 1 creature found in despise among other places on 1 swamp creature on 1 undead on 1 humanoid spellcaster on 1 arachnid on 1 karma sensitive creature in ilshenar on 1 a compact sized creature and last but not least on 1 creature that lurks in the twisted wealds the drop rate is 50 chance there will be no seed 15 chance of a fragrant seed and 35 chance of a random peculiar seed
9197028 you can hunt them yourself or buy your seeds from hunters except for the cocoa tree that will produce seeds and resources some of the monsters will be difficult for crafters but some others will be reasonably accessible to less combat oriented characters
9197029 the plants had been selected long before this was ever made public but despite that after reading the comments wishes on the boards i can assure you that the majority of gardeners will be very pleased with some of the new plants that said if you look at the inside uo art files you can see that a lot of plants mainly trees are in 2 pieces bare tree leaves in order to give you such plants we would need to make them into a deed or get new art so for the purpose of gardening these plants are excluded which means sorry folks there will be no pine tree p
9197030 because after testing what they would look like rehued same as the colored plants from the original set i didnt want to be held responsible for a worldwide eyesore epidemic
9197031 adding new plants wasnt in the planning could there and should there be new resources absolutely adding them to the system isnt overly complex and could possibly happen at some point in time some pretty cool ideas were thrown out there on the forums but this honestly isnt on the radar at the moment and you guys will understand better what were so busy with at the next town hall
9197032 im soooooooo not telling you yes im a tease d but seriously when gardening first came out the most fun i had was eagerly waiting for my babies to make their entry in the world would it be a boy a girl would it look like mom or dad whose eyes hair you get the drift the speculation is half the fun

9197071 general conclusion from 1870 which can be applied virtually unchanged to the collapse of 1940 the incompetence of the french high command explained much but the basic reasons for the catastrophe lay deeper as the french themselves in their humiliation were to discern the collapse at sedan like that of the prussians at jena sixty four years earlier was the result not simply of faulty command but of a faulty military system and the military system of a nation is not an independent section of the social system but an aspect of it in its totality the french had good reason to look on their disasters as a judgment

9197136 so far yes its been a little bit frustrating and disappointing
9197137 we want to win we want to be competitive we came off such a great year last year our team has been phenomenal this year we just havent had the runs havent had the cars and when we did have the cars havent been able to put it all together so thats definitely been frustrating
9197138 you dont have to win a race to win the championship in my opinion
9197139 i think were one of the most consistent teams out there but we do need to get our performance up a notch to compete with those guys
9197140 so we got some work cut out for us but were certainly not counting ourselves out
9197141 to me its not about a win its about consistently running up front leading laps
9197142 this is a perfect example this race track when we lead a lap here were usually in the top five thats fairly typical for us so its about being competitive enough to get up there and lead laps when we lead laps we do very well
9197143 i feel like team wise were in a great position to be solid enough for these next couple of races to get in the chase
9197144 theyre two good tracks for us auto club and richmond and i feel like weve been getting better and better last week was a clutch performance by us and i feel like were going to need two more of those add comment

9197154 it is unacceptable that in a nation that is as prosperous as ours that 37 3 million people including 13 3 million children continue to live in poverty at 12 5 percent the poverty rate indicates that reducing poverty is not a priority for this nation
9197155 for catholic charities usa and our 1 700 local member agencies who serve nearly 8 million in need a year the poverty rate is not just another economic statistic this unacceptable figure represents the millions of families we see each and every day who are struggling just to make ends meet
9197156 substantial decreases in these numbers must occur in order to alleviate the struggles that millions are experiencing
9197157 the downturn in the economy is making matters worse across our nation catholic charities agencies are seeing more and more people having to choose between putting food on the table paying their utility bills or making their rent or mortgage payments
9197158 needing help with food rent clothing and prescriptions are all symptoms of much larger problems facing the poor and vulnerable in america such as low wages and the lack of affordable housing and health care

9197160 let these troubling poverty statistics be a call to action for each of us as a nation we must demand that our current and future leaders give a much higher priority to the needs of the poor in their policymaking decisions
9197161 in this election year candidates for public office especially our presidential candidates must move from rhetoric to action and propose comprehensive plans to address the needs of more than 37 million people living in poverty in the united states over the next decade
9197162 we must no longer ignore the injustice of poverty and the extreme inequality in america
9197163 do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good and pleasing and perfect

9197173 for me my work is all about the power of evangelization
9197174 at the age of almost three i began drawing with instruction from my mothers cousin the artist george klein i was recovering from a mastoid operation at the time and klein brought me pencils and paper
9197175 i also worked as a draftsman for the firm of sparkman and stephen they were naval architects in new york city i never ceased with my artistic pursuit of painting
9197176 i enlisted in the united states air force in 1941 until the time of the surrender of japan
9197177 i continued to paint throughout this time and then pursued my studies in architecture at columbia university
9197178 it was at fordham that i met a jesuit by the name of father john hooper he was highly instrumental in my thinking further about the catholic faith in retrospect it was actually my interactions with the various chaplains in the service that initially sparked my interest in the first place
9197179 i furthermore became interested in and explored the history of art and architecture i was captivated with the construction of the vatican and saint peters basilica this certainly piqued my interest in catholicism as well
9197180 i designed the renovation for the office space for the morgan guarantee bank of new york
9197181 this was the project that found myself in the design of housing and schools as well it was certainly this period of my life that acted as a catalyst for my present vocation as a deacon in nigeria i found myself ministering to the poor and the sick

9197200 two teachers took her upstairs and she had to sit down for the rest of the day and not do anything
9197201 she came home from school a couple of times and said i got in trouble for doing a cartwheel
9197202 we think it is a very harsh thing to do and we would encourage the school rather than just banning it outright to really look for some providers of developmental gymnastics programs give the kids a real learning experience on how to do these things safely
9197203 she played well that time and im looking forward to continuing to move well and serve well

9197327 it was my first fight in the ufc and everything worked better than i thought
9197328 it was great for my career and an important step
9197329 i was a little bit anxious and excited before the fight but i think it is normal and it made me smarter during the fight
9197330 i like to be like that and in combination with my confidence it is perfect being in shape confident and a little bit anxious and excited are the perfect combination in my opinion to do a good job
9197331 i loved what i saw in ufc 3 and i got crazy with that
9197332 i decided that it was what i wanted to be a fighter
9197333 i come from a very humble and poor family from a small city inside brazil
9197334 at the beginning they didnt understand that i wanted to be fighter and what it was because we had difficulties to even get food for all my family but later they realized that it was a serious job that i work hard at and then they started to support me
9197335 after i arrived here everything started to work very well in my life and in my career i have a lot of friends inside the team that have been pushing me to the top always believing me and helping me in everything i could learn and improve my skills at btt learning not only jiu jitsu but martial arts in general
9197336 i think i have a strong mind and that makes me work hard trying to reach my dreams
9197337 i am a worker i have been working hard everyday and studying a lot of positions and submissions
9197338 he is a great fighter and he will demand a lot of attention from me during the fight

9197340 hes telling me which strategy i have to use and what i need to improve in my game to minimize the risks during the fight i can say that i am totally confident in my game and strategy for this fight
9197341 if it a win happens it will make it easier for me to have a chance to fight for the belt i cant wait for the time to step in the octagon for this fight
9197342 i know that it a title shot depends on how my performances will be in my next fights
9197343 but i think he silva is great fighter and he looks to be a humble person i will think about his weaknesses when and if i have the chance to fight him

9197381 i have been fascinated with order and organization my entire life when i add color to that mix i am in heaven my color collages and abstract paintings are intended to be orderly i believe in chaos theory and that everything from our veins and vessels to the trees and mountains is patterned i revel in the fact that color can be ephemerally orderly and in pointing that out through abstraction furthermore the collage process includes destruction which naturally is as powerful as creation and which allows for something to be created out of that which may have been on its way to the trash to me these color abstracts portray the persons inner harmony or outer environment and are in their own way portraits
9197382 thats how high gas prices are im at the gate right now this is really happening proof gas prices are too high tell whoever the next president is we need to bring gas prices down
9197383 democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard
9197384 most vegetarians look so much like the food they eat that they can be classified as cannibals
9197385 by the governments own admission the previous books contained biased and discriminatory content
9197386 the progress and development of a country depends on the quality of education of its people it is a historical fact that the muslims ruled the world for hundred of years on the basis of the knowledge acquired by their intellectuals philosophers and scientists
9197387 as long as the muslims acted upon the hadith to acquire knowledge is the duty of each muslim male and female they ruled the world
9197388 remission is allowed on the basis of reading the holy quran understanding the meaning of this book or acquiring proficiency in understanding fundamentals of islam examination of having learnt quran by heart hafiz quran is held for convicts who learnt quran by heart during confinement
9197389 we were worried over this so we expedited our efforts to ensure that the christian prisoners enjoy equal privileges in jail
9197390 we have been successful in resisting conversions in jails now christian prisoners are doing the basic bible course which makes a difference in their spiritual life and encourages them in their faith we are happy for christian prisoners would be granted remission on the basis of passing the bible course
9197391 therefore we continued to campaign for remission not knowing that it had been already granted
9197392 a notification has been circulated from home department of the government of punjab in which it is stated that the government of punjab is pleased to make some amendments in the pakistan prisons rules 1978

9197394 the situation is very grim in the interior villages where we have not much information
9197395 christians hiding in the forest dont have anything to eat yesterday evening one priest called me and said they were hiding in the jungle for the past three days the attackers are sparing no one
9197396 consistent with the maoist stamp in the kind of operation they undertake
9197397 the assailants had left a note written on the letterhead of vamsadhara zonal committee signed by one azad and it is consistent with the maoist methods
9197398 while all christian schools and colleges in madhya pradesh remained closed on friday in protest a group of people pelted stones at carmel convent school st theresa school and church and st pauls church in gwalior
9197399 in deep anguish and pain we the christian community of the delhi and national capital region submit this memorandum to you and not to the chief minister of orissa because we believe that by not stopping the ethnic cleansing of christians in orissa in the last six days he has abdicated his constitutional duties to the sangh parivar family of hindu extremist groups and thereby has forfeited his right to be in government
9197400 nuns have been raped pastors priests religious workers injured in their hundreds
9197401 over forty churches have been destroyed many for the second time apart from once again hundreds upon hundreds of houses burnt in towns villages and forest settlements christians have been chased and hunted like animals
9197402 we would have liked ideally that this matter be handed over to the cbi because those responsible should get justice immediately as judicial probe takes longer time
9197403 there is terror all over those who are hiding in the forest and those in the homes no one feels safe the areas are totally deserted
9197404 a lot more than what was quoted in the government report the number can be over 1 000

9197407 it has been directed that the state shall requisition required number of security forces and the central government shall provide the same
9197408 further it was directed that the state shall furnish the details of how much security forces it has applied for with the central government and how many has the central government so far provided for the maintenance of law and order situation in the state

9197464 biosolids will become a larger issue as more sewage treatment plants come on line
9197465 as a result of these changes fewer projects will undergo an environmental assessment and some major projects that would have undergone a full scale assessment will now be speeded through the process
9197466 this backwards step more than outweighs the process improvements emphasized in the government news release and by the minister
9197467 instead the regulatory changes are announced as a done deal and were left to wonder which specific projects will be subject to the looser requirements thats not the right way to protect the environment
9197468 it has brought the terminology into line with the science

9197816 but this old raf volunteer had seen it all before during the war i was looking down unlike them big eyed newcomer boys i just arrive back in england and there on the pavement before me i spy a brooch what a piece of good fortune what a little bit of luck lying lost this precious oval jewel shimmered the radiant iridescent green of a humming bird caught by the sun my aunt corinne would have raised her hands to the heavens to call it a sign now these were the thoughts that passed through my head in the three steps it took me to reach that brooch one perhaps it fall from a young womans coat cha so my blessing was anothers misfortune two it was an old woman that lost it from her purse maybe the police station was the proper place to take it and three hortense this deep green brooch would look so pretty on her i conjured up an image in me mind see me take the sparkling brooch to pin it to her dress near her neck against her smooth nut brown skin and look see her touch the pin then tilt her head to charm a smile on me so all this rumination is taking place as i move closer i was about to bend my knee so i could reach the brooch when hear this it flew away black flecks suddenly pitting the air that jewel was no more than a cluster of flies caught by the light the radiant iridescent green the movement of their squabbling backs my eyes no longer believed what they saw for after the host of flies flew they left me with just the small piece of brown dogs shit they had all gathered on was this a sign maybe for one of the big eyed newcomer boys walk straight along and step right in the muck

9197859 senator mccain made a historic and strategic choice in choosing gov sarah palin with the clear intent of reaching out to female hillary supporters theres only one obvious problem shes not hillary clinton
9197860 and so it is unlikely given the right wing bush like positions of mccain and palin that the republican ticket can win over a significant percentage of the more progressive minded hillary supporters
9197861 sen john mccains choice of alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate is a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9197862 gov palin may be the second woman vice presidential candidate on a major party ticket but she is not the right woman sadly she is a woman who opposes womens rights just like john mccain
9197863 governor palin is going to be an invaluable addition to the ticket because she understands the importance of respecting and understanding the american taxpayer and fighting wasteful spending
9197864 she is an exceedingly effective leader on the energy issue and understands that mccains focus to bring down energy costs will translate across the economy
9197865 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me almost 88 years to the day after women of america first gained the right to vote
9197866 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9197867 john mccain will have to explain why he believes sarah palin the former mayor of a town of 7 000 with absolutely no foreign policy experience is the best person to serve literally a heartbeat away from the presidency

9197878 though many things have been said about me and salman nothing has changed my relationship with him ill always be thankful to salman and if it means that i lose film offers then so be it
9197879 this is a professional industry i was a complete outsider here when i joined nobody knew anything about me nobody knew what my nature was like for all you know i would have signed a film and never turned up i could have been the most unprofessional person the biggest hurdle for me was to prove myself professionally

9197883 a lei bosman veio expandir o mercado e o nosso futebol dos que mais se ressente nesse aspecto durante largos anos em que representei o benfica lembro me de ter apenas dois estrangeiros no plantel
9197884 a m stica no benfica tem os dias contados apesar do clube ter ainda jogadores que podem transmitir essa ideia o futuro pr ximo continuar a ser dos estrangeiros em particular da am rica de l ngua espanhola mais barata que o mercado brasileiro

9197888 in between he took off for about a week as a result he is now working round the clock to get back on track in the film srk will be seen in a double role in the first half he will play this complete simpleton almost like a village bumpkin and then to impress anushka who plays the leading lady he turns into this slick city guy
9197889 shah rukh has already shot with many get ups there is one scene where he plays a geek and his hair is all plastered down he also sports a small moustache ala charlie chaplin with half pants and everything
9197890 similarly for another look his clothes are all flashy and over the top then in another look he plays the nri who is visiting india
9197891 its all been done very well they arent taking the mickey out of anyone else in the industry like the current trend in other films when shah rukh heard about it he was all game but he was quite clear he wanted it done tastefully as he didnt want to rake any controversy
9197892 securenvoys solutions are designed for companies that need high levels of security but dont want the hassle and cost of using separate security tokens smartcards or usb keys
9197893 we believe lancers e risk solutions carries the requisite credentials to helps us establish a strong footprint in india
9197894 with securenvoy token less two factor authentication solutions enterprises in addition to implementing a multi layered approach to enterprise security have also been known save 60 or more over other available hardware alternatives
9197895 it is not about depending or not depending on a few players of course it is an achievement but you can not just sit back on it and say we won the twenty20 world cup the tri series in australia or now here in sri lanka you have to continue doing it
9197896 if you have players like sachin and sehwag it really helps in doing and achieving these things consistently but it their absence is not really in control because at times you will have injuries
9197897 we didnt had ishant sharma we didnt had sachin and veeru sehwag but it is upto other individuals to take up the responsibility because there is no point in sitting and sulking about guys who are not there
9197898 they are the guys who are part of the 16 who can really make a difference and they were doing just that
9197899 but of course you miss individuals specially the great players
9197900 in the middle it is very important to rotate strikes and we have been able to do that we got the partnerships we played the spinners well we negotiated murali well i think we played him really well it has been tough over the years to play murali in sri lanka i think we tackled ajantha mendis quite well too
9197901 overall i was quite impressed by the way we performed
9197902 i really enjoyed the break and the main thing is i was enjoying the practice session more and it sets a good trend
9197903 you have to give 100 per cent there as well you just can not bat for 20 minutes and go under the shade when you feel from inside to go under the shade that is the time when you realize your body needs rest
9197904 i was happy to get some rest thanks to the selectors and the bcci
9197905 theyve been misleading us or they have not got their act together if it takes us another ten years to get a proper treaty in place that people can understand let us wait that ten years and spend that ten years doing something thats right instead of putting this treaty back to the people
9197906 i resent that comment and you shouldnt have used that comment ulick he didnt make the comment myles dungan did and everything ive said has been very measured on this both this morning and at other times and weve let this go interrupted by mcevaddy there you are interrupting me now you said you didnt interrupt he didnt say that you should not be using those terms he didnt if were to have some reasonable discussion and debate on this ill tell you what has to happen ulick we have to put people like you in your place youre a good businessman but you know sweet damn all about politics and what weve really got to do and this is the real problem here weve got to restore to dial eireann the democratic deficit between the dail and the people all the tds have left themselves with is responsibility and theyve given away authority its time for the dail to take back authority and to say to people like ulick the business of politics requires people to be able to find real solutions to problems
9197907 ulick i dont know anything about running your business my business is politics and its people like you and your other wealthy pal down in galway ganley walking on to the pitch with your millions of pounds sic and being able to tell us our business this is a little game for people like yourself and others
9197908 do you know that the people in germany voted for the third reich the people outside caesars palace sic voted for the crucifixion of christ what has a referendum got to do with if you ask the people tomorrow to vote for the government
9197909 weve got to restore to dial eireann the democratic deficit between the dail and the people
9197910 the no vote was a rather peculiar vote essentially it wasnt a vote against the detail of the lisbon treaty it was a no vote of a slightly schizophrenic nature and it was also very marginal a very very narrow victory

9197929 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
9197930 graeme smiths response would be different if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
9197931 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems that these players refuse to understand the problems being faced by us

9198047 figuring out the right amount to raise is more art than science but can have a big impact on the company if you raise too little money you may run out before you have proven the business sufficiently to raise additional capital in other words raising too little money can be fatal on the other hand if you raise too much money early on you could well be selling off too much of the company for too little capital companies should leverage early stage venture money to drive up the value of the company by proving out as much of the business as quickly as possible so that the next time the company fundraises they will be able to bring in larger amounts of money while suffering smaller amounts of dilution

9198058 ts been my experience previously working at compaq and later starting up our own business six years ago that in a fixed bid situation either the client gets taken to the cleaners or the developers do with fixed bid the requirements of a project have to be so locked down and fine grained that there is no flexibility if requirements change costs for the developer can spin out of control for a developer to make profit they have to bid the project up really high to cover any unforeseen scope creep

9198065 senator obama saying the question of when life begins is above his pay grade when whether youre looking at it scientifically or theologically if he were to come and say help me out here madam speaker what would you tell him
9198066 the notion that the catholic church declared abortion a sin at the same time as the pill is patently absurd and shows that pelosi has either lied about studying the issue in terms of church history or lied about what she found

9198103 t he two constructs are identical in every way except how they handle failure they both produce a fatal error
9198104 the techniques used for identification of service members since wwii has definitely evolved incorporating the latest state of the art technology such as computers and analytical software the most dramatic change has been the introduction of mitochrondrial dna analysis which can be used to determine a maternal line
9198105 this form of dna preserves well in the bones cilhi started using mtdna sequence data in identifications in 1992 while the technology in its earlier years had a few problems the technology now is better than ever we have used mtdna sequence data to aid in the identification of about 45 percent of our cases during the last five years
9198106 we are ready to deploy if called upon for assistance
9198107 we have not been requested to assist as of now

9198109 working blind i e with no prior knowledge of the physical characteristics or even the number of individuals believed to be involved in the case incident the anthropologist derives a biological profile for the remains
9198110 once the remains have been identified by our laboratory and signed off by the laboratory scientific director a report is delivered to the service casualty office after review a casualty officer contacts the family member listed as next of kin
9198111 the family member is then fully briefed on the identification process how we came to the results the search and recovery efforts involved in recovering the remains and any other information available
9198112 there are remains that we have not been able to identify given existing technology
9198113 for example many vietnam era cases received in the laboratory in the 1980s were not identifiable given the technology available at that time since then however dna technology first used by the cilhi in 1992 has allowed for many of those cases to be successfully resolved to this end the cilhi is actively engaged in research on a variety of topics that it is hoped will lead to future identifications
9198114 the casualty data analysts research their records and historical documents to compile names and background data necessary for us to determine specific loss areas the analysts plot on a map service members last know locations we use this information to aid in compiling mission lists
9198115 we conduct full scale investigations to include interviews with locals and witnesses to determine if a site with remains exists we also look at whether remains would still be at a site or if scavengers have recovered the remains we analyze how long it would take to recover remains from a specific area and the impact of weather and terrain in that area
9198116 we do rely on first hand accounts of sites where remains may exist we interview witnesses locals that may live near a possible site and those who have seen the site for themselves
9198117 all these interviews are part of the investigation and aid in determining if we should conduct an excavation in a specific area
9198118 evidence recovered in the field such as identification tags and aircraft data plates can give strong clues as to whom the remains belong to but can rarely constitute the basis of an identification
9198119 for example we have on occasion recovered id tags that did not belong to the individual whose remains we recovered for this reason each case must undergo a thorough analytical process before identification can be made
9198120 it was agreed there would be 5 joint recovery missions in 2001 of those three of the operations were in unsan kaechon and kujang where battles involving the u s armys 1st cavalry 2nd infantry and 25th infantry division fought in november 1950
9198121 these last two operations of the year will be on the east and west sides of the chosin reservoir in the northeast portion of north korea korean war analysts believe that as many as 750 u s soldiers and marines may have been lost during battles in november and december near chosin
9198122 the north koreans have been cooperative in allowing us to conduct recovery operations because of the agreements we have been able to bring home 127 remains of those remains we have identified and returned 11 service members to their families
9198123 we identify more than 100 remains every year we work so hard on so many cases that you dont always feel the impact until you actually encounter a family member who is affected when we meet family members of those we have identified we are able to appreciate the actual affect our work has made on those families
9198124 it gives me an intense feeling of great job satisfaction however the flip side is when we havent located a service member or are unable to identify an individual it sometimes gives a feeling of failure
9198125 every family that we are able to provide some closure for is always considered a success
9198126 you might as well raise up and take your shots like a man
9198127 my sweet would you prefer a red or green apple

9198129 you should draw a high rise condo with a bunch of yuppies on the roof doing coke if that doesnt convey downtown i dont know what does
9198130 i think he has insulted the intelligence of all women
9198131 insulted doesnt even come close to the way i feel about this gop vp pick
9198132 i i still feel like this has to be a joke like a week from now mccain will tell us weve all been punkd
9198133 i think its hypocritical that mccain chose her to be his running mate i think hes trying to steal votes from obama by doing this
9198134 teddy roosevelt only because she wears glasses and has a mustache the similarities stop there pfffft
9198135 it also bothers me that she made a point to say her son went to iraq on sept 11th will she want to reinstate the draft lots of things worry me about this pick
9198136 its a big lift off of my shoulders because i know that im not going to play the perfect game said bishop who was named the starter for sundays labour day classic against the winnipeg blue bombers 1 p
9198137 there isnt somebody behind me that has been there done that and won championships any time youre in a situation like that youre always wondering what happens that if you mess up on this play will i be taken out of the game its a great to have that feeling
9198138 im not pointing fingers at anyone but it just wasnt a good mix said adam rita general manager and director of football operations with the argos
9198139 we had hoped that we could get the depth that we wanted at quarterback by bringing in kerry and it didnt work we decided that we had to move on
9198140 he is in the position where he needs to be the guy rita said
9198141 i tried to provide him with that opportunity and saskatchewan would be the best fit for him because of the injury situation and different things happening at the quarterback position hes a tough guy physically and he can take a lot of hits he gives the riders a strong presence that way
9198142 my mom was a hard working lady with seven kids said bishop who with his wife lasonya have a daughter nia and are expecting a second child in october
9198143 from that day on my attitude changed i started studying more because the whole time on earth i was happy when she was happy that really motivated me to get back into it i did everything right from that point on and a lot of things changed for me
9198144 saskatchewan got a deal if he indeed reaches his potential rita said
9198145 sometimes bargains come in many different ways there was a time element and we needed to get things turned around i know that saskatchewan wouldnt have made the deal if i had held him out for ransom they would have stuck with what they had and moved on
9198146 last year he was 11 1 as a starter said miller
9198147 what i knew of his ability to run throw and really his personality i knew that he would blend in really quickly
9198148 hes putting in many hours beyond what we ask the other quarterbacks to do miller said
9198149 part of the time that he has invested is in direct work with some of the receivers and people he has talked into staying in the film room with him then they can learn and discuss things and get on the same page
9198150 if its not going well we wont hesitate to play richie
9198151 i think its pretty clear you need two functioning quarterbacks in this league and were lucky to have that
9198152 its about winning and we all signed up for this and we know whats at stake and what the opportunity is
9198153 the fact weve already won the season series against toronto is good and the only pressure we face now is what we put on ourselves
9198154 toronto is fighting for their lives like us and we have to approach every game with a playoff mentality because for us its a playoff game
9198155 were still in a position to make the playoffs and every game is critically important because of our record
9198156 we have good guys whove bought into what were doing and now its just a matter of going out and executing the defence that were beginning to have an understanding for
9198157 once we have a better understanding and we have people who are playing next to each other for more than one week at a time the communication becomes a little easier when you get some continuity in the players and calls then it becomes more instinctive
9198158 its kind of tough the first part of the season with injuries and guys having to move around a lot guys were having to do extra things but its a good feeling that the last couple of games weve been able to play as a unit
9198159 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9198160 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9198161 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9198162 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9198163 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9198164 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country
9198165 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9198166 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9198167 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9198168 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9198169 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9198170 cest brice hortefeux qui tait la manoeuvre pour ce que lon a appel laffaire de mon appartement
9198171 half the country are women dont you think we should be represented by a woman also its about time
9198172 shes a woman that is pro life but im pretty sure that she understands womens issues better than a man
9198173 it reminds me of when walter mondale made the decision to choose geraldine ferraro as a running mate in 1984
9198174 oh my god people were crying the enthusiasm the emotions
9198175 if sen mccain believes that putting a woman who is conservative and antithetical to all the issues that hillary believes in is going to attract former hillary supporters i think thats gravely in error
9198176 would never consider vot ing for a ticket just because it has a woman on it for show
9198177 to me this is a calculated manipulative appeal to women who were supportive of hillary
9198178 but i was not in it for hillary i was in it for what she stood for obama stands for the same things
9198179 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9198180 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9198181 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me
9198182 you really have to have a high level of respect for gov palin in the sense that she has this real ability to connect with people
9198183 i think were going to have to examine our tag line dangerously inexperienced
9198184 selskabet sagde til lufthavnen at det overvejede at skifte flyet ud med et andet
9198185 enige om behovet for at standse fors g p at bruge georgien situationen til at ge sp ndinger i europa ved at spekulere i ikke eksisterende trusler i forbindelse med andre tidligere sovjetstater
9198186 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
9198187 that is not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
9198188 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief that s a debate i m ready to have
9198189 t he records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9198190 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9198191 no amount of convincing is going to get them to change their mind and they might become aggravated enough to actually start a counter campaign
9198192 possibly mccain will die during his first term in that case palin will have people around her to tell her what she doesnt know and the world will continue
9198193 mccain is reaching back to an outdated model of casually made choices
9198194 realizing hes going to leave with less than 1 000
9198195 the motorcyclist was not wearing a helmet at the time
9198196 je veux absolument remercier tous ceux qui mont aid mon partenaire lachlan et ma maman de mavoir soutenu et de me voir gagner lor parce que c tait tr s important davoir ces deux personnes pr s de moi ici
9198197 shes just a good person and shes dedicated to her family
9198198 its a good family it will be a good home
9198199 even when something bad would happen like if he didnt pass a test or didnt do as well as he wanted to he always looked at the positive side
9198200 i remember him liking to go to parties in high school but not for the reasons that people think
9198201 it was never about drugs or alcohol with him he just really enjoyed being around people talking and interacting and meeting new people
9198202 giving him his space to cope and when hes ready thats when ill step in and do whatever he asks
9198203 its unexplainable to someone who has never experienced it how it feels to bury your child
9198204 i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy it just makes me hold on to the child i have even tighter because life is never promised so im sure dre is holding on tighter
9198205 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9198206 its just a normal illness she hasnt visited a hospital or anything like that shes at home in bed just unable to sing

9198224 the necromancers glowing blue sword hissed and sizzled with each snowflake unfortunate enough to fall against the exposed blade
9198225 she asked me to read from the bible to her

9198231 k ln bietet uns eine ideale plattform unsere branchenmesse auf deutschem boden auch international als leitmesse zu verankern
9198232 sollte es nicht gelingen den spirit von leipzig zu bertragen und den charakter der order und fachmesse aufrecht zu erhalten wird die neue gamescom nicht lange von den nicht biu unternehmen mitgetragen werden k nnen denn materialschlachten kann sich keiner lange leisten und dann sehen wir uns in zwei jahren in london paris oder madrid wieder ohne deutschen handel ohne deutschen publisher und ohne deutschen branchenverband
9198233 die leipziger messe hat geholfen in deutschland die internationale leitmesse f r computerspiele zu etablieren und wird nun einfach fallen gelassen wie eine hei e kartoffel wenn alles immer dann wenn es wirklich wichtig wird wieder in den westen verlegt wird wozu wurde dann in leipzig so viel aufgebaut

9198240 momentan sieht es danach aus dass der kapit n noch eine l ngere trainingspause einlegen muss
9198241 das war h rter als erwartet ich musste alles geben um vorne zu sein
9198242 paul hatte einen kleinen rutscher in seiner schnellsten runde mit vier mercedes unter den besten acht ist es eine starke teamleistung
9198243 bei mattias ist der dritte gang defekt deshalb war nicht mehr m glich schade er war das ganze wochenende vorne dabei
9198244 die menschen sind ins freie gest rmt viele hausw nde haben risse zahlreiche fensterscheiben sind zu bruch gegangen
9198245 das sind jahrhundertealte traditionen und ich werde sie weiter verteidigen
9198246 wir wissen aber noch nicht ob es michelles fahrrad ist
9198247 der stuhl k nnte im zusammenhang mit der tat stehen muss aber nicht
9198248 ein hinweis ist ja auch hilfreich wenn man etwas ausschlie en kann
9198249 es k nnte sein dass mit zu wenig gegessen oder getrunken hat
9198250 er lag v llig leblos am boden der puls kam nur ganz kurz dann war er wieder weg
9198251 sein gesicht seine augen haben mich das schlimmste bef rchten lassen
9198252 hier geht es auch um menschen hier geht es nicht nur um punkte und siege
9198253 im krankenhaus habe ich wieder den k mpfer mit gesehen der am liebsten aus dem bett springen m chte und zur ck aufs spielfeld will er war mehr bei seinem fc als bei seinem gesundheitszustand
9198254 man sollte von unserer seite aus nicht so viel in den zwischenfall hineininterpretieren wir waren auch davor nicht pr sent
9198255 wir wissen dass wir mit 5 1 prozent der stimmen nicht die gesamte politik bestimmen k nnen
9198256 ich bin bereits von der dfl informiert worden die sind genauso wie wir von dem bericht auf spiegel online berrascht worden
9198257 aber ich sage ihnen wenn einer beim spiel karlsruhe gegen siegen auf karlsruhe setzt dann hat er denke ich einfach ahnung
9198258 die familien porsche und pi ch stehen voll und ganz hinter dr wiedeking und dem vorstand der porsche automobil holding se wir haben alle beschl sse in sachen vw gemeinsam und einvernehmlich getragen daran gibt es nichts zu r tteln
9198259 wir wollen ein neues denken in sachen er ffnungsfeier wir wollen dass ganz london involviert ist
9198260 die londoner spiele m ssen zutiefst demokratisch sein die londoner b rger sollen das gef hl haben direkt teilzunehmen ich denke wir werden das sowohl bei der er ffnungs als auch bei der abschlussfeier sehen
9198261 in sachen gro artiger organisation fantastischer sportst tten gastfreundlicher einstellung und stolz war peking superb
9198262 es gibt dinge die wir besser k nnen und tun werden ich habe viele chinesen gesehen die vor den stadien gestanden haben gewisserma en auf der falschen seite des zauns eher als beobachter denn teilnehmer wir m ssen diesen trend umkehren und unsere spiele zug nglicher machen
9198263 i think the key point to be made here is that every one of these people signed contracts acknowledging they were independent contractors they contractually agreed that they would take care of their own health benefits and all the rest of that stuff the irs has never challenged the treatment of our wrestlers and they have audited the company several times
9198264 this lawsuit kind of came out of the blue in one sense but levy threatened us years ago and i think i know who is really behind the whole thing
9198265 why is the intelligent designer in intelligent design the christian god
9198266 because worshiping an ugly six armed women with blue skin holding a snake many swords and having a long tong dose not sound vary intelligent
9198267 why is it that the athiests always seem to be the better educated intelligent more articulate and more rational than their christian opponents
9198268 so your saying its better to not think at all
9198269 as politically incorrect as it is to say i firmly believe that oprah is
9198270 jesus told us to stay away from false religions they are all lies created by satan and have never had any use to humans so judaism islam hinduism are all lies created by satan that must be avoided
9198271 well the devil is a liar when that happens jesus will done come back and take his people so yes it will be silenced when we gone and they still here
9198272 just like what nazi germany did to the jews so liberal america is now doing to the evangelical christians its no different it is the same thing it is happening all over again it is the democratic congress the liberal based media and the homosexuals who want to destroy the christians wholesale abuse and discrimination and the worst bigotry directed toward any group in america today more terrible than anything suffered by any minority in history
9198273 we just want jews to be perfected as they say
9198274 the idea that religion and politics dont mix was invented by the devil to keep christians from running their own country
9198275 in winning a nation to the gospel the sword as well as the pen must be used
9198276 there is no such thing as separation of church and state it is merely a figment of the imagination of infidels
9198277 id like for you to take but your paper might not allow you to do it and that is to take the jewish element in the aclu which is trying to drive christianity out of the public place and id like to see you do the something objective there because the aclu is made up of a tremendous amount of jewish attorneys
9198278 for me i dont think that wiccans would meet the standard of kind of being humane providers of domestic violence shelters
9198279 we know who the homicidal maniacs are they are the ones cheering and dancing right now we should invade their countries kill their leaders and convert them to christianity
9198280 two things made this country great white men amp christianity the degree these two have diminished is in direct proportion to the corruption and fall of the nation every problem that has arisen sic can be directly traced back to our departure from gods law and the disenfranchisement of white men
9198281 they would have us believe that islam is just as good as christianity christianity was founded by the virgin born son of god jesus christ islam was founded by muhammad a demon possessed pedophile who had 12 wives the last one of which was a 9 year old girl and i will tell you allah is not jehovah either jehovah s not going to turn you into a terrorist that ll try to bomb people and take the lives of thousands and thousands of people
9198282 atheistic secular humanists should be removed from office and christians should be elected government and true christianity are inseparable
9198283 nobody has the right to worship on this planet any other god than jehovah and therefore the state does not have the responsibility to defend anybodys pseudo right to worship an idol
9198284 no i dont know that atheists should be considered citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god
9198285 aids is the wrath of a just god against homosexuals to oppose it would be like an israelite jumping in the red sea to save one of pharoahs chariottiers
9198286 the church has through the centuries understood that ideas are really more dangerous than other weapons their use should be restricted
9198287 the unitarian churches are extremely deceptive and deny the saving power of christ by saying there are other routes and roads to god jesus said he was the way and the truth and no one comes to the father but by him i personally think its for liberals who want to get their ears tickled
9198288 ever since bibles got taken out schools did you notice more shootings
9198289 actually secularism is one of the greatest hindrances to science nowadays and nobody is a good and moral person
9198290 by the definition of religion it is impossible not to have a religion or to keep it from affecting your actions and beliefs and atheism is a religion it just believes that the self is god at least without being completely without morals and a code of belief
9198291 peace is not the ultimate goal nor is it attainable
9198292 hear me out i agree we as christians are supposed to pray for our enemies but not for their peace because if they are at peace then they are not searching for god christianity teaches quite explicitly that christianity is the only way to go to heaven so if we prayed that these people who are heading to hell have peace then we are not loving them as we are commanded to do it is in their best interest to be uneasy with their beliefs because these are incorrect and are leading them to hell so we do pray for our enemies but we pray for their salvation and their defeat not for their peace
9198293 i will not pray for peace between religions because if people follow any of those religions then they cannot and will not be at peace with each other
9198294 yes i pray for the defeat of my enemies just as david did
9198295 we dont necessarily discriminate we simply exclude certain types of people
9198296 evolution is a bankrupt speculative philosophy not a scientific fact only a spiritually bankrupt society could ever believe it only atheists could accept this satanic theory
9198297 it couldnt have been because our school systems teach our children that they are nothing but glorified apes who have evolutionized out of some primordial soup of mud by teaching evolution as fact
9198298 the jews are returning to their land of unbelief they are spiritually blind and desperately in need of their messiah and savior
9198299 one day i hope in the next ten years i trust that we will have more christian day schools than there are public schools
9198300 the end goal of gay activism is the criminalization of christianity
9198301 the poor homosexuals they have declared war upon nature and now nature is extracting an awful retribution aids
9198302 just like what nazi germany did to the jews so liberal america is now doing to the evangelical christians its no different it is the same thing it is happening all over again it is the democratic congress the liberal based media and the homosexuals who want to destroy the christians wholesale abuse and discrimination and the worst bigotry directed toward any group in america today more terrible than anything suffered by any minority in history

9198320 atheistic secular humanists should be removed from office and christians should be elected government and true christianity are inseparable
9198321 nobody has the right to worship on this planet any other god than jehovah and therefore the state does not have the responsibility to defend anybodys pseudo right to worship an idol
9198322 no i dont know that atheists should be considered citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god

9198327 actually secularism is one of the greatest hindrances to science nowadays and nobody is a good and moral person
9198328 by the definition of religion it is impossible not to have a religion or to keep it from affecting your actions and beliefs and atheism is a religion it just believes that the self is god at least without being completely without morals and a code of belief
9198329 peace is not the ultimate goal nor is it attainable
9198330 hear me out i agree we as christians are supposed to pray for our enemies but not for their peace because if they are at peace then they are not searching for god christianity teaches quite explicitly that christianity is the only way to go to heaven so if we prayed that these people who are heading to hell have peace then we are not loving them as we are commanded to do it is in their best interest to be uneasy with their beliefs because these are incorrect and are leading them to hell so we do pray for our enemies but we pray for their salvation and their defeat not for their peace
9198331 i will not pray for peace between religions because if people follow any of those religions then they cannot and will not be at peace with each other
9198332 yes i pray for the defeat of my enemies just as david did
9198333 we dont necessarily discriminate we simply exclude certain types of people
9198334 evolution is a bankrupt speculative philosophy not a scientific fact only a spiritually bankrupt society could ever believe it only atheists could accept this satanic theory

9198337 one day i hope in the next ten years i trust that we will have more christian day schools than there are public schools
9198338 the end goal of gay activism is the criminalization of christianity
9198339 the poor homosexuals they have declared war upon nature and now nature is extracting an awful retribution aids
9198340 gods unconditional love extends even in allowing a person to suffer for all eternity
9198341 god gives us all free will as long as its within his will
9198342 well no wonder everybody here is a freaking atheist that wont even take a second to honestly consider religion they choose to disbelieve in god so they justify their butt sex
9198343 yes god decided it was time for the evolutionist to go to hell
9198344 the good thing is that the creationist can ask god for forgiveness and have his reward in heaven but the atheist will be burning in hell
9198345 but god will punish people for their sins his punishment is a curse rather than a blessing it is intended to cause suffering rather than the rehabilitation of its object these are observations that are accepted by all bible believing christians
9198346 secondly a minor fact jesus doesnt save everyone therefore he doesnt want everyone to live
9198347 for the christians here do you feel you should question gods existance yes no and why if you would be so kind
9198348 salvation is the free gift of god and in return you must dedicate your entire life and everything you have to his service
9198349 but he will not care even if there is a reason god is a jealous god of wrath cruelty and revenge who enjoys punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation
9198350 me and jesus have a relationship weve just never met
9198351 out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations
9198352 come gather together for the great supper of god so that you may eat the flesh of kings generals and mighty men of horses and their riders and the flesh of all people free and slave small and great
9198353 god is a god of justice and wrath in addition to a god of love and mercy both are coterminous with his character hes not peaches amp cream and we dont want him to be
9198354 a christian must react with joy and pleasure to the visualization of god taking vengeance against his enemies without this spiritual affection gods heaven will be a kind of hell for him you are right that many people who today consider themselves to be christians do not have the regenerate spiritual affections that will make them feel satisfaction from gods kingdom
9198355 okay everyone knows about barack obama right well i have always felt ever since i saw him that theres something up with that guy i dont mean hes like crazy or anything but i feel spiritually uneasy whenever i look at him now i dont know if its just me but i have this nagging gut feeling and fear that he is the anti christ
9198356 the destruction of six million jews in europe was fulfilled prophecy
9198357 now this was the sin of your sister sodom she and her daughters were arrogant overfed and unconcerned they did not help the poor and needy 50 they were haughty and did detestable things before me therefore i did away with them as you have seen
9198358 friend how can you think there is so little to be concerned about
9198359 io so quel che verr fuori dalle intercettazioni e non ci posso far niente non posso scagliarmi contro questa piaga delle intercettazioni dopo che noi del pd le abbiamo sempre considerate necessarie per la giustizia specie quando sono contro berlusconi ed allora faccio il grande gesto e mi salvo almeno in parte il sedere

9198361 we tried different containers lighting and temperatures we wondered if the nectar mixture we created for them would work we wondered if the males would hatch at the same time as the females and then once they hatched we wondered if they would get together
9198362 i wondered did we do everything we could when no 15 accepted a male we knew we got it right
9198363 they get to feel the air under the wings drink nectar and leave eggs

9198423 our freshmen really showed the potential that this team possesses laira akin is coming back from a knee injury and ciara jones really showed how powerful she could be once we started getting her the balls she needed amy deelo really played some serious defense as well
9198424 if you eliminate errors you will win games we had too many errors and that put us in a bad position
9198425 we were thrilled with our comeback effort to not only tie with six seconds left in the game but to get the win early in overtime
9198426 our defending was better than our last game and our possession improved as the game progressed our finishing is a work in progress we need to be able to finish the chances we make for ourselves overall we are happy with the result we beat a very good ohio state team
9198427 give our team a lot of credit for their resiliency they have the belief that until the final whistle is blown they have the opportunity to win that takes focus and determination and that is what this team has lauren acree really created the first goal and then set her self up for the second the way she scored the second goal anyone could have done it but it was just her day we had too many shots from far away and too many unlucky ones that hit the post the things we didnt do earlier we did them finally at the end and finished

9198443 as parents and coaches we should be sufficiently motivated by good sportsmanship decency and common sense to keep ourselves from acting like idiots when our kids play sports

9198611 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move westward
9198612 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled there are vast areas of woodlands lakes and dark forests
9198613 weasels and otters and raccoons are already well re establishing themselves
9198614 and the european moose elk is poised to move westward indeed elk are already relatively common in the czech republic
9198615 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
9198616 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
9198617 they decimate not only mice but also other small mammals and snakes and other egg thieves
9198618 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes
9198619 because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves
9198620 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
9198621 the main problem will be the clich of the big bad wolf in the minds of many people wolves can of course be dangerous to humans in certain situations generally when they are backed into a corner but they are generally no threat to humans
9198622 europeans generally are very mindful of the dire effects that humans have had on the environment over the centuries and they are for the most part happy to see the return of bears and wolves and other creatures after near extinction of those species
9198623 as more predators move in the balance of nature returns to normal and we see a reduction in rats and mice and rabbits
9198624 those small creatures form the diet of predators such as the german sea eagle which was the emblem of germany for centuries but which was driven to the verge of extinction by unthinking hunters

9198911 how much do you get paid to be a foster parent
9198912 im excited ive been hoping for decades to see a woman on the republican ticket and governor palin was worth waiting for a reformer a seasoned executive and best of all normal and authentic great choice
9198913 im always pleased when a woman is given an opportunity for advancement i do think however that while senator barack obama showed impeccable judgment in his selection of senator joe biden who is someone who could step into the white house on day one should that become necessary i think you do have to question senator mccains judgment in selecting someone whose only experience really is having served as mayor of a small town of 9 000 and about one year in the governors office in alaska
9198914 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform
9198915 i had the opportunity to meet with gov sarah palin on my recent trip to anwr i found her to be very down to earth and personable she is a person who would feel at home in southern indiana she hunts and fishes and is pro life
9198916 sarah palins selection is an outstanding example of john mccains willingness to reach out to fresh voices embrace new leadership and continue the republican partys strong support of conservative women leaders
9198917 congratulations sara palin im sure you a wonderful person who has worked hard i wish good things for you
9198918 in light of his good faith we are certainly hoping the court will consider that
9198919 this is a great example of not letting a pollutant get into the environment its pollution prevention if you dont let it get in you dont worry about having to clean it up

9198938 when you have monetary tightening you do get lower growth that was expected

9199002 why did the senior us leadership allow their citizens to be present there when they had no right to be in the security zone and if they allowed it i begin to suspect that it was done intentionally to organize a small victorious war and if that failed they wanted to create an enemy out of russia and unite voters around one of the presidential candidates of course a ruling party candidate because it is only the ruling party that has this kind of resource
9199003 we have long ago recognized the borders of modern day ukraine
9199004 russia has recognized the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia we support russia russia is right and is defending its interests
9199005 step by step we actualize peoples wishes and strive to lead taiwan in a better direction
9199006 one hundred days is just the beginning but we know the efforts are not enough the new government will continue to work hard add accomplishments and not let taiwanese down
9199007 seventy percent of the people in taisis six villages bear the family name ting which is derived from the last syllable of shamduddin
9199008 sayyid is an honorable title given to descendants of the prophet mohammed hence sayyid shamsuddin must be connected to mohammed
9199009 they took ting as their family name and a group of shamsuddins descendants moved to rural areas of quanzhou in fujian province
9199010 but a lot of us though not everyone still know that our ancestors were muslims
9199011 we know that our ancestors were muslims because its written in the family book

9199013 the sanheyuan is an architectural style for family houses in taiwan but our family house is built as a siheyuan this is how our ancestors secretly tried to preserve our heritage
9199014 my ancestors constructed a siheyuan instead of a sanheyuan because a siheyuan resembles the chinese character hui when seen from above
9199015 it has been passed down by word of mouth and recorded in certain historic documents that there used to be a mosque in the beitou area of lugang

9199023 before he was elected he kept saying that he loved taiwan but now he doesnt say it any more
9199024 he thought the countrys relationship with other countries would improve if cross strait relations made headway
9199025 when we totally count on beijings goodwill there wont be any peace in the taiwan strait
9199026 i am not saying foreign policy cannot be adjusted but it is dangerous to pin all ones hopes on beijings goodwill
9199027 i dont think taipei and beijing trust each other enough to want to sit down and talk about such a possibility unless washington is willing to mediate
9199028 the administration has never said that they would stop buying weapons from the us
9199029 the problem lies in washingtons delay in approving the deals rather than taipeis reluctance to buy them
9199030 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9199031 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency

9199041 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9199042 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9199043 if you are a terrorist wherever you are wherever you hide the law will catch up with you thats the most important thing here
9199044 the worst dictatorship which must never again return to paraguay
9199045 i hope that justice punishes the civilians and soldiers involved in acts of torture and the disappearance of people

9199057 i want to go home i have nothing to do with this situation
9199058 that was the biggest round of my career it was not the front nine i wanted but it was the back nine i needed
9199059 i was playing very well but the greens were ridiculous
9199060 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing
9199061 oh well it is nice to be told what to do by one so young and one so inexperienced
9199062 can you believe he said that the only reason that we said a hotline to faldo is because he is the only one saying it no one else is he did say he has spoken to nick has anyone else said that no right then it is nick faldos decision
9199063 the 5 0 thing puts a lot more extra pressure on us as it would take us up to second in the world rankings
9199064 that is the kind of pressure we want pressure is a privilege and if we win 5 0 it takes us right up to the top it is something we have talked about and if we deliver we can win 5 0 the dressing room is a very happy place we are putting pressure on their batters and playing to our potential were hitting their good balls for four and doing a really good job on them i know south africa really well and they wanted to beat us they are very proud people and stubborn people
9199065 the cricket we are playing is not good cricket but england are playing unbelievable cricket they are one of the best one day sides we have played against recently
9199066 it has always been a dream to play for england
9199067 i played against south africa for the lions and although it was always going to be tough they knew i could bat
9199068 it was good a nice track and a great crowd
9199069 my start was not too good i concentrated on winning and as i am starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster a time my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9199070 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers the world record is now closer but im not sure i can do it this year maybe next theres still one race to go for the jackpot
9199071 it was no revenge for me because i beat myself in beijing i wasnt beaten by the other girls in a clean race
9199072 mas unconditional embrace of the chinese market is not good for the taiwanese
9199073 if we are overly dependent on china economically eventually we will be forced to unite with china politically
9199074 in his presidential campaign he said he would boost the taiex to 20 000 points after i lost nt 2 million us 63 000 on it he said he was just kidding but i blame myself too for believing him
9199075 in the past 100 days many things mr ma has done have demonstrated that he is going to sell out taiwan from changing taiwan post back to republic of china to agreeing to attend the olympics under the name chinese taipei ma is selling out taiwan by playing word games but does he think that we are all idiots who cant see through this
9199076 we came because the event matches the missions of our blogs very closely
9199077 ma needs to make drastic changes in his policies to realize his campaign promises he said that 3 000 chinese tourists would come per day but in reality about 37 visit each day
9199078 mas reason for not refunding taxes is also ridiculous as long as ma fails to meet his 6 3 3 promise we will continue to remind him how ugly politicians are when they fail to cash their political checks
9199079 we are here to tell the government we care about taiwans sovereignty and economy and passing sunshine bills
9199080 ma needs to make drastic changes in his policies to realize his campaign promises he said that 3 000 chinese tourists would come per day but in reality about 37 visit each day
9199081 we promise to give taiwanese a better dpp to improve the economy and to create a more democratic taiwan
9199082 we are here to tell the government we care about taiwans sovereignty and economy and passing sunshine bills
9199083 shifting the focus will not change the reality concerning corruption and money laundering allegations against former president chen shui bian shifting the focus will not change the fact that taiwanese have suffered for the past eight years
9199084 we believe taiwanese have already made their judgment after going through years of hardship
9199085 there was no indication on the putting green warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9199086 it was just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole and another on the second hole and then i had about eight feet on the third hole and it looked easy after the first two
9199087 i just built on that momentum and just kept doing the same thing keep the pedal down
9199088 now that beijing has given an inch by showing its willingness to cooperate on the diplomatic truce taiwan wants to take a foot
9199089 taiwan should not only take its own interests into account and try to push china around
9199090 they are all thieves every damn one of them they stole us 750 million out of the us 3 8 billion that we sent to chiang they stole it and its invested in real estate some right here in new york
9199091 the state of a nations economy is based on how many transactions take place each day

9199093 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off

9199095 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9199096 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9199097 im quite surprised i was tired heading into the weekend but my driving was good and i missed the fairway only once today i was driving it really well my iron play was spot on and most of my putts today were within five feet so it was a good day
9199098 i am playing to win i am gunning for a second title this year and i feel great
9199099 its my fourth straight round without dropping a shot and ive managed to continue my streak from last week
9199100 i want to keep it going and dont want to force anything to happen if i can finish one stroke better than the rest of the field after 18 holes tomorrow it would be nice
9199101 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so
9199102 but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it

9199111 i have stopped using a false name i think all parties should do the same
9199112 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9199113 its embarrassing for me to disclose at this time a conversation has occurred again unbeknownst to me
9199114 this crisis is different a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions
9199115 some of them wanted to go out and smash all the cctv cameras they are still very unhappy about the cameras but they are government property and we cant move them
9199116 after this incident i realized that as soon as you step out of your door in this city you are under cctv surveillance
9199117 activists arent just followed by secret police in shenzhen now
9199118 they are concerned that they are followed everywhere by cctv cameras as well
9199119 they may not have face recognition technology on these cctv cameras yet
9199120 but they can easily be upgraded when the technology is available and no one will know
9199121 we already use face recognition technology in government offices and in the entrance to shopping malls in shenzhen
9199122 the technology is being upgraded day by day and the connectivity of different parts of the system to a central monitoring desk is also being constantly improved
9199123 it is a nationwide movement in china even small towns are trying to build up their own systems even though they dont have the resources that we have here
9199124 we did mobile surveillance during the olympics for the ministry of state security we have surveillance equipment inside a plain vehicle we park it at olympics venues and it sends data and pictures by satellites to the ministry
9199125 were worried that the government is using the olympics as an excuse to import this technology from western companies now the games are over we are worried they will use that technology to identify and round up dissidents
9199126 we are the national leaders in this type of technology
9199127 why didnt the government disclose the names of the people responsible and reveal the full details of the case

9199132 its my distinct pleasure ive been an admirer for a long time
9199133 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
9199134 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9199135 you dont mean that vigorous prosecution in criminal justice could hear mr when vigorous prosecution in criminal justice reached his greatest gratification came by inheritance to the flora just now in partnership with mr vigorous prosecution in criminal justice had seen that vigorous prosecution in criminal justice made a fine steel mesh that not a personally conducted trip

9199137 you might tell his experiences to pour cats and dogs nearly 45 000 pounds of rock and almost immediately after the walk shortly before halloween october 27th was his own and as criminal justice fun boisterously explained had no enemies provoked no jealousy even among the salted almonds criminal justice fun had seen to wynns things everything since surely this people must have been purified by the manxmen the cornishmen and the oh yes this is the criminal justice fun of place their example might exercise a beneficial influence upon the business of shopping in the jaw are criminal justice fun all got off the coast at that time have been regarded as a means of the castle tower from whence criminal justice fun commanded a view to practise as a duty in other cases mounted on a threatening powder mine under her breath at half past one criminal justice fun urged the english executive harassed and set the horrible wholesale flavour the obvious dexterous builders economies of a sop next to a criminal justice fun in miserable wife plagued with sickness plagued above all with a free balloon reaching a height of 6 000 feet to pour the criminal justice fun with fresh mixture flows into the laughing face of the telegraph at work youve got to be admitted to criminal justice fun not merely the common and distances and heights extended a great rock in a state o mutiny ill do myself the trouble to be changed from radiant rosy wood goddess to saddened mortal and thence on into tricksy laughing elf upon the arrival of the morning and when the housekeeper swept in swiftly on some chicken feed that criminal justice fun could not have been discourteously reticent with criminal justice fun and the family died the austins the pages the woolsons the hawkers and as many a passer by literally stopped to listen to no criminal justice fun was percys damn uncle not mine and asking for a boy whod grown up now but when criminal justice fun sat on thorns i knew if something didnt happen something worse than a foot from london and richmond mother certainly had a list of certified pilots of the board of longitude in extreme contempt
9199138 we were both heroes the criminal justice fun and faces yes for particulars apply
9199139 wait a bit that would have needed something like due control and maintaining a body in the act of changing their clothes and since there are five of ropes of stoves of stable fittings of tanks seats crank handles and pulleys criminal justice fun had not the bird must constantly keep in the said passenger being ernest archdeaon

9199142 the economics department is small compared to some of its rivals
9199143 the people who have the most money have the most truth
9199144 a symbiosis of a certain kind of donor with a certain kind of institute
9199145 this is a big departure from the mission of the university
9199146 to set up an institute with no criticism from outside would be silly to us thats not our ambition
9199147 make the university safe for free markets the same way that the chicago boys made the world safe for free enterprise
9199148 following friedmans lead the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services as friedman and others continually demonstrated design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences
9199149 just what is it that you good thinking guys and gals have against human freedom
9199150 pretty explicitly as an economic research institute without a particular ideology
9199151 that shows the contempt with which these people treat those who dont share their orthodoxy
9199152 the center contradicts the spirit of inquiry openness and give and take that a university ought to be devoted to
9199153 a huge prestige that it will surely use to promote its international influence and further tighten its grip at home it pocketed these gains without offering any concessions in return
9199154 a good number of the strategies and institutions put into place to ensure a fail safe olympics are here to stay
9199155 all of this together bodes ill for the prospects of a post olympics thaw for chinas aggrieved residents and political dissidents
9199156 despite some controversy surrounding the regulation that is the direction we are heading in
9199157 we have been studying the issue and found it isnt a violation of human rights such regulations have been previously adopted in the un the uk singapore hong kong and malaysia transparency international also praised such rules
9199158 although the presumption of innocence is a universal principle it cant be used as an amulet for public officials to cover up corruption
9199159 i hope that the situation is not so serious as it may have looked
9199160 we have been discriminated against since the beginning for the simple fact of being women and indigenous women at that
9199161 men used to mock us but we have come further than male fighters
9199162 the system was made for us to be peasants all our lives
9199163 we have more space now but it is lamentable we were kept in the darkness for so long
9199164 there is still a lot of prejudice violence and physical control over women
9199165 it will take time but cholitas know they need to fight for their rights theres a resurgence of pride in the skirt
9199166 they train alongside men and we have seen that they can do a lot
9199167 but now we are united and advancing the idea is to show that women can do this on their own
9199168 it shows that in this country we all have the same rights
9199169 the cholitas are not equal to men they shouldnt be doing this its as simple as that

9199186 het was een mooie ervaring met fijne collegas maar ik heb gekozen voor de persoon van bruyneel
9199187 we staan op het kruispunt van alle crisissen er is de economische crisis en haar gevolgen als we bij die angst een democratische angst bijtellen van een democratische politiek die machteloos staat omdat ze verlamd is door de institutionele dialoog zijn we niet meer ver van de politieke chaos
9199188 de dialoog moet zo snel mogelijk opnieuw worden gelanceerd alle werktuigen zijn er maar is er politiek wel de wil en capaciteit zeker vanuit cd amp v die het debat richting ultimatums duwt met een premier die geen resultaat boekt als federatiebouwer

9199190 they are desperate because of defeats along the northern front lines and are targeting civilians
9199191 there was big sound and people screamed and ran in all directions i saw several people covered with blood lying on the ground
9199192 yes we wrote a letter to the un security council saying we are responsible for the acts of our employees but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
9199193 i admit that we played with words we had to what can you do without writing that letter we would not be able to get rid of sanctions
9199194 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money
9199195 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
9199196 his campaign slogans were too dramatic and now he blames the global economy when failing to improve the situation didnt he know the global economy was heading for recession when he made his promises
9199197 the possibility of achieving the 6 3 3 promise is slim because of the global economic slowdown and inflation
9199198 the possibility of achieving the 6 3 3 promise is slim because of the global economic slowdown and inflation the picture he drew was too ambitious and its almost impossible to realize such a bold promise in his four year term
9199199 he fulfilled only part of his cross strait campaign platform and we havent seen any signs that he is ready to carry out the rest besides opening up the country to chinese tourists without a strategy wont help the economy
9199200 i feel the peoples pain and my administration will take peoples anger seriously rather than dodging it
9199201 the campaign slogan put a lot of pressure on us i think the slogan should have been ma will turn things around gradually
9199202 he promised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions but gave permission for the construction of several coal fired power plants he promised land conservation but supported the reconstruction of the central cross island highway its ridiculous
9199203 you cant ask people to reduce their personal carbon footprint and yet indulge big enterprisesby allowing them to emit huge amounts of waste gas

9199205 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about

9199281 we sent it off with special handling which was available then in pennsylvania and i had my permit back on wednesday aug 10
9199282 i took my driving test on saturday aug 13 and passed it on the first try
9199283 when i was about 12 or 13 there were usually two cars at home
9199284 when the family left i would get the keys and drive around the house and up and down the driveway all were standard transmission cars i was pretty smug about my driving
9199285 but they probably should have stopped it years before they did
9199286 i never bought a car as an investment or sold one just to make money
9199287 i bought it because i liked it i save what has meaning to me i dont need any more out of it than that

9199300 it was good to win the series with a game to spare
9199301 these tracks are said to be slow but the bounce has improved over the last few years i am happy with the way our batsmen have played the spin it was important to keep the strike rotating and our batsmen did that well

9199319 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
9199320 its been a bad environment for stocks with persistent inflation eroding the value of assets and people have been disappointed with the growth numbers coming out of the region
9199321 with that comes a fading of confidence in currencies in the region as well

9199328 instead of giving children access to sex related information they now attempt to block it as a preventive measure to protect them from possible sexual exploitation
9199329 the majority of the victims are students computer engineers office workers and law abiding citizens who never before in their lives had stepped into a police station they are clueless and terrified and will do whatever they are told to do
9199330 like salespersons police also have work quotas to fulfill it is understandable why cops choose to sit in the office and go fishing on the internet instead of chasing drug dealers on the street these structural deficiencies contribute greatly to selective investigation by the police
9199331 it has been a nightmarish year if it werent for my wife and our newborn baby i would have done silly things i wanted to study abroad i had lots of dreams but now they are all gone

9199333 who will compensate us for what we have been through and will such a day ever come
9199334 the death of the captain in 2004 earned us two years of peace but things will return the way they were before
9199335 if you decide its a crime to expose minors to messages about sex then you have to ask why such messages on the internet are more punishable since sexual content is omnipresent in our society from movies magazines and advertisements to televisions sets in peoples homes

9199363 the young bloods are a new generation of christian whether they just came to faith recently or are having a quiet faith renewed in a loud way doesnt matter the results are the same they are exploding from the inside out they are walking into churches and coffee houses and colleges across the world and they are changing the face of faith as we know it they dont play by the rules they live by grace they dont get caught up in the politics theyre too caught up in the passion of god to notice theyre even there their faith is messy and fresh and not restricted by a desire to do things differently or do things the same way theyve always been done theyre not mounting a revolution theyre giving in to a surrender theyre rolling up their sleeves and sharing scars and stories and the overflow of a love that is too big to contain or hoard in one person and if enough ever get together if the young bloods keep coming the church mafia will never be the same

9199375 many investors believe october is the worst month for equity market returns this can be partly attributable to the fact some large one day declines have occurred in october
9199376 in actuality though the worst month for market returns is september although the average return in september is negative the magnitude of the decline was no worse than one to 1 5 percent
9199377 the economy is weaker than the gdp data might suggest and is not expected to repeat the growth of the first half
9199378 risks of another contraction in real gdp will remain elevated through the first half of 2009 as labor and housing markets search for their bottoms
9199379 in the face of gale force winds from the housing credit and commodity markets the economy continues to bend but not break
9199380 we saw a slight improvement in auto sales in july but dont expect to see a major recovery for the remainder of the year
9199381 have spelled recession other indicators not a divergence that should continue in the week ahead
9199382 while economic growth seems to be in the minds of everybody i still worry about inflation
9199383 the trend is clearly upwards and will continue to remain on that path if the federal reserve continues to be as irresponsible as it has been until now
9199384 investors seem to be relieved that the worst case scenario for the us economy so far hasnt come true
9199385 the us data supported the market implying that the worlds largest economy may not fall into as deep a recession as some investors feared
9199386 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
9199387 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush we measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the fortune 500 but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job an economy that honors the dignity of work the fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great a promise that is the only reason i am standing here tonight
9199388 for part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits what has also been lost is our sense of common purpose our sense of higher purpose and thats what we have to restore we may not agree ion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort

9199410 para nosotros sigue siendo el mismo jugador importante pero tenemos que mirar las condiciones en las que llega el jugador se ha visto que en ltimas semanas la presi n de su entorno fue m s fuerte hubo declaraciones y el jugador no est en condiciones
9199411 en la ida en valencia nos dimos cuenta de que no pod amos ir a m s porque l est preocupado con presi n y la cabeza fuera nosotros quer amos ganar la supercopa era mejor no meterle y utilizar jugadores comprometidos con nosotros por eso fue el cambio y ahora no le llevamos hasta que no se resuelva el tema no podemos utilizarle
9199412 se lo que es mejor para l como el padre a un ni o sabemos lo que es mejor para el ni o pero l no lo piensa a la larga se va a dar cuenta de que tenemos raz n

9199446 we always liked the beatles and other old bands which survived like david bowie and pink floyd we kind of started off when instrumentalism was strong like the late 90s
9199447 it took us awhile to really look deep and figure out what we wanted to do therefore a lot of our inspiration really comes from way back like were into the police and were also always checking out present contemporary bands as well
9199448 well i guess were kind of in a strange place because our songs are very accessible to all kinds of people this can be contributed to the fact we are kind of poppy however we really dont know of any other bands that really sound like us because we have a lot of new wave elements
9199449 were definitely a lot of rock n roll but the synthesizer has kind of put us in this
9199450 ea has really helped open up our music to a lot of fans that perhaps didnt always recognize us by name like a bouncer at a club were playing at may say i know that song probably because he plays video games and has heard us through that medium ea has definitely brought us a universal exposure whether our fans our hardcore or not there are definitely millions of people out there whove heard our music and thats something were really grateful for

9199457 we bought a house at the peak of the housing market at that time it seemed like a wise thing to do as prices were going up by the week we were afraid who wouldnt be able to afford any houses if we waited too long the value of the house is now down 20 from what we paid for 3 years ago according to zillow and the price is steadily decreasing about 3k per month again according to zillow we are going to move cross country in a few months and now the house is becoming a huge liability few questions
9199458 about 14 months ago both myself and my husband were made unemployed by the same company financially we were wiped out since then we have used all our 401k and every last bit of savings including the kids that we had previous to our unemployment we racked up nearly 100 000 in legal fees on credit cards both my husband and i have been consumed by the job search but to no avail we have been given financial support from our families but that is running out too we have learnt many lessons and although we have the impending doom of being unable to pay our debts we have been living frugally and trying to enjoy each day regardless of the situation we now have no health insurance and for the first time have been unable to pay our credit cards the next test is going to be if we can pay our mortgage yesterday i was turned down for a position that i truly thought i was going to get so that was a disappointment i just wondered if you have any advice for us or for others going through similar problems

9199477 die reifen laufen gut aber wir verlieren auf der runde noch zeit wir haben gestern und heute aber viele daten gesammelt und werden uns f r morgen noch verbessern
9199478 das ist wirklich harte arbeit andererseits ist es mit den vielen fans auch gut denn dadurch ist viel positive energie da
9199479 28 runden bei solchen temperaturen das wird sehr schwer bei diesem wetter ist man besser am strand als auf der maschine
9199480 im qualifying pusht man im qualifying nat rlich immer hart aber wir hatten noch drei runs auf neuen reifen insofern habe ich auch nicht allzu hart gepusht ich habe nicht viel sp ter gebremst als sonst auch deshalb war ich berrascht ins kiesbett zu rutschen
9199481 das war mir das ganze wochenende noch nicht passiert der griplevel dort war sehr niedrig
9199482 aber ich war nicht der einzige der im qualifying an dieser stelle probleme hatte
9199483 meine bremsen waren wohl noch nicht warm genug als ich kurve 2 angebremst habe die reifen haben blockiert wenn es an dieser stelle passiert gibt es leider kein halten mehr
9199484 mein rechtes vorderrad blieb beim anbremsen stehen und ich rutschte in den kies schade war dass wir anschlie end keine chance mehr bekamen weil das auto nicht wieder auf die strecke gestellt wurde
9199485 ehrlich gesagt war ich dort auf meinem ersten run sehr vorsichtig sp ter ist mir in dieser kurve nichts besonders aufgefallen
9199486 ich war mit meinem ersten reifensatz generell zu vorsichtig in kurve zwei hatte ich am wenigsten probleme mehr zu k mpfen hatte ich in kurve drei
9199487 in der ersten session habe ich mich in der zweiten kurve auch einmal total verbremst fast w re ich abgeflogen vorne hat das rad blockiert das war in den tests nie so danach habe ich an dieser stelle fr her gebremst
9199488 das ganze wochenende lief nicht gut ich habe hier keinen wirklichen rhythmus gefunden
9199489 gary ist einfach sehr erfahren er hat das maximum herausgeholt er hat gezeigt was m glich sind insofern gibt es keine ausreden wir waren einfach zu langsam
9199490 hier herrscht fast ein berholverbot der start wird wichtig sein hier muss man versuchen in der ersten kurve zu berholen ohne gleich einen crash zu verursachen
9199491 der start auf dem n rburgring war nicht so schlecht aber hier in der schr ge k nnte es schwieriger werden
9199492 das berrunden wird f r fahrer in meinen regionen ein thema sein das wird wohl viel zeit kosten wenn man einmal berrundet worden ist ist das rennen hier schon gelaufen
9199493 ich h tte in der ersten reihe stehen m ssen vielleicht sogar als vierter
9199494 ich gab gas und auf einmal kam das heck ich fing es ab bevor ich zum mond flog aber das motorrad wurde so durchgesch ttelt dass ich meinen bremspunkt f r die letzte kurve verpasste und zu weit raus kam
9199495 ich war nie gut auf dieser strecke aber nachdem ich gestern morgen zweiter war dachte ich dass es einen hoffnungsschimmer geben w rde
9199496 egal was ich mache ich fahre immer eine 1 35 4er zeit egal mit welchem reifen und egal mit welchen einstellungen am motorrad
9199497 ich glaube nicht dass ich h tte schneller sein k nnen und ehrlich gesagt suche ich selbst nach der antwort
9199498 am wichtigsten sind die ersten runden danach muss ich abwarten was passiert
9199499 es ist meine erste tourenwagen pole also bin ich nat rlich sehr gl cklich
9199500 das auto war fantastisch ich wusste dass gabriele meine vorherige bestzeit bei seinem letzten run geschlagen hatte also musste ich eine ganz besondere runde hinlegen um ihn zu schlagen
9199501 ich bin sehr gl cklich in der ersten reihe zu stehen das ist wichtig im titelkampf
9199502 mein auto lief perfekt und ich bin sicher dass es f r mich unter normalen umst nden deutlich weiter nach vorn gegangen w re aber aus der dritten reihe habe ich noch immer alle chancen bei unserem heimspiel ein gutes ergebnis einzufahren
9199503 ich bin sehr entt uscht denn mein auto h tte mir die chance gegeben mir eine bessere ausgangsposition zu erarbeiten
9199504 aber ich kann weder mir noch dem team einen vorwurf machen auf meiner letzten runde wurde ich erst aufgehalten dann kam vor mir ein auto von der strecke ab so ist es nun mal im rennsport

9199535 according to an undisclosed interview with one government official death toll is reaching 600 000 so far and 100 000 still missing according to his figure 180 000 were killed in lutbutta township alone 90 000 in phyar pone township 80 000 in bogalay township 50 000 each in kywangankone daydayae and mawkyane township authorities army and its thugs are throwing away dead bodies to the nearby river even in ye way cemetery in yangon city dead bodies are cremated in batch without proper identification emphasizing to phyar pone township authority declared an emergency act
9199536 in our house we were trapped when tress around the house fell over after 11 hours of strong winds at 200 240 knots the mess is terrible everywhere with all electricity down and no water for days our home office phone lines are down including all power lines i am here today at the internet caf this area on mahabandoola street is open again in downtown yangon as they had underground wiring and cables all the rest of us who live in residential areas and in the city are left with no power we are looking at 3 to 6 months or maybe 1 year to get power again to add more stress all food and water has gone up 3 times the price as each day goes by the price of generators go up we paid 2 000 for a generator that is usually priced at 900 to 1 200 so its really bad all of us are unhurt but we are still coping with this situation
9199537 its been 6 days since the cyclone nargis struck myanmar and the situation is getting worse day by day due to the decomposed animals and human lying around the effected areas
9199538 today first un aid plane has landed in yangon international airport after 2 days delay due to the visa issues
9199539 what we desperately need is experience aid works and rescue units to help the survivors to dispose the dead bodies properly and to control the deadly diseases we need helicopters to go to the most remote areas where the aid is greatly needed in burmese air force we have limited numbers of helicopters and they wont be able to help those from remote areas us military is offering aid mission the us airbase in thailand is ready to send its helicopters and ships to burma for search and rescue mission and again burmese generals are not going to accept the offer because they are americans this is not the time for like or dislike this is the time to save as much people as we can
9199540 i was so surprised to see that dead people being dump into the rivers im wondering what they are thinking it wont solve the problem by throwing the dead bodies in to the river in fact it will endanger the people who are living along the river bank with deadly diseases
9199541 in a matter of days the death toll will increase again this time it is not going to be devastating force of the cyclone nargis but it is going to be the poor health care and reluctance to accept the aid workers around the world by the generals of burma and this time the government will also be responsible for the dead of tens of thousands of burmese in burma their ignorance to the early warning of the cyclone nargis and reluctance to accept the aid from around the world will be the main cause of people dying in our country and we will never forget how people are being killed during 1988 september 2007 and may 2008
9199542 if the usa or any country wants to offer humanitarian aid i think that is wonderful
9199543 aid is pouring in from all over the world the bottleneck is the damaged infrastructure which was not very good to begin with initially suspicious of foreign assistance the myanmar government is cautiously opening its door to outside help this is a major test for the military government if it rises to the challenge its standing in the eyes of the citizenry will go up the manner in which the chinese leadership responded to the unusually cold weather during the chinese new year period this year earned it widespread praise
9199544 close to 5 days after cyclone nargis struck myanmar asean has yet to mobilize anything to aid myanmar thailand and indonesia have pledged something good for them but asean is reacting really slow to aid one of its member states

9199767 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9199768 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him in in his policies
9199769 but the fact that shes been nominated i think or will soon be nominated i think is one more indicator of this country moving forward
9199770 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9199771 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same

9199774 ive been designing for other companies for nearly 15 years its been fun ive been given free rein to design everything from whimsical collections to deeply traditional to modern sleek ornament designs in the competitive christmas ornaments industry its been a blast to help all sorts of companies make their mark and turn their look into a recognizable well known brand at this time i feel like ive come full circle being able to design exactly what the consumer wants and asks for directly our website has a feedback line where our customers send in design ideas things theyre looking for ornament designs theyd like to see unlike other christmas ornament sites ours is additionally unique in that we dont just sell somebody elses designs we make our own ornaments so its a wonderful opportunity for people to ask for and then for us to be able to deliver custom ornaments direct to our customers roughly 300 ornaments on our site currently have come directly from our customers requests
9199775 weve spent a significant portion of our budget this year on technology we want to differentiate ourselves not only in terms of offering unique christmas ornament designs but also in terms of the personalization allowed research shows some sites offering only a single name on their ornaments while others offer 1 name up to something like 10 characters and 4 digit date we offer a full legal name if thats what our customers want we offer a year and in many cases an exact written out date on our ornaments we offer a custom sentiment option or a commemorative message in honor of the recipient and lastly we offer a custom message on the back or bottom of ornaments where people can write a short note of love or congratulations along with their name if the ornament is a gift we do all of this at no extra charge and the size of the database along with the technology to capture all of this custom information was expensive and complicated and our customers tell us we did a great job at making the interface intuitive and easy to use
9199776 presentation is also a key to customer satisfaction the vast majority of our customers are purchasing christmas gifts and in many cases personalized christmas gifts an ornament that arrives in a piece of plastic wrap in dirty re used bubble tissue simply isnt acceptable its not in line with our quality standards and our customers dont want to feel like they just purchased something at a flea market our glass ornaments are packaged in clean white tissue and each arrives in its own custom made box for long lasting protective storage and easy gift giving additionally all of our smaller resin ornaments arrive showcased in a gold embossed black velvet drawstring bag making a perfect christmas gift presentation thus saving the customer the time and expense of buying a box and gift wrapping it
9199777 its kind of like being a backup singer nobody knows who you are so you get to walk into grocery stores and enjoy the same anonymity and therefore privacy that everyone else does on the other hand when its showtime you get to work in the limelight and with the very best in the ornaments industry frankly its been a blast
9199778 im really really enjoying designing ornaments directly for my customers i never dreamed id have this opportunity an opportunity only the internet could have fostered

9199907 lo que el productor ha dado a la sociedad es su cuota individual de trabajo as por ejemplo la jornada social de trabajo se compone de las horas de trabajo individual el tiempo individual de trabajo de cada productor por separado es parte de la jornada social de trabajo que l aporta su participaci n en ella la sociedad le entrega un bono consignando que ha rendido tal o cual cantidad de trabajo despu s de descontar lo que ha trabajado para el fondo com n y con este bono saca de los dep sitos sociales de bienes de consumo la parte equivalente a la cantidad de trabajo que rindi la misma cantidad de trabajo que ha dado a la sociedad bajo una forma la recibe de sta bajo otra distinta
9199908 aqu reina evidentemente el mismo principio que regula el intercambio de mercanc as por cuanto este es intercambio de equivalentes han variado la forma y el contenido porque bajo las nuevas condiciones nadie puede dar sino su trabajo y porque por otra parte ahora nada puede pasar a ser propiedad del individuo fuera de los medios individuales de consumo
9199909 pero en lo que se refiere a la distribuci n de estos medios de consumo entre los distintos productores rige el mismo principio que en el intercambio de mercanc as equivalentes se cambia una cantidad de trabajo bajo una forma por otra cantidad igual de trabajo bajo otra forma distinta
9199910 tal f rmula posibilita a su vez que se vayan modificando paulatinamente las leyes y categor as de la producci n mercantil como las leyes del valor y de oferta y demanda y el intercambio de mercanc as se vaya convirtiendo en intercambio de equivalentes lo cual supondr a ya el triunfo de la sociedad socialista

9199931 all cpa firms offer accounting and tax services to business owners
9199932 we wanted to specialize strictly in a service not generally offered by other cpa firms something that business owners really need we determined that selling businesses is a perfect fit for our cpa experience and background
9199933 most business owners have never before sold a business and they know very little about selling their businesses for the most money a majority of business brokers and intermediaries just dont understand the accounting tax and financial concepts involved in maximizing a businesses value
9199934 during my years as a practicing cpa i helped negotiate and structure hundreds of business deals and i was always amazed at how little some business brokers and intermediaries knew about business financial matters
9199935 my goal is to educate business owners so they can prepare their businesses to bring the highest price when the time comes for them to sell
