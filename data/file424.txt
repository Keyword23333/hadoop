4240083 our goal with the new quiz school was to create a youtube for quizzes of sorts said sameer bhatia founder and president of proprofs

4240095 whoever thinks the cpp will form the next government will be badly disillusioned
4240096 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4240097 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4240098 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4240099 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4240100 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world

4240125 the environment is not being taken very seriously in most of the emerging markets because we havent started feeling the pressure yet

4240130 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
4240131 a humanitarian disaster rather than a military victory was an integral part of the scenario the objective was to destroy the provincial capital while also inflicting a significant loss of human life if the objective were to restore georgian political control over the provincial government the operation would have been undertaken in a very different fashion with special forces occupying key public buildings communications networks and provincial institutions rather than waging an all out bombing raid on residential areas hospitals not to mention tskhinvalis university

4240142 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4240143 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4240144 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4240145 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4240146 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4240147 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4240148 who are open to doing something on the production side
4240149 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

4240153 the fact remains that there are iphone 3g customers in the netherlands and in other countries who believe that the user experience on this device is not enough
4240154 here in switzerland we have very mature 3g networks with excellent coverage yet side by side in the same office on the same network the iphone 3g has no 3g service while all other 3g phones have maximum signal and happily place and receive calls and dont drop any
4240155 it could be the chipset it could be how theyve implemented it there could be a lot of things
4240156 phone code is probably the most difficult to do per line of code of any code that i can think of almost everybody who has built an operating system for mobile phones it has taken them a number of years to mature it its just a process everybody has to go through
4240157 in terms of radio reception ive noticed that the iphone 3g will take longer than normal time to re associate itself and in some cases where i know theres a signal it just wont find it in some cases it has weaker reception than with other phones
4240158 i cant think of anyone i know whos less like morgan freeman than you

4240168 i still think theres more to come from michael i dont think hes back at the level he was certainly capable of being and hell get better the more he plays games
4240169 breaking it down is the only way you can get through it i think
4240170 with the injury it was hard to put a timescale on it anyway because they normally say cruciates are nine months but with having another ligament operated on as well it was too hard to tell
4240171 someone spoke to me about some northern ireland games and when we talk about ticking boxes that is the last one
4240172 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm

4240484 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4240485 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4240486 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
4240487 every soldier who refused to fight has probably saved a lot of lives
4240488 were going to be appealing to all canadians to let the government know that this kind of thing has got to stop

4240589 if they want to look at his integrity you only have to look at that first innings when ponting recalled rahul dravid because he was unsure if he had held a tough chance at second slip
4240590 that was a catch that he could have quite easily caught he was unsure whether he caught it or not and he said that and that was it end of story
4240591 i always got on really well with anil hes a great guy very reserved and i find it quite surprising that hed come out and say that

4240624 this can be determined easily by the notes we each take as we listen by our response to the person and by the instant communication at the end of the selection in other words in such a situation its great to have a discussion but its even better if both parties generally agree on what we have heard
4240625 i am hearing some great new wagner singers in cities like milan berlin london venice
4240626 it takes a long time to cultivate a wagnerian voice one that is large enough and can sing for big expanses of time the demands on the voice are incredible actually there has always been a shortage of wagnerian singers one often cant hear the potential until a singer is in his or her 30s

4240638 losing a player the caliber of bruce is tough but i think youll see boz do a good job replacing him
4240639 i think tom blake can be as productive as hickman
4240640 weve got the two tackles price and harwell but were bringing something bruce couldnt bring weve got a lot more strength than he had when he was here though were a little less flamboyant
4240641 we had a lot of injuries last year that left us with a lot of experienced guys who know how to play this season

4240648 generally the forces are starting to move out of the city particularly gori starting to consolidate their positions and get themselves into a position where they can start to back away towards the border we see that going on particularly in the areas around the seaports and around tbilisi and up north of tbilisi and west towards gori
4240649 really there has been no air activity and so we see them generally complying and moving back into a position where they can start to make their exit in an orderly fashion
4240650 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation is that clear enough
4240651 our military has nearly been destroyed from the years of trying to subdue iraq

4240655 good thing the iphone was chosen as time magazine s 2007 invention of the year because a growing chorus of discontent suggests its successor is unworthy of the honor in 2008 voice and data reception issues have been troubling the device for weeks now and it seems the blame for them lies not with the network carriers but with apple itself
4240656 in the states well placed sources have told businessweek that the infineon technologies chip apple chose for the handset is undermining its performance
4240657 and they are not the first to make such claims
4240658 so if that s truly the case what s the solution a firmware upgrade most likely those well placed sources mentioned earlier say apple and infineon are prepping one for september release

4240663 now we see georgia has found a use for these weapons and for the special forces that were trained with the help of international instructors
4240664 i think our european and american colleagues should understand what is happening and i hope very much that they will reach the right conclusions
4240665 in accordance with the constitution and the federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located

4240677 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4240678 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4240679 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4240680 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4240681 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4240682 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4240683 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4240684 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4240685 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4240686 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4240687 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll
4240688 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister

4240690 theres a time and place for everything and now is the time
4240691 i felt like there was no bigger event in hip hop at this moment than me and t i working together
4240692 it was always turmoil between our camp and his camp us as the bosses of our companies everyone is gonna follow our lead wed figure if it aint no problem and we dont have no issues no beef then theres no reason we shouldnt be able to get together and make music that was an executive decision that was made on both our behalves

4240694 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move

4240700 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4240701 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4240702 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4240703 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4240704 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4240705 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4240706 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4240707 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me
4240708 60 of the u s can stop worrying about housing market

4240723 zenn was the first neighborhood electric car that actually looked and felt and drove like a real car everything else before that was either a converted golf cart or a car that was built from the ground up
4240724 and if they do get into a collision the impact is much less severe
4240725 we would be able to sell as many of these cars as theyre selling hondas and toyotas
4240726 even if they made it a 30 000 car easily we could have toyota numbers theres enough people out there who are tired of paying high prices for gas who dont like buying and supporting foreign oil

4240730 the soi program has a three fold effect it drives aqi from former sanctuaries frees up combat power to pursue enemy fighters and offers short term employment to jump start local economies the overall impact of the program is to promote reconciliation by separating insurgents from their base of support and creating linkages between local areas the iraqi security forces and the government of iraq operation fierce thrasher for example was conducted in february in the town of durah coalition and iraqi security forces secured the city established a soi program and helped return displaced residents
4240731 moreover relationships are still in need of development between local areas the provincial government and the central government
4240732 you could eat 5 kilos of spinach and it might not have these effects we just dont know

4240743 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4240744 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4240745 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4240746 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4240747 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4240748 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4240749 a period of fasting with no food at all for about 16 hours is enough to engage this new clock

4240752 limmagine macchiettistica di gran lunga prevalente a livello internazionale il fatto che una parte consistente di italiani ha ormai familiarizzato con il personaggio politico berlusconi e unaltra parte continua a considerarlo come lemblema delle nostre piccinerie e contraddizioni
4240753 e un paese da marciapiede quello che sta consumando gli ultimi giorni di unestate allinsegna della vacanza povera caratterizzata da un crollo quasi del 50 delle presenze alberghiere nei luoghi di vacanza
4240754 dopo vari contrasti tra maroni e la russa sui marciapiedi delle citt arrivano i soldati stralunati ragazzi messi a fare compiti di polizia che non sanno svolgere neanche fossimo in angola e vengono cacciati i mendicanti senza distinguere quelli legati ai racket dellaccattonaggio da quelli veri
4240755 nella sua grottesca assurdit riuscito ad offendere un artista particolarmente privo di attitudini autoritarie un artista libero e che ci lascia liberi
4240756 no purtroppo non sono io ad arcore non ci sono mai stata e con berlusconi non ci siamo mai incrociati confesso per che non mi sarebbe dispiaciuto incontrarlo magari gli avrei chiesto un aiutino
4240757 ci tenevo a parlargli del kolossal americano che si sta preparando su san pio da pietrelcina il santuario sta a pochi chilometri da benevento zona mia ci tenevo ad illustrare il progetto al presidente e unottima occasione per la mia campania porter sviluppo soldi lavoro

4240760 serena convinzione con la quale il presidente della camera fini ha ricevuto gli atleti omosessuali
4240761 lintera materia dei diritti civili congelata per ingerenza clericale e avidit politica
4240762 al governo siedono uomini e partiti cos amanti della famiglia tradizionale da non disdegnare atteggiamenti omofobi
4240763 vorrei che la politica italiana si appropriasse del senso di accoglienza che il presidente fini ha mostrato verso gli sportivi omosessuali riconoscendo per legge il valore sociale delle persone gay lesbiche e transessuali e un impegno di civilt che la politica italiana di destra e di sinistra deve adottare contro lomofobia e le discriminazioni per lorientamento sessuale prendendo esempio dallo sport che abbatte tutte le barriere
4240764 ci sono gi forse anche generali ma penso che sia importante che allesterno non si possa capire chi omosessuale e chi no la privacy delle persone deve essere rispettata nessuno deve essere forzato a dichiararlo se non vuole
4240765 mio nonno non odiava i gay assolutamente ricordo che la mia famiglia aveva tantissimi rapporti di amicizia con omosessuali approfitto di questa occasione per rivelare che i pi grandi amici di mia zia edda erano gay

4240768 they clearly demonstrate that theres been development on the flood plain after the moratorium in june 2001
4240769 the queensland governments assured us that basically theyve approved structures because they were built before that date
4240770 but our imagery quite clearly shows that we could only find three storages and essentially there are a whole lot of channels there that have been built post 2001 and this essentially breaches that agreement
4240771 this might be the first of more developments and the paroo is certainly unique and recent reports from the mdbc murray darling basin commission show that of the 23 valleys in the mdb the paroo is the only one in good condition
4240772 so i think we should always use the paroo as the yardstick on how rivers can be preserved and maintained in good condition
4240773 we all suspect that they are bent at least on some small level at least youd hope so well why are you a policeman just to boss people around if youre on the make i might have little bit of respect for you
4240774 these words are in the dictionary i dont know how to answer this question to the jury i suppose the answer is keep talking about it

4240785 the five critical patches need to get installed as soon as possible this month
4240786 all of these patches can affect client by attack vectors that are used in day to day client side computer use visiting an evil web site or by opening an evil document

4240805 ive had my staff review this so called church and it is not on the list of churches approved by the republican national committee therefore it doesnt count
4240806 nowhere in their literature do i find the basic tenets of the christianity approved by alabama republicans either it is a democrat cult that seeks to have gay teachers disarm our youth while stepping on the bible
4240807 um i believe er the hooters name implies that this churchs members are devout environmentalists and are particularly passionate about saving owls
4240808 i also understand that their many references to wings indicate their passion for lifting people up spiritually and economically
4240809 nah see we like to go to hooters throw back a few and eat wings lots of wings and sometimes yeah we do get gas from all that but i doubt its enough to lift anyone up

4240827 president omar bongo who has the distinction of being the longest reigning president on the african continent he came to power on 2 december 1967 41 long years ago but because he has not stepped on any western interests and still allows french and other western capital to dominate his economy bongo can go to sleep if he wants as his people wallow in abject poverty and not one western government or its media will ever point one accusing finger in bongos direction

4240842 mdc supporters had burned homes of known zanu pf supporters
4240843 tsvangirais followers seem to be saying to themselves that they can win elections by beating people and by using the crudest methods of intimidation

4240857 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4240858 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4240869 although the growth in the digital media sector has been slower than expectations we are encouraged by recent analyst reports that a substantial migration of dollars being spent in the broadcasting media will be shifting toward internet based video services we believe this shift will soon result in a significant improvement in the overall sector s revenues and benefit onstream media in particular due to our strong competitive position in order to capture a significant share of this opportunity we need to both remain competitive as well as relevant with the changing requirements of this emerging market as a result beginning last quarter we increased our research and development spending in several areas to both augment our existing service offerings in both our dmsp and web communications groups and to accelerate the development of customer requested additional services strengthening our leadership position and further differentiating onstream in the marketplace this increased r amp d investment has in the short term impacted our operating results we do not believe this is a long term situation as we expect to complete a substantial portion of these new services by the quarter ended march 2009 however the demand for our rich media management expertise continues to grow demonstrating the viability of our markets and confirming that our technology is sought after by a wide range of customers onstream s proposed acquisition of narrowstep announced during this quarter represents one of if not the last key components for completion of our dmsp product line providing the top and final level of client features and services for the most advanced users of internet based video while we are not satisfied with the financial performance during the third quarter we recognize that we have made significant strategic progress and remain confident in onstream s future
4240870 our focus remains on accelerating our growth and the pieces are in place to accomplish this task the i encode product has been well received in the marketplace and we have booked several initial orders for this innovative appliance based on recent discussions we believe the order flow from the long delayed qwest networx contract appears to be finally ready to commence our dmsp segment now has more than 275 customers demonstrating growth in our sales channel which should lead to revenue and margin expansion over the next 12 months we continue to possess a stable and diversified client and revenue base with a strong recurring revenue component setting the stage for more predictable and sustainable growth as we move forward it is now clear that we will exceed our projected 40 revenue growth rate for the year and it appears that fiscal 2008 will be a record sales year for onstream
4240871 based on the record results for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 it is now clear that we will exceed our expectation of 40 top line growth for the year
4240872 we will closely monitor the short term research and development spending related to our dmsp and web communications segments and will strive to minimize the impact these additional expenditures will have on our operating results in the near term and as a result we anticipate a minimal if any burn rate in the fourth quarter
4240873 details and mechanics of how that will happen are still being worked out
4240874 people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody can get behind senator obama
4240875 of the fact that at least 45 percent of delegates were stalwart backers of sen clinton during the primary
4240876 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4240877 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

4240881 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4240882 we still dont have a motive and its going to be difficult to determine that
4240883 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4240884 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4240885 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him

4240903 night in and night out you know he is going to hit the glass knock down mid range jumpers and play defense hes the ultimate glue guy hes expanded his game to the point where he can play on the wing full time he brings a lot of attributes to the table but his biggest goal every time out is to get the victory every college program needs a tough hard nosed guy like him that will do whatever it takes to win
4240904 you must be under the mistaken assumption that im willing to listen to reasons

4240915 we encourage all nashvillians to join the many community organizations and leaders who have already taken a stand to oppose this ill conceived legislation particularly since english is already the official language of tennessee and nashville
4240916 we appreciate the leadership of mayor dean and those members of the metro council who recently adopted a memorializing resolution encouraging nashvillians to oppose the charter amendment proposal they have spoken decidedly and persistently against english only legislation due to the negative image it portrays of our great city and the high cost in dollars that nashvillians would have to bear in order to enforce comply with and defend this policy

4240938 healthy people can have reasonably satisfying sexual health for most of their lives
4240939 there are challenges that arise but its not aging per se thats the issue a decline in sexuality may be the canary in the mineshaft sexual problems may manifest before diabetes and high blood pressure
4240940 sexual health is a harbinger of physical and mental health and it plays an important role in the quality of life
4240941 older people dont just drop out of the picture in general if youre healthy you can be sexually active
4240942 dont assume that because youre older your sex life has to be gone if youre healthy and connected to someone and youve had a pretty good sex life when youre younger then you can have a pretty good sex life in old age

4240945 i want to get back on track and get back to where i was before the injury i m going to be fighting marcus hicks on september 20 in the ecc before i come back to the mfc but i m looking forward to defending my title against anyone they put in front of me i have a great relationship with the mfc i get along really well with mark pavelich they have a great organization and i was really excited to sign a new deal with them a potential opponent for hollett in his mfc return bout could be former ufc light heavyweight contender david heath who signed a multi fight deal with the organization last month while heath has voiced his desire to fight hollett as soon as possible pavelich points out that heath could end up fighting a fellow contender for a shot at hollett in the form of a possible future signing we re looking at adding another marquee fighter to the division who we may have fight heath on september 26 to see which of the two will face roger in november
4240946 let s just say it will surprise a lot of people if we sign this guy clark a veteran of the early days of the ufc is currently riding a three fight winning streak hes recently been fighting exclusively out of the courage fighting championships where he last scored a first round tko of matt kelly in june clarks mfc debut wont be an easy one as the promotion has already matched up him against rising welterweight prospect ryan ford at mfc 18 famous on september 26th call me experienced don t call me a veteran
4240947 when people call someone a veteran it means they re old and at the end of their career
4240948 sort of its summer break so my friends and i spend a lot of time playing games cause we dont have much else to do were trying to take it easy before we go off to college twister is my favorite game cause it gives me an excuse to get in crazy positions and stick my ass out in the air it always leads to me having dirty thoughts

4240990 the uk has a world class track record in scientific excellence and we want to draw on all of the expertise out there from box room inventors just starting out to the largest defence firms
4240991 the competition has been designed to provide an accessible and fun event for participants but there is a very serious point to it
4240992 we feed them every couple of days a pink liquid with nutrients not too dissimilar to what the olympians might drink for energy
4240993 it keeps the neurons alive and allows them to grow within 24 hours they make connections within a week there is a brain like activity if you stimulate one electrode you get spontaneous firing we then use that basic operation by linking it up to the robot body
4240994 one of the things we could look to do is to put sound in and get sound out which essentially means communicating theres no reason why we cant do that and i see that as something what it will mean to the neuron culture by putting audio in and getting different audio out is that it would allow us to whistle to it and teach it in some way to respond back
4240995 simply from the habit of doing things repetitively the neuron connections strengthen and allow the robot to be able to do it more accurately in terms of teaching the cells to do more that is part of the research can we get it to improve by applying different voltage and chemicals and things
4240996 we are doing that now applying chemicals to part of the brain structure so that it stops growing and the neurons will die off and then see if the actions the robot has been doing are taken over so its like looking at what happens in a stroke
4240997 can the brain learn to do things it used to do how can it learn to do the things it used to do the key thing is as we understand things a bit more is to put it into different positions or a particular situation and teach it so that we can see how the memory of what to do in that situation is constructed in the brain by the connection
4240998 brain wave vibration getting back into the rhythm of a happy healthy life
4240999 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4241000 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4241001 russia is rapidly catching up with internet and web payment technology
4241002 there are number of challenges that naturally hold back the online travel shopping
4241003 plus the fact russians still require visa to travel nearly to every foreign destination majority of customers are forced to book their trips through traditional offline agents in order to be able to apply for visa as a result of visa regulations for russians the last minute air or travel package offers are nearly non existent except for turkey or egypt tour packages
4241004 as for the russian federation local hotel bookings the general lack of technology and mentality of hoteliers in various regions result close to zero online availability of those hotels plus russian immigration rules to foreigners are making it impossible for tourists from other countries to freely travel or go for last minute travel along russian territories those potential tourists could have pushed russian region hotels with bookable online capability but that not has been the case
4241005 its clear that the share of online bookings will grow but how exactly we will know only by the end of this year when sales figures will be revealed
4241006 from this perspective the support to online travel development is tremendous though the cost of credit card acquiring is still a painful point as its 3 3 5 percent comes in with agencys only five percent mark up for the sold service such a high cost of acquiring forces online travel companies to look for alternative ways for payment settlements but obviously holds back the development of industry in general
4241007 its reflective of the concern the nepa board has for numerous transportation projects in all our counties
4241008 the character frames are actually playing much better than before but the background jittering is making is seem like there is lag when there isnt
4241009 to turn off smoothing just hold lt rt rb and lb while holding them press start and you should hear a tone indicating it has turned off
4241010 there are still other netcode improvements that have been implemented that should improve the gameplay but for some it seems the smoothing is making the game feel laggy when it isnt
4241011 we can see from this report that silver surfers are not into social media or comparison engines and are intending to spend more as the downturn does not touch them
4241012 but on the other hand a whole group of more financially pressed people who now use social media to make decisions and then comparison engines to find the best deal
4241013 complexity rules and simple strategies will fail if online retailers dont enter your comment below and press submit when complete
4241014 as a result though new parents were afraid to put their babies on their bellies at all even when awake
4241015 i see new parents all the time that by 4 months of age have never put their babies on their bellies because they are afraid the baby is going to suffocate
4241016 as a result weve seen an alarming increase in skull deformation
4241017 if a baby doesnt get early tummy time they dont push up on their elbows they dont get their heads up and looking around and they dont gain strength in their neck and back muscles
4241018 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
4241019 dont be afraid to put your baby on their tummy for short periods of time while they are awake after a nap diaper change or feeding roll the baby onto his or her stomach and encourage the infant to find focus and follow your face or a toy with their eyes looking up

4241037 la efectividad de los compromisos internacionales contra dos por m xico es relativa en efecto sus tribunales de justicia incluida la suprema corte de justicia de la naci n scjn suelen atribuir a los tratados de protecci n de los derechos humanos un valor jur dico inferior al de algunas normas de derecho interno pese a lo que expresamente dispone la convenci n de viena sobre el derecho de los tratados del que m xico es parte que proh be a los estados parte invocar las disposiciones de su derecho interno como justificaci n del incumplimiento de un tratado

4241089 people want evidence that their tax dollars and tuition money are being well used

4241098 the interests of the faculty and administrators have become primary to the accreditors and are in direct conflict with engaged reform minded trustees
4241099 the accreditors in my view are subtly blackmailing the academic institution into obedience or sanctions will be imposed the threat of a sanction or actual probation is the first tool used to keep a board under the accreditors thumb ultimately preventing the board from performing its role both as steward and visionary while addressing accountability financial and cost controls and academic excellence

4241253 we entered the first half of 2008 with a number of challenges including strong competition in the marketplace an increase in cost a decrease in export orders resulting from the anti dumping cases in korea and the us and a decreased average sales price
4241254 however we believe that fuwei films will be able to continuously utilize the current advantages and the strengthened r amp d platform to ensure our leading position in the marketplace

4241256 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4241257 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4241258 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u
4241259 the end of the second quarter of 2008 signifies a turning point for the company

4241261 the positive effects of the affiliation with rgt also enhance adeptrons sales and marketing activities and have already positively influenced our supply chain and procurement activities
4241262 we expect that the fruition of new customer relationships will have a positive impact on adeptron revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 and beyond during the second half of 2008 we will stabilize our operations to prepare for new customer opportunities as a result of being part of a global group of ems companies

4241268 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
4241269 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
4241270 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
4241271 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly
4241272 attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference
4241273 dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams
4241274 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence
4241275 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake

4241284 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4241285 we made significant progress during the second quarter reporting promising preclinical and clinical data from all of our programs including the final results of our phase 2a study with rdea806 our lead non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti in hiv patients and preclinical data demonstrating the mechanism by which rdea594 our lead product candidate for the treatment of gout patients lowers serum uric acid levels we also initiated a phase 2a proof of concept study of rdea806 a prodrug of rdea594 which should allow us to provide an early confirmation of rdea594s activity in the target population of gout patients finally we strengthened our management team board of directors and scientific advisory board through key appointments
4241286 the second half of the year should be equally productive as we plan to initiate a phase 2b clinical study with rdea806 in hiv patients and a phase 1 study of rdea594 in normal healthy volunteers we also plan to progress our 2nd generation nnrti and mek inhibitors into phase 1 clinical studies by the end of the year
4241287 these results particularly the achievement of a positive ebitda during the quarter are important because they validate the program we had set for our initial building phase which included three significant acquisitions in the last 12 months and the successful integration of these acquisitions into the bpoms model specifically the improved operating results are the result of the critical mass we are achieving through the successful integration and consolidation of our recent acquisitions additionally they position us to continue with our aggressive growth plans we have recorded large sales increases in all three business segments and during the year our human resources outsourcing component has emerged as the third leg of our service offering with the acquisition of human resource micro systems in june of last year we were able to carefully manage our cost structure to drive leverage through our operations and significantly narrow our operating and net loss the second quarter demonstrated clearly that we are on track in meeting our financial objectives and well on our way to establishing bpoms as the dominant provider of bpo services to middle market enterprises throughout north america
4241288 we expect that bpoms will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for bpo services as middle market enterprises seek the significant economic benefits our services provide this is especially the case in a weak economy where middle market enterprises in particular feel its effects and in this environment our proven return on investment and rapid implementation provide catalysts for additional business the continuing consolidation of the smaller single thread providers presents bpoms with additional opportunities to meet its growth and shareholder value creation objectives through accretive acquisitions that provide us with profitable revenue new customers in growing market verticals and additional resources with which to grow we are also targeting certain segments such as healthcare claims processing as opportunities to augment our growth objectives

4241319 there are no easy games and we know that guatemala is a very difficult team to play against at home

4241321 im glad it looks that way but it feels like im working hard on every pitch
4241322 if it looks easy maybe that gives me an advantage
4241323 whether i start the sixth or the ninth i have the same approach

4241394 this result shows the extract may have a potential use in treating obesity
4241395 however as coronary heart disease and diabetes have also been shown to be associated with higher triglyceride levels after eating we believe a food supplement based on tabebuia could reduce the incidence of these diseases as well what is more as obesity in developing countries is also on the increase such extracts taken as a capsule or added to food may be a cheaper alternative for the rural population to pharmaceuticals

4241398 this is not about khrushchev or stalin its about the future of russia
4241399 the reason these rumors persist is rooted in the fate of the country when reformers are considered to be weak and tyrants strong
4241400 i dont think khrushchev is of any interest to todays russian government
4241401 im convinced leonid was shot down and killed in the war and that he was neither a captive nor collaborator of the germans
4241402 stalin asked him to stand up and get a hold of himself
4241403 i have said everything in my book there is nothing to add
4241404 nothing happens in russia without the support of the government

4241409 when we were planning this meeting we thought it would coincide with the olympic games but sadly our event has coincided with russias military campaign in south ossietia which russian officials say is meant to save the ossetian people from genocide
4241410 genocide in fact is the perfect word to describe the stifling policies of the russian bureaucrats toward small businesses
4241411 the encouraging words and soothing promises of president medvedev about the importance of and benefits for small businesses are just a smoke screen behind which a major wipe out operation is taking place
4241412 as a result a substantial proportion of russians feel dependent on the state hence a continuing degree of support for the parties advertising social benefits and promising state support including united russia just russia and the communists
4241413 i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
4241414 hes no different from bush and bush is no different from him

4241422 in this case microsoft is communicating an issue that affects your ability to perform updates including security updates
4241423 therefore this advisory does not address a specific security vulnerability rather it addresses your overall security
4241424 an emerging theme for threats in july seems to be new variations on old attack methods
4241425 following on from june web based malware continues to be a treacherous threat and organizations would be smart to build their web security defenses in preparation for what could be on the horizon
4241426 the root cause is unvalidated input which can lead to sql injection among other things including cross site scripting passive manipulation and other things
4241427 the point is that there are tools out there such that if you point them to a web site they will try injecting sql into every web site they can find theres even a firefox extension
4241428 this is just one of several tools designed for site designers to scan their own web sites but thats part of the problem its freely available and anyone can use it the bad guys can use it just as easily as the developers themselves
4241429 developers are under pressure to release software that fulfills functional requirements security requirements are generally not part of functional requirements the no 1 rule is to release the software that does its job by this date if you cant do anything else do that
4241430 the way wed like to see development going is youd like to have a security guy involved from the beginning youd like to have developers knowing or caring enough or having time enough to test these things themselves
4241431 google sites is yet another way that spammers have programmatically defeated captcha completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart mechanisms a validation technique that is designed to defend against automated sign up tools frequently used by spammers by requiring the user to enter a string of letters
4241432 while google sites spam accounts for only 1 percent of all spam currently we anticipate that this techniques popularity will rival that of its predecessors google docs calendar and pages spam if this is the case then we may see spam levels increase in the months ahead

4241438 got a lot of folks smart folks analyzing the situation on the ground bush said today after a meeting at the cia today
4241439 i think the president wanted to stick around one more day today white house press secretary dana perino explained noting that bush has sent secretary of state condoleezza rice to the region
4241440 she is going to come back to the ranch he will take all the communications he needs with him
4241441 he had a very good day at the cia with two briefings and a chance to meet with many members of the cia perino said
4241442 he spent a little over two hours in the cafeteria he had lunch at a long table of employees who had joined in the last few years
4241443 consequences of its incursion into georgia consequences which defense secretary robert gates and rice have asserted are sure to result from the
4241444 they have shown the world that their motivations can be questioned when it comes to the region she said
4241445 there are consequences to that because there is a reputation to be managed for russia
4241446 we had a sovereign demoratic country that was invaded by russia like secretary rice said this is not 1968 and there is no place for these actions
4241447 im looking forward to hearing firsthand what she has seen what she has heard he said calling for

4241495 thinks its rielle hunter whos been dishing to the national enquirer they cite this
4241496 imagine if hunter was blackmailing edwards for money or for more money since she was already being paid a monthly stipend and if she were pressuring him by leaking information to the national enquirer and if she tipped off the enquirer to the july meeting including such details as the number of rooms rented and who was in them
4241497 i knew he was a friend of ms hunter and he asked me to come and meet with them
4241498 he said the purpose of the meeting was she was having some trouble

4241501 this is something that we talked about in the early part of the summer we knew that it was just a matter of time before we got it done i love being part of this organization and the direction that the team is headed
4241502 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
4241503 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4241504 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4241505 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4241506 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4241507 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were

4241509 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear

4241525 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

4241540 we certainly respect mr rushdies opinion but we stand by our decision which we made with considerable deliberation and regret
4241541 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4241542 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4241543 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4241544 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4241545 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4241546 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4241547 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4241548 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4241549 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4241550 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4241551 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4241552 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4241553 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
4241554 smothered the censorship struggles of the smothers brothers comedy hour
4241555 its like when an author hits with a bestseller all his earlier books sell after that
4241556 the government should fear the people theyre our servants instead we fear the government
4241557 everybody has a time to stand up and that was our time

4241562 there be no further discrimination or segregation in the pews at the communion rail at the confessional and in parish meetings just as there will be no segregation in the kingdom of heaven
4241563 set an example founded on religious principle and is responsive to the social conscience of our time
4241564 serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
4241565 the church claims no right to dominate the secular realm
4241566 as catholics we need to take a much tougher and more self critical look at ourselves as believers at the issues underlying todays erosion of catholic identity and at the wholesale assimilation absorption might be a better word of catholics by american culture
4241567 do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good acceptable and perfect
4241568 the catholic faith is much more than a set of principles we agree to but rather an entirely new way of life people must see that new life being lived they must see the joy that it brings they must see the union of the believer with jesus christ p 190
4241569 the teaching of vatican ii exists first and foremost in the council documents themselves no interpretation of the council has merit unless it proceeds organically from what the council actually said and then remains true to it
4241570 christ fully reveals man to himself and makes his supreme calling clear
4241571 we need to root the social dimension of our catholic faith and everything else we do in gods love which is the fuel for our mission of evangelization we cant offer catholic social action to the men and women of the world without at the same time offering them jesus christ
4241572 the catholic church is a web of relationships based on the most important relationship of all jesus christs gift of himself in the eucharist for our salvation none of us earns the gift of christs love none of us deserves the eucharist
4241573 what needs to be done by catholics today for their country
4241574 the answer is dont lie if we say were catholic we need to prove it americas public life needs people willing to stand alone without apologies for the truth of the catholic faith and the common human values it defends p 197
4241575 therefore put away all falsehood speak the truth each one to his neighbor for we are members of one another

4241579 hiring skilled foreign workers to fill critical shortages benefits not only innovative companies but also our economy for every foreign worker hired corporations generally hire five to ten additional american workers
4241580 immediate boost to capital expenditures and reward investments in cutting edge technologies
4241581 the additional investment stimulated by such expensing will drive economic growth
4241582 the best protection for american workers is to ensure that they have access to the worlds customers 95 percent of whom live outside the united states
4241583 this access is particularly important for workers in the information technology sector where the united states has so much to offer the rest of the world lower tariffs on american products benefit american companies and create american jobs
4241584 the greatest homage one can pay to the truth is to tell it
4241585 in coming decades many forces will shape our economy and our society but in all likelihood no single factor will have as pervasive an effect as the aging of our population
4241586 the aging of the population is likely to lead to lower average living standards than those that would have been experienced without this demographic change
4241587 each workers output will have to be shared among more people thus all else being the same the expected declines in labor force participation will reduce per capita real gdp and thus per capita consumption relative to what they would have been without population aging

4241611 average ppb print paper binding and distribution make up 26 of the cost of print books so a 20 discount isnt that far off the mark while there are savings associated with digital were also building in extra costs that we hope translate to added value for example our pdfs arent just snapshots of our print books but are bookmarked searchable and linked the addition of the additional formats epub and mobi also add processes and costs to our production group and we believe additional utility to our customers lastly the fact that customers have free access to any updated versions of the books they purchase something that isnt possible in print is a significant upgrade
4241612 during my first three weeks running slackware i have yet to find a single bug that is something ive never been able to write in a review of a linux distribution before and it is truly impressive
4241613 i should also note that slackware includes only one piece of non free software jre
4241614 to have hal correctly add and remove icons on my xfce desktop i had to create the hal mtab file in media it wasnt done automatically as is the case in most distributions
4241615 slackware does not include a display manager which allows you to choose your session at login unless you install kde as part of the initial installation process
4241616 slackware 12 1 is the first release to include hal support
4241617 its very easy to add a piece of software only to find it wont run due to some missing library
4241618 once you start adding software from third party sources this becomes particularly messy if you dont do your homework and track down all the dependencies on your own
4241619 its a recipe for dependency hell thats rarely seen on other major distributions in 2008
4241620 even advanced users will find slackware time consuming to install and configure properly
4241621 the fact that slackware is largely developed and maintained by one person and offers no commercial support makes it inappropriate for the corporate or institutional server room
4241622 the x lockup you encountered is actually a bug in the vesa driver shipped with xorg in 12
4241623 if i know what im doing in slackware it will work 100 of the time
4241624 correct because slackbuilds org and slacky eu the two biggest and most useful repositories ignoring linuxpackages net dont list dependencies right
4241625 why is it important that other distro offers insane number of packages how many of them do you use how often do you have to install them
4241626 i have to find all these dependencies blah blah blah
4241627 you probably screwed up since that most certainly isnt required you need to add yourself to the plugdev cdrom audio and video groups
4241628 theres almost always a trade off involved there making something easier for a beginner often makes it harder for an advanced user
4241629 ince slackware is maintained primarily though not entirely by one man pat must understand the entire system and how everything works together this is a benefit compared to debian etc in my opinion where incompatibilities may arise because of the high fractionation of jobs to different areas
4241630 correct because slackbuilds org and slacky eu the two biggest and most useful repositories ignoring linuxpackages net dont list dependencies right
4241631 an alternate 2 4 x kernel included in slackware 11 and 12 has been dropped
4241632 it is not what i consider to be a good distribution in its own right
4241633 slackware wasnt a good distribution for someone who wanted everything to be looked after automatically
4241634 slackware was a good distribution for those wanting extra control but only if theyre prepared to get their hands dirty
4241635 slackware was not a good distribution in its own right
4241636 and slackware will always matter as long as craftsmanship commitment and quality make a difference
4241637 there is excellent detailed well written documentation in the slackbook directory of the dvd also available online that should be more than adequate to walk a computer literate user with a modicum of experience through the process
4241638 once you start adding software from third party sources this becomes particularly messy if you dont do your homework and track down all the dependencies on your own its a recipe for dependency hell thats rarely seen on other major distributions in 2008
4241639 the comments you make about early versions of red hat linux circa 1996 1998 are certainly valid but that was a long time ago
4241640 there absolutely is extra work that you wouldnt have on slackware vis a vis dependencies
4241641 you are also correct in characterizing slackware boxes as always needing fiddling with

4241672 no puede hablarse de que colombia exporte secuestros ya que en venezuela y ecuador hay bandas mixtas de colombianos con venezolanos y ecuatorianos
4241673 la criminalidad venezolana y ecuatoriana est copiando la pr ctica colombiana

4241719 the legislation the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of 2008 establishes a temporary and voluntary program beginning in october of 2008 to allow homeowners who are unable to afford their mortgage payments to refinance into fixed rate 30 year mortgages the program would permit the federal housing administration fha to guarantee new mortgages for primary residences only if the lenders agree to reduce loan amounts to 90 of the current loan principle to be eligible homeowners must be able to afford the new mortgage must have a mortgage debt to income ratio of greater than 31 and must pay a small annual fee to the treasury department the legislation authorizes the program which would sunset in september of 2011 to insure up to 300 billion in mortgages homeowners enrolled in the program must share any future profits from appreciation in home value with the fha the bill authorizes the creation of an affordable housing trust fund that would pay for the program and would also support the construction maintenance and preservation of affordable rental housing for very low and low income individuals a separate provision of the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act authorizes states to issue an additional 11 billion in tax exempt bonds to refinance subprime loans provide loans to first time homebuyers and finance the construction of low income rental housing additionally the bill establishes the federal housing finance agency fhfa as an independent regulator for fannie mae freddie mac and the federal home loan banks these government sponsored entities gses were created by the government to finance mortgages and increase home ownership beyond supervision of the operation of the gses the new regulatory authority could establish minimum and risk based capital requirements to ensure that the gses remain sufficiently leveraged against declining market conditions the bill also clarifies the gses affordable housing goals and raises the limit on gse loans to 115 of the local area median home price with the permanent loan limit raised from 417 000 to 625 000 the interest on gse loans would be used to finance the affordable housing trust fund the legislation temporarily permits the treasury department to extend to fannie mae and freddie mac an unlimited line of credit and to purchase stock in the companies to maintain their solvency if doing so would stabilize markets and prevent disruptions in mortgage availability if this authority was assumed by the treasury department the fhfa would gain increased regulatory capacity including the power to approve executive compensation at all gses the act includes protections for taxpayers putting them first in line to be paid back if the treasury uses this increased authority further the bill grants 4 billion in community development block grant cdbg funds to states and cities to purchase and redevelop abandoned and foreclosed homes the legislation requires the rehabilitated homes to be sold or rented to moderate low and very low income individuals and families the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act also establishes minimum standards for a nationwide mortgage licensing and registration system for brokers increases the loan limit on reverse mortgages for seniors to 625 000 provides 180 million for housing counseling and enhances mortgage disclosure requirements the bill contains several tax provisions these include a temporary 7 500 tax credit for first time homebuyers that must be paid back over 15 years a temporary property tax deduction of 500 for individuals who do not itemize their tax returns and a temporary increase in a low income housing tax credit finally the act increases the federal debt limit by 800 billion to 10 6 trillion the middle class position middle class supports as many as 2 5 million families could lose their homes to foreclosure in 2008 at the same time growing doubts about the solvency of fannie mae and freddie mac threaten to further destabilize the entire u s economy congress is not acting a moment too soon the refinancing program created by the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act will have concrete results for middle class homeowners facing the frightening prospect of foreclosure although participation in the program is voluntary for lenders many are expected to participate and the measure is projected to help approximately 400 000 homeowners because the bill forces lenders to write down the principal by at least 10 the program offers a less generous bailout to mortgage lenders than it otherwise might since irresponsible lending is a major cause of the current financial and home equity crisis the effort to restrict the tax payer funded bonanza for these lenders is beneficial the 4 billion of cdbg funds authorized by the legislation addresses two important problems plaguing aspiring middle class americans the community breakdown that can result from vacant foreclosed homes in neighborhoods across the country and the lack of affordable housing in many communities middle class americans who are current on their mortgages and face no personal risk of foreclosure are nevertheless harmed when a foreclosed home down the street brings down property values erodes the local tax base and threatens to become a magnet for crime the center for responsible lending has shown that approximately 40 6 million homes will experience devaluation because of nearby subprime foreclosures that homeowners living near foreclosed properties will lose approximately 5 000 on the value of their homes and that approximately 200 billion dollars in house values and tax base will be lost from nearby foreclosures by funneling federal money to local agencies to serve lower and extremely low income individuals the cdbg funds will help neighborhoods recover from the harm done to their communities by foreclosures while helping to ensure that neighborhoods can accommodate aspiring middle class americans while the congressional budget office believes that there is a 50 or better chance that treasury will not have to use its new authority to purchase stock in the gses the enactment of this authority reassures markets that the federal government is willing to serve as a backstop if fannie mae and freddie mac continue to falter because these secondary mortgage lenders hold or guarantee approximately half of all mortgages their failure would have devastating consequences for middle class families and the american economy as a whole the promise of a bailout is regrettably necessary to prevent further market destabilization increased oversight of the gses will be crucial to ensuring that the government backed entities minimize taxpayer risk while making mortgages affordable to middle class americans standards for a mortgage licensing and registration system and enhanced mortgage disclosure requirements are forward looking measures that will help prevent the predatory lending and other improper lending practices that contributed to the foreclosure crisis

4241782 we put money in where there used to be bases before it went to the park service to be sure they were secure for the park service
4241783 why are we earmarking defense dollars for a project managed in cooperation with the national park service a project that is receiving millions and millions of dollars from the outside in a very high rent district in san francisco that doesnt seem right yet we are doing it

4241786 we will be debating later subsidies for corn cotton rice and sugar this is about subsidizing lobsters i frankly think we subsidize corn cotton and sugar far too much but lobster subsidies seem to be out of line as well
4241787 keep in mind that these are just 50 of the most outrageous earmarks from the many that were slipped into appropriations bills
4241788 mark udall has voted against eliminating earmarks where the proponent of the earmark makes a public and convincing case for keeping it
4241789 master this woman was caught in the very act of adultery

4241794 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4241795 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible

4241813 they are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4241814 they have known since the day she dropped out that she wanted this for history
4241815 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
4241816 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
4241817 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
4241818 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
4241819 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
4241820 84 and i have never seen girls that look so young but what can we do about it ask china to give us birth records no we have to take an unfair second place like mel b did on dancing with the stars

4241828 about protesting i think chinese people have experienced very little of this

4241830 diskeeper has kept my disks running effectively for years and has saved me on a number of occasions one disks worth of data saved is definitely worth my return on investment
4241831 for me diskeeper has become an indispensable tool and no server build would be complete without diskeeper installed
4241832 keep in mind that this was filmed back in the 70s back when water was still made of wood
4241833 i would have thought the council would take more care

4241851 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power
4241852 it is imperative that no eurasian challenger emerges capable of dominating eurasia and thus of also challenging america the formulation of a comprehensive and integrated eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book
4241853 how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources

4241861 the shutdown of the koeberg unit placed strain on the national power grid and in particular the western cape

4241871 the islamic revolution guards corps recently tested a naval weapon which is definitely capable of sending any warship within a distance of 300 km to the bottom of the sea
4241872 i can tell you that reports of an alleged naval blockade of iran are false

4241880 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
4241881 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty

4242089 right now were still on yellow and were still working hard
4242090 theres a little bit of caution but boy hes looking good and were excited and happy for him
4242091 ive come out a couple times and actually played defense and chased him down and made him work to explode and cut
4242092 hes really getting close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light
4242093 im not a doctor im just telling you where we are right now
4242094 hes made tremendous strides and i would think with carnell anything is possible
4242095 weve got size weve got speed weve got youth weve got a lot of talent and its up to me to get it out of them when its all said and done i hope we have some hard decisions to make
4242096 somebodys got to step up antonio bryant is doing that antonio bryant is the one guy i think from a talent standpoint and obviously now getting some experience in these last three weeks that is picking it up but we need a couple more guys to do that starting sunday i hope
4242097 hes got a lot of talent if you just watch the raw talent you see a guy with size speed and excellent hands hes learning two or three positions right now hes cross training which is really hard but im really impressed with him hes a tremendous worker and he made some plays today again that are exceptional were excited about him
4242098 its hard to imagine that at this point we are at wednesday and hes still not able to move around at full speed id like to see him start and finish a practice before we declare him ready to play
4242099 well its a good start the punt return and kickoff returns are the first play of offense we like to start outside our own 20 or 25 yard line i think we were one of the top teams in football in starting inside our 20 obviously our third down defense our punt return opportunities have to get better we still have a ways to go on our kickoff return we didnt function there as well as id hoped although it was the first preseason game thats got to be an area where we create field position we do have some dynamic returners and guys with pride and hopefully it continues to get better and better special teams coordinator rich bisaccia is one of the best in football in my opinion
4242100 he proved he can run he can catch he can block he can cover kicks hes learned this tremendously difficult offense to learn were really pleased with his abilities that he put on tape he didnt get nervous he showed real poise hes a football player that guy did well for himself
4242101 nothing really has changed here we are in the third week of training camp and youre talking about key football players rb cadillac williams petitgout galloway and garcia we miss those guys but the status hasnt changed pup he doesnt seem close to coming back on the practice field but he is working hard its a credit to him its a hard time for him
4242102 yeah yes there sure is thats why hes not active at this point in time i do know our training staff is working hard and luke is working hard the injury just isnt ready to go yet
4242103 i think hes had a consistent camp as he always does hes a guy that can play inside or outside and hes functional on any phase of special teams hes a team guy and hes a reliable football player
4242104 it is remarkable he got hurt in the last preseason game and hes had some long dark hours during the rehab lonely times but hes in a position now to reap the benefits of all this hard work and we need to see him do that come sunday night

4242170 agrium the other major potash company traded on the toronto stock exchange has increased its share price during the same period shareholders need to understand that pcs is responsible for this dispute and is in a position to resolve it
4242171 while all potash companies are usually affected by the same industry trends the discrepancy between pcs and agrium suggests that the strike is impacting pcs share prices
4242172 pcs management has drawn an arbitrary line in the sand
4242173 pcs shareholders would be better served if management made a reasonable offer to get union members back to work
4242174 some analysts have suggested that the strike will increase potash prices compensating pcs for the lost volume however a more realistic assumption is that pcs was producing the profit maximizing volume of potash before the strike

4242180 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4242181 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy

4242316 i think matts definitely closing the gap theres no doubt about it
4242317 i think hes really been pushing brian here probably about the last eight to 10 days
4242318 i think matt is getting more comfortable brian was more comfortable quicker in the earlier part as far as the otas understanding what were doing i think theyre both good young prospects
4242319 just looking at their grades they did a number of positive things in the game
4242320 they did not have winning performances is the way we look at it and its just a number of things we need to clean up
4242321 ive said it time and time again those guys need to play we knew this was going to take probably the full preseason to get those two guys ready and we feel like were on course to get that done
4242322 the things that always stick out in my mind are mistakes
4242323 i could have made a couple of adjustments on protections that would have helped out and not got me sacked on the first play just the little things reads being quicker with decisions and things like that
4242324 i came in here and i didnt really know what the situation was going to be or what its going to be like at the end of camp its one of those things that i am going to go out and play as hard as i can and just let the coaches do their job
4242325 i look at it like i have an opportunity to come in here and learn how to play the game learn from some great coaches learn from aaron and do the best i can and take advantage of the opportunity
4242326 overall i felt like i did a pretty good job of just the mechanics of the offense getting in and out of the huddle

4242328 weve kept them the same as far as going through the installation phase
4242329 brian took the reps of the no 2 and matt took the reps of the no 3 based on the period 3 2 1 is the ratio sometimes it was 4 2 1 as far as the starter now once we got into this in season schedule they split the opponent reps and brian is still getting a little more work than matt
4242330 i dont know if you drew it up like this is the way you would do it but this is the way it is
4242331 we like our two young guys and we think they are on a steady path here quite frankly our coaching staff likes working with them so we feel pretty good

4242410 the basic workings of a democracy depend upon the integrity of its government adherence to the rule of law is a foundation stone upon which any civil society is built it is especially vital that we as a nation keep elections clean by allowing qualified citizens to vote by not suppressing voting through intimidation or arcane rules by not using the instruments of the state to influence elections and by allowing proper tabulations of all votes cast its for these reasons that i am so thoroughly disappointed by the u s department of agricultures approval of a 3 million egg industry advertising campaign in california by the american egg board between now and election day the very period when the proposition 2 campaign to phase out battery cages for laying hens and also to phase out veal and gestation crates is at high tide californians for humane farms the political committee backing prop 2 that hsus actively supports filed a lawsuit in u s district court in san francisco yesterday to challenge this federal action
4242411 truth stands the test of time lies are soon exposed
4242412 the young girl is a hero in san francisco and understandably
4242413 we will try to make the neighbourhood healthier its a very inclusive approach
4242414 if greenlit is a sure fire hit for fan boys but in scale its big very big and we are hearing rumors that it may be too big for the director currently attached greg berlanti but who would the studio trust to take on a franchise of this size
4242415 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4242416 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force in this situation
4242417 russias behavior over the past week called into question that dialogue
4242418 they have taken our passports this is a reflection of their insincerity
4242419 they want to talk to us yet they behave like hooligans
4242420 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4242421 in case of any attacks against iran we will not remain idle because any blow to the islamic republic is in fact a blow the worlds deprived nations
4242422 we have learned the lesson of allegiance from the late imam khomeini school drawing on this lesson we say that we will not leave the iranian nation alone this is a word pledged by any fighter for the cause of god
4242423 i would say 110 is where it might go something like that
4242424 got a lot of folks smart folks analyzing the situation on the ground bush said today after a meeting at the cia today
4242425 i think the president wanted to stick around one more day today white house press secretary dana perino explained noting that bush has sent secretary of state condoleezza rice to the region
4242426 she is going to come back to the ranch he will take all the communications he needs with him
4242427 he had a very good day at the cia with two briefings and a chance to meet with many members of the cia perino said
4242428 he spent a little over two hours in the cafeteria he had lunch at a long table of employees who had joined in the last few years
4242429 consequences of its incursion into georgia consequences which defense secretary robert gates and rice have asserted are sure to result from the
4242430 they have shown the world that their motivations can be questioned when it comes to the region she said
4242431 there are consequences to that because there is a reputation to be managed for russia
4242432 we had a sovereign demoratic country that was invaded by russia like secretary rice said this is not 1968 and there is no place for these actions
4242433 im looking forward to hearing firsthand what she has seen what she has heard he said calling for
4242434 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4242435 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4242436 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4242437 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4242438 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world

4242443 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4242444 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4242445 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4242446 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4242447 the redeployment of the armed forces that both countries have agreed to will be complete before the meeting of foreign affairs ministers in hua hin thailand

4242465 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
4242466 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
4242467 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
4242468 we are working with the uk bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
4242469 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
4242470 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
4242471 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk
4242472 significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties

4242492 the chinese government should immediately release ji sizun and anyone else detained by police while trying to exercise their basic rights
4242493 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
4242494 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
4242495 nobody should confuse the lack of protesters with a lack of complaints
4242496 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views

4242498 during many ages there were witches the bible said so the bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live therefore the church after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for 800 years gathered up its halters thumbscrews and firebrands and set about its holy work in earnest she worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned tortured hanged and burned whole hordes and armies of witches and washed the christian world clean with their foul blood then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches and never had been one does not know whether to laugh or to cry

4242511 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4242512 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4242513 while some of them live paycheck to paycheck our customers represent broad income segments and they are all challenged today when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and health care and core food items there is a great deal of pressure on the customer
4242514 we have improved customer traffic and ticket and overall sales growth in our markets

4242517 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4242518 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4242519 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4242520 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4242521 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4242522 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4242523 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4242524 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4242525 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4242526 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4242527 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4242528 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4242529 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4242530 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4242531 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4242532 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4242533 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4242534 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4242535 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4242536 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4242537 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4242538 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4242539 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4242540 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4242541 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4242542 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4242543 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4242544 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4242545 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4242546 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4242547 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4242548 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4242549 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4242550 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4242551 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4242552 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4242553 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4242554 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4242555 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4242556 the three actors were totally heroic coming in this doesnt happen very often where theres a tragedy like this and very famous very successful actors suddenly say okay well do whatever it takes to help they came they did the work they allowed the movie to be finished they didnt take money the money goes to heaths daughter thats extraordinary and wonderful and when youre part of that you think ah this is maybe why i went into the movies in the beginning i thought it would be full of wonderful people and in our case weve got a movie full of wonderful people who did extraordinary things to help
4242557 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4242558 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4242559 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4242560 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4242561 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4242562 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4242563 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4242564 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4242565 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4242566 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4242567 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4242568 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4242569 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4242570 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4242571 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4242572 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4242573 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4242574 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4242577 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4242578 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4242579 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4242580 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4242590 the principles of risk management are well in place at the existing exchanges they can easily implement this
4242591 rbi does not want to bring overseas volatility to india that is why overseas participants are not allowed right now
4242592 when equity derivatives and demat were implemented some people had reservations but everything went on smoothly
4242593 how to reconcile these two markets will be a major challenge before the regulators and the exchanges
4242594 you can quote any date or volume you want you can talk about exchanging underlying delivery also so the big fish will continue to use otc
4242595 banks which have derivatives on their books can trade their residual position in currency futures
4242596 i decided immediately that it was my responsibility to put together some kind of a tribute film for family and friends as i was the only one in the world who could
4242597 and then it occurred to me i was never going to get to visit him at his hospital to see what he was like as a doctor id never be meeting the rest of his family and friends at his wedding so i expanded my tribute film into a quest to visit the places that were sacred to him to meet and interview everyone who knew and loved him since his friends were scattered far and wide it would be a road trip of epic proportions it was my grieving process
4242598 i suddenly realized that my responsibility here was now much bigger
4242599 andrew was going to have a son born after his death who would never know him and i might have the only means of introducing him to his father at my fingertips
4242600 at a certain point the enormous injustice of what was being allowed to happen here an accused murderer walking free with a baby my friends grieving parents being tortured emotionally on a daily basis by the government of canada which allowed this situation to exist multiple lives being recklessly endangered it all came to a breaking point one day when both i and andrews parents decided there was no other choice but to take the gloves off and go public
4242601 quit playing poker forever right now and ill give you a pot of gold worth a million dollars

4242607 that bastard husband of mine wanted me to sleep with the landlord because he lost the rent money playing poker
4242608 i have to admit i did though with certain misgivings i might add what i havent done though is tell my husband the rent is paid up for six months
4242609 lord forgive me for what i am about to do
4242610 every time he gets a good hand he wags his tail
4242611 this is a terrible time to be trying to sell a newspaper the sales value of newspapers has probably dropped in half in the last five years there are a lot of newspapers that are up for sale and there are no takers or no one willing to pay what the sellers want
4242612 i get to work with amazing business owners who have shared their trade secrets with us
4242613 but its a rollercoaster when you get into business you just dont know what to expect
4242614 its the most cost effective marketing tool you can have its the first time in history that you can communicate with the entire world in an instant
4242615 i dont want to call it an oscar but its nice to be recognized for excellence in our field
4242616 it takes people from where they are to where they want to be
4242617 we have these denial potholes theres a big difference between what people think they eat and what they actually eat
4242618 the coolest thing for us is to be a part of our clients success
4242619 i love the new relationships and the instant gratification behind the creative aspect of what we do
4242620 as a result of this weeks events the excitement that many of you felt about the show has turned into dissatisfaction and disappointment
4242621 due to these circumstances weve reevaluated our convention hall space and come up with some solutions that will allow us to offer 3 000 more tickets for sale
4242622 to avoid the issues many of you faced this week well be selling these 3 000 via a lottery
4242623 i think there was a general realization that these areas do deserve protection
4242624 thats exactly what the state of idaho and now the forest service are doing
4242625 well hes got no assets at all so i dont know how it could happen
4242626 he picked the wrong friends every friend he took all of a sudden is in a situation where theyre doing bad things and hes in the middle and he got suckered in just like everyone else was he doing something criminal of course he was thats what hes being sentenced for what he did he just has the wrong choice of friends all the way through
4242627 this lawsuit just never made any sense saudi arabia kicked osama bin laden out of the country and revoked his citizenship
4242628 i just dont know how the sept 11 victims get their day in court to hold saudi arabia accountable
4242629 i have a lot of respect for this panel of judges but this ruling is off the wall
4242630 its extremely disappointing given that a saudi official can be sued for unintentionally injuring someone in a car accident in the u s but not for the intentional murder of 3 000 citizens
4242631 wed be ready to go to trial once we got even a modicum of discovery
4242632 and i have no doubt what the end result would be
4242633 either way the supreme court goes with fsia we win in the end
4242634 el viento ha llorado esta noche crear nueva entrada wordpress
4242635 we certainly recognize that the nickname mexicutioner is out there
4242636 but from what i understand whb cant and hasnt taken ownership of that nickname our feeling is that joakim soria is the perfect player to honor with a t shirt giveaway and the timing has to do with the success of his season and making the all star team
4242637 its time sacramento had a mayor that recognized that and is willing to roll up his sleeves and make education our top priority
4242638 the question continues to be are there republican votes for it
4242639 it isnt exact thats one we talked about it has to be exact
4242640 to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth
4242641 hey ive been hearing what youre telling people and i want to know more about this what can i do
4242642 we are excited to begin the next phase of qualifying
4242643 there are no easy games and we know that guatemala is a very difficult team to play against at home its important that we start off the semifinal round in a positive way and we are confident the work from the last 18 months has prepared us for the task
4242644 in the first half of this year more than 10 percent of visitors were international we hope we can gradually raise this for over the long term macau ought to develop the international market
4242645 obviously from a strategic point of view we feel this is a very good moment for us to not just pursue quantity but also to give a very good look at the quality of what were providing
4242646 strategy wise its very important for us to go for diversity
4242647 diversity in terms of product and diversity in terms of the markets we are pursuing so international markets will be very important in the future
4242648 with macaus improvements in terms of the number of hotels we can offer in terms of the transportation reorganization in actual fact the carrying capacity also changes over time
4242649 pemimpin pas bertemu dengan pimpinan umno adalah restu daripada majlis syura ulama dan rundingan yang diadakan
4242650 tetapi apa yang kita lakukan untuk memastikan mereka menerima islam
4242651 perlukan kepemimpinan ulama hanya mengutamakan pandangan aspek politik semata mata dan meninggalkan perkara sebenar dalam dakwah
4242652 sayangilah jemaah dengan panduan al quran dan bukan sahaja dengan kepentingan politik
4242653 pastikan segala langkah yang diambil oleh ahli mestilah berdasarkan panduan dari al quran
4242654 en materia de secuestro colombia es superada ampliamente por pa ses como m xico irak brasil venezuela y ecuador
4242655 en venezuela y ecuador ha aumentado el secuestro mientras en colombia ha disminuido bastante el n mero
4242656 la problem tica del secuestro en m xico est estrechamente relacionada con el surgimiento de la mafia de las drogas y la criminalidad organizada
4242657 es un efecto secundario de la alta tasa de criminalidad de las grandes ciudades
4242658 algunos pudieron haber muerto tenemos que cuidar que esos grupos de secuestrados no caigan en el olvido
4242659 vivi una verdadera ola de secuestros entre 1995 y 2001 que lleg a 3 706 casos en el 2000
4242660 los grupos armados ilegales recibieron desde 2002 menores ingresos provenientes del secuestro
4242661 no puede hablarse de que colombia exporte secuestros ya que en venezuela y ecuador hay bandas mixtas de colombianos con venezolanos y ecuatorianos
4242662 la criminalidad venezolana y ecuatoriana est copiando la pr ctica colombiana
4242663 ya no es la gran fuente de recursos sino que est afectando m s a la clase baja la guerrilla sigue secuestrando pero est bastante debilitada
4242664 tiene que buscar una salida pol tica al conflicto armado y eso incluye la pr ctica del secuestro
4242665 las unidades antisecuestro venezolanas no est n lo suficientemente equipadas
4242666 callados los 700 que estan en manos de los paramilitares sino estan ya vueltos picadillos y el resto de secuestros cometidos por los otros delincuentes miren pdentro que se van a quedar ciegos
4242667 the plaestinians mayknow what their property is by how would the jews know
4242668 saya mencadangkan supaya negeri negeri ini mewujudkan koridor kuasa pr bagi memperteguh urus tadbir kerajaan dan pengurusan ekonomi
4242669 hasil bumi yang kaya ini mesti dimanfaatkan secara terancang untuk kebaikan bersama jaringan kerjasama ekonomi dan persefahaman politik mesti dibuat dengan segera
4242670 saya menggesa supaya sebuah jawatankuasa pemandu pr di peringkat pusat diwujudkan supaya dasar dasar kerajaan pr dapat diselaraskan agihan sumber dan rancanganpembangunan bersama juga dapat diaturkan sehingga kita dapat menanganisekatan politik dan ekonomi yang dilakukan oleh kerajaan pusat ke atas limabuah negeri ini
4242671 jawatankuasa pemandu ini perlu berperanan agar lima buah negeri pr ini menjadi satu persekutuan yang saling bahu membahu dalam mengekalkan keyakinan dan kepuasan rakyat
4242672 kita mesti menghormati dasar dan tujuan perjuangan rakan rakan kita tetapi dalam masa yang sama mereka juga harus menghormati kita jika kita saling mempersoalkan dasar orang lain maka selagi itu pakatan ini tidak akan kukuh
4242673 islam yang didukung oleh pas tidak pernah menzalimi atau menganiayai sesiapa termasuk bukan islam bahkan islamlah satu satu sistem pemerintahan yang telah terbukti memberikan keadilan kepada semua manusia seperti yang terakam dalam sejarah khulafa
4242674 pas berdiri tegak dan teguh sehingga hari ini kerana perjuangan islam yang dilihat dan diyakini konsisten dap terus relevan di persada politik kerana nilai dan prinsip social democrat socialistic inclination yang dipertahankan manakala pkr terus mara dengan slogan keadilan untuk semua
4242675 saya mengajak pimpinan pemuda pr melangkah ke hadapan dengan nilai sejagat perjuangan ini serta membuktikan kepada malaysia dan dunia bahawa kita mampu merealisasikan citi cita perjuangan kita dengan penuh tanggungjawab
4242676 saya tidak rela untuk terperangkap dan terjerumus dalam jebak dan konflikpermusuhan yang tak kunjung sudah yang mengheret kita pemuda pr untukterus bersangka buruk dan membiarkan minda rakyat terus dibelenggu olehmomokan dan persepsi pas dengan islam yang ganas serta dap dengan sikapchauvanisnya atau parti perkauman cinanya
4242677 telah sampai masanya kita pemuda pr memulakan era baru dengan menamatkan konflik ini secepat mungkin
4242678 gelanggang ilmu persada pengetahuan dan pentas diskusiintelektual mesti disuburkan untuk kita mencambahkan politik berasaskan ilmu k politic bagi kita mewajahkan semula perjuangan pr yang lebih menyakinkan politicians think for the next election statesmen think for the next generation

4242682 label you these days so i took a deep inside look at my life and what has recently transpired needless to say i was not pleased and it wasnt my actions that made me feel this way
4242683 if your not getting what you want outta life than instead of blaming things on others maybe you need to take a look at yourself
4242684 you have to shower here before you leave theyre great
4242685 its four days away and theres the usual uncertainly built around that
4242686 we are definitely not off the hook with this system
4242687 if we have a tropical cyclone that close we would feel some of the effects
4242688 they took the entire matter out of context in my mind and i worked for the press tribune for four years
4242689 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4242690 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4242691 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4242692 i like this course its a great course but at the same time its really difficult
4242693 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4242694 bad vanessa stay in the present the present is the only moment that matters
4242695 you may have to tend to a few of last weeks issues before the coming workweek is upon you you dont want to trip over loose ends
4242696 typobounty is a unique advertising venue for small business because no ad is pushed aside by big money accounts since visitors come looking for ads they arent deterred irrespective of how deep in the site an ad exists
4242697 if your mind is calm and smooth it will go right into your hands
4242698 pro golfers arent thinking about getting this on the green or even close theyre trying to hole it
4242699 also the senator typically hits the treadmill before embarking upon an average 16 hour workday and she doesnt even own a rocking chair like the ones used by the men appearing in the ad
4242700 i dont think we should leave here this week for a monthlong recess until we have dealt with the single most important problem facing american people today and our economy high diesel
4242701 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4242702 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4242703 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4242704 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4242705 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4242706 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4242707 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security
4242708 on this anniversary lets make sure john mccain hears the same message tell john mccain to keep his hands off of our social security
4242709 well tania youve designed fliers brochures collateral magazines but youve never designed a website i wonder if you could do that
4242710 lets see what would be a fun thing to work on to test your design skills something that has no real deadline and isnt something that is so serious that the world as we know it would end if it turns out that you suck at web design
4242711 oh i know how about that crazy idea you had in school about providing people with lets see what should we call it personal paparazzi
4242712 i dont think any other company but verizon wireless could have bought alltel and taken it to the next level
4242713 were not the kind of company that takes our profit and goes home
4242714 the reality is we are going to lose a fortune 500 headquarters here
4242715 est configurado que o senador abusou de suas prerrogativas de forma eleitoreira e que de forma indireta contribuiu para a morte dos tr s jovens no morro da provid ncia

4242718 facebook is already a place where people are acting on their interests and ideals connecting with each other and sharing information that can lead to meaningful change
4242719 through this partnership with servicenation we can be part of an historic effort to inspire americans to act together to get more directly involved in and connected to their real life communities
4242720 facebook has itself made history by helping millions across the world to come together by connecting and communicating in an easy to use state of the art online environment
4242721 using facebooks highly regarded organizing tools we hope to channel the idealism and energy of our citizens into real world action that can promote the ideal of voluntary service
4242722 the good neighbor awards is our way of thanking our most outstanding realtor r volunteers who are not only making a difference in the lives of many but also are helping build stronger healthier communities
4242723 we are extremely proud to recognize these finalists and are truly inspired by their enthusiasm and commitment to giving back to the communities in which they live and work
4242724 the good neighbor award finalists exemplify the good deeds and community building efforts of realtors r across the country and deserve to be commended for their outstanding contributions to our communities
4242725 these realtors r are truly role models and i hope they motivate and inspire others to volunteer their time and talents
4242726 though we sympathize with the airline industrys needs to cut costs and raise revenues doing so on the backs of those who seek to protect us is ill conceived
4242727 if the airlines refuse to waive baggage fees at the check in desk we would like to suggest that you develop a system to bill directly to the department of defense so that soldiers going to war dont have to concern themselves with whether or not their reimbursements went through
4242728 we know you understand the financial burden that service members and their families often face they may not have the extra money to cover the fees up front
4242729 we believe that our service members have more important concerns than paying baggage fees keeping track of receipts and hoping for an eventual reimbursement
4242730 its good to see american airlines has done the right thing hopefully the other airlines will follow suit
4242731 i really think it demonstrates that the time for solar has come its not some small niche thing anymore for rooftops
4242732 as costs have come down the cost of alternatives have gone up so were rapidly reaching a tipping point
4242733 probably have people falling off their chairs from osaka to madrid
4242734 but its very visually unobstrusive said randy goldstein optisolars chief executive officer
4242735 the modules are fixed in place and are three feet off the ground it almost looks like a lake
4242736 it does say the building has to be vacated as soon as reasonably practical not to exceed 30 days
4242737 you know how difficult it can be sometimes to move in and out of buildings when youve got your friends helping you and to coordinate all that
4242738 to do this knowing that the building is going to be ordered closed is unconscionable
4242739 seagate has already made its intentions about jumping into the ssd game pretty clear and one analyst now says he sees two clear options at the companys disposal if it wants to seriously make a go of it each of which involve seagate shelling out a good chunk of cash according to lazards daniel amir one option would be to buy out intels 49 stake in the im flash technologies joint venture it has with micron which would reportedly cost anywhere from 1 to 2 billion not to mention put seagate on the outs with intel more likely than that amir says would be an acquisition of or partnership with sandisk which he says would be an ideal fit given seagates expertise on the enterprise side and sandisks retail knowhow amir doesnt put a price tag on that option though but you can be sure it wouldnt be cheap
4242740 twitter has killed its outbound sms services outside of the united states canada or india and with it a potentially highly lucrative business model in europe in the uk youll still be able to send twitter an sms to update your status but you wont be receiving them apparently rising rising costs made it impractical and we have been getting those smss for free
4242741 this year we are exploring the needs of not only the defense establishment but of those facing civil aviation authorities and commercial service providers as well
4242742 when you talk about focusing on the big picture this is it
4242743 weve worked hard to create a forum that takes a more detailed look at the real issues facing those charged with trying to evolve defense and civil agencies into net centric frameworks
4242744 it makes no sense to compare across the board averages of public sector and private sector salaries would people be surprised that people who work in the high tech sector make more than people who work in construction
4242745 its the most comprehensive measure of compensation in the federal versus private sectors
4242746 in the face of largely static benefits for federal employees there is unfortunately ample evidence of significant private sector cutbacks in employee benefits health insurance and pensions just to name two playing a substantial role in any such comparison
4242747 on the whole federal workers perform work that is of a higher level and complexity than the average private sector worker
4242748 the government jobs that remain are highly skilled and increasingly specialized and they are properly classified at higher grade levels grades gs 11 to gs 13 are the most common
4242749 this is becoming a consistent but misleading analysis by the bureau of economic analysis which unfortunately is fueling business friendly special interest groups like cato to advocate for costly federal contracting schemes
4242750 i believe that residents deserve an elected officials undivided attention and due to greater responsibilities at work and increased travel commitments i can no longer give the position the time and energy required
4242751 his measured judgment on issues from the audit committee to finance to zoning meant he was well respected among his colleagues
4242752 we appreciate his service to this community he will be missed
4242753 they have pretty limited knowledge they are big tall pretty pretty girls who are quite naive
4242754 on three different occasions they went out without permission and they never came back on their own
4242755 not in the best interest of a community that prides itself on providing a healthy family environment
4242756 was for the purpose of capturing hoving on film and recording him saying or doing something that would amount to misconduct
4242757 command the states officers or those of their political subdivisions to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program
4242758 do not have jurisdiction in my county unless i grant it to them
4242759 i am reacting in response to the actions of federal employees who have attempted to deprive citizens of my county of their privacy their liberty and their property without regard to constitutional safeguards
4242760 i hope that more sheriffs all across america will join us in protecting their citizens from the illegal activities of the irs epa batf fbi or any other federal agency that is operating outside the confines of constitutional law employees of the irs and the epa are no longer welcome in bighorn county unless they intend to operate in conformance to constitutional law
4242761 if a sheriff doesnt want the feds in his county he has the constitutional right and power to keep them out or ask them to leave or retain them in custody
4242762 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
4242763 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
4242764 you cant understand how a woman seeing a man who has been separated from his wife for months can cause such a scandal its awful i cant tell you you wonder when its all going to stop
4242765 thank goodness some people are seeing the hypocrisy of it all i know it makes sienna pleased to read these things it means a lot to her when theres so much negativity and criticism around
4242766 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4242767 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4242768 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4242769 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4242774 a sense of solidarity has developed among louisvilles arts community
4242775 people here have something to prove and there is a real interest in making louisville a great place for artists to be
4242776 they show a lot of support for and interest in regional artists not just internationally renowned names
4242777 here i can just hop in a car and be at a farm in 20 minutes
4242778 for its size has a lot of young energetic civic minded self starters who want to take the ball and run with it and really make an impact and in this town that is possible
4242779 on a recent visit i decided to take a look around and see what louisville had to offer not expecting much besides maybe some very nice quilts and paintings of horses in the same way as expecting to find art galleries full of paintings of sailboats in new england towns
4242780 who knows what will happen in a year from now
4242781 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
4242782 most of the effects of low oxygen on fish stocks are what we call sub lethal
4242783 it doesnt kill the fish but stresses them it affects their growth it reduces their reproductive output and makes them more susceptible to disease
4242784 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome

4242865 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4242866 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4242867 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4242868 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4242869 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world

4242903 we may now see why if life is a problem its solution is a faith we cannot solve life by moral thought or effort but by trust which unites us with the invincible eternal moral act of god in christ christianity is not the sacrifice we make but the sacrifice we trust not the victory we win but the victory we inherit that is the evangelical principle we do not see the answer we trust the answerer and measure by him we do not gain the victory we are united with the victor faith is not simply contact but communion we do not simply refer our souls to christ we commit them and to commit our souls to christ is to confess the godhead of christ it would be idolatry to commit our eternal soul to one who differed from us but in degree christ crucified and risen is the final eternal answer to the riddle of life one day when we sit in heavenly places in christ we shall see the tangle of life unroll and fall into shape we shall see death as the key of life our own dead could tell us so already we shall we guilt destroyed and with that death wrong darkness and grief
4242904 that god spared not his own son is a greater shock to the natural conscience than the collapse of civilisation in blood would be for civilization may deserve to collapse if only because it crucified the son of god and crucifies him afresh but if god spared not his own son he will spare no historic convulsion needful for his kingdom and if the un spared son neither complained nor challenged but praised and hallowed the fathers name we may worship and bow the head

4242957 i guess i was just remembering things and so much involved in my thoughts that i didnt hear you what were you asking me
4242958 i was about to ask if you really remember grandpa sullivan hes been gone now for about eight years you must have been around eleven or so when he died what do you remember about him
4242959 yeah i remember some stuff like christmas you remember how we always had to go to grandpa and grandma sullivans on christmas day every year
4242960 i always wanted to see my family at christmas chauncey never seemed to care about seeing his side of the family but it was really important to me so what do you remember most about christmas at montezuma
4242961 i never liked to come here to ohio for christmas to be honest about it
4242962 well you and dad always gave us a great christmas lots of toys and good stuff we hated to leave it all behind for the day when we had just seen it for a few minutes then too we knew grandma didnt have much money and couldnt get us much of anything so we spent the whole day here with nothing great to do some years grandma sullivan gave us a hanky apiece with maybe the three little pigs on it or something like that
4242963 of course grandma lewis never gave us anything not for any special days
4242964 maybe i was the selfish one dragging you boys out every time i wanted to make the long trip from st leon to here
4242965 are we about ready to head back now i still have to do the milking and things before too late
4242966 ive been wondering how to tell something to you and to your brothers and chauncey
4242967 i think ill be back here again next week to take grandma back to live with us
4242968 you heard what ruth said didnt you you know a little about grandmas condition after what ruth told us i just have to do something to help grandma
4242969 can you really swing it i mean dad will err where would you put her and who would take care of her i mean you and dad both work second shift
4242970 mom if theres no one else in the family to take her in i guess i can try to be a help somehow if theres something i can do still i dont know what it would be at least not right at the moment
4242971 youve got your life to live robert i cant expect any of you boys to take care of my mother i have to talk to chauncey and try to work out a plan
4242972 wed better go back to ruths and say good bye and be on our way youve got the milking to do and probably a date with sandra again tonight right
4242973 mom you told me a few days ago that maybe god was trying to tell me that i shouldnt be seeing her anymore remember the tight chest and the breathing problems i was having
4242974 sandra is not interested in god or church i dont want to talk about it but shes wanting to carry on in ways that i dont think the lord approves my pastor sometimes mentions the problem of going to places that ive sometimes gone with her i dont feel good about it
4242975 its off im sure god has a better choice for me and its ok i do like sandra but i love god and dont want my life to displease him
4242976 its called have we no right its really supposed to be a missionary book but it deals with the day to day life of any christian this book got me to thinking you know i started out a little over a year ago to be a christian some of the people at the friends church looked at me sort of funny or at least i felt they did when i went up to the altar that sunday morning they treat me ok but i think some of them think im going off on the deep end that im too christian i hope they dont feel that way but i think a couple of them do
4242977 i didnt think anyone felt that way who are they
4242978 no if im wrong i wouldnt want to have you feeling bad about someone and for sure i wouldnt want them to even know i have these doubts
4242979 thats not what i was wanting to say anyhow this book suggests that we have no rights as christians that is no rights to make big money or to get married or lots of other things its only if god chooses for us to have these things that we may have them miss kuhn the writer of the book feels that when we take up our cross daily to follow him like the bible says we are satisfied with what he chooses for our lives that sounds good to me
4242980 does this mean youre not ever going to get married robert
4242981 probably god has someone for me but im only nineteen you know whats the hurry but if not i believe he will make me happy with whatever my life holds quit worrying besides ive got better choices available than sandra you know remember the three girls at buckingham church i told you about and then too when i went to lester chapel last thursday night i saw a girl who seems really nice not that im looking that desperately but my eyes are open
4242982 it could be a bit of a knock on the clean government issue in alaska she backed

4242998 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person in a more positive light i got some great clothes from alexander wang and i miss samantha cuz shes out of town have a wonderful day everyone til next time xx ll

4243002 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4243003 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4243004 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4243005 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4243010 this is about a national aviation process a bigger picture and the only way to solve the problem of delays and congestion is to build the full project
4243011 weve been very sensitive of the fact were displacing people
4243012 weve gone above and beyond to be customer friendly when weve impacted peoples lives
4243013 i think theres a sense of inevitability favoring the city
4243014 it seems more of a question of when the project will be finished rather than if
4243015 unfortunately the congestion problems associated with intensive rearing of animals means that the conditions are ripe for the spread of bacteria among the livestock
4243016 the routine use of low level antibiotics over a prolonged period in animals rather than a short sharp one off treatment is encouraging resistance in livestock
4243017 no one wants to stop farmers using antibiotics when they are genuinely needed however there are a number of very serious problems now developing and the evidence increasingly suggests that food is part of the problem
4243018 this is one of the vanger also known as dust bunnies the vanger are a viscous race of tiny monsters who live in human houses under beds behind desks and the like people often mistake them for a build up of dust but in reality vanger are dangerous but tiny their main source of food are scraps humans drop from their tables and occasionally they eat holes in woollen clothing thought finding holes does not necessarily mean you have vanger in your house

4243025 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honour but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
4243026 if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that

4243072 that was a great example of a solution that leaned more to style than technical substance

4243099 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4243100 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4243101 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4243102 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4243103 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4243104 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4243105 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security
4243106 on this anniversary lets make sure john mccain hears the same message tell john mccain to keep his hands off of our social security

4243133 this is blatant cronyism by gordon brown given the fact that only last week mr stevenson quit the smith institute after a highly critical report by the charities commission it is a sign of even more desperation by the prime minister that he has to bring yet another person into number 10 to try and rescue his flagging fortunes

4243145 deus est cuidando de n s neste pa s do mundo rabe
4243146 comecei ouvindo os programas de r dio por tr s meses ent o decidi me tornar crist e seguir cristo mas como eu poderia fazer isso olhei para um pr dio com uma cruz do outro lado da minha cidade e cuidadosamente comecei a visitar essa igreja sem o v u e sem ser reconhecida pelas pessoas
4243147 depois de um tempo alguns membros da igreja come aram a perceber que eu estava visitando os cultos freq entemente e sa a rapidamente por isso ficaram curiosos algumas mo as me fizeram perguntas e logo perceberam que eu era uma crente ex mu ulmana elas me colocaram em contato com outros ex mu ulmanos homens e mulheres e eu comecei a participar de um grupo secreto
4243148 eles me desafiaram em minha nova f o que foi excelente j que v nhamos todos do mesmo contexto eles me desafiaram a ser batizada o que seria um passo grande e perigoso deram me um tempo para pensar acerca do batismo mas finalmente ap s dois anos pensando e estudando a b blia decidi ser batizada o que aconteceu em um lugar secreto para evitar retalia es descoberta durante esse tempo um dos membros do grupo come ou a ter um interesse especial em mim um interesse mais profundo que o normal e tamb m eu nele ent o come amos a namorar moda rabe dist ncia apenas com olhares mas logo est vamos noivos que coisa maravilhosa dois crentes ex mu ulmanos se apaixonarem mas o que falar amos s nossas fam lias j que elas n o sabiam que ramos crist os
4243149 meu pai e meus irm os j haviam me feito questionamentos sobre meu comportamento mas minha fam lia liberal por isso n o se incomodou at que cheguei com a mensagem de que iria me casar este foi um passo muito grande ent o eles come aram a me amea ar e a me proibir de me casar com um homem que n o conheciam
4243150 isso era estranho especialmente para meu pai e meus irm os e opostamente a toda a cultura eu havia escolhido meu marido por mim mesma e n o por eles mas eu tenho um cora o forte e minha fam lia percebeu que seria muito dif cil me fazer mudar de id ia ao menos meu marido era mu ulmano e por isso eles estavam felizes eles n o haviam percebido que meu futuro marido tamb m tinha trocado sua religi o
4243151 minha fam lia descobriu que meu futuro marido era teoricamente mu ulmano mas na pr tica um crist o tamb m al m disso ele havia perdido o contato com sua fam lia e estava desligado de toda sua fam lia o que inaceit vel no mundo rabe
4243152 portanto minha fam lia n o estava feliz com o marido que eu havia escolhido e come ou a me amea ar novamente houve um dia em que eles vieram com rifles e rev lveres para me matar e tamb m a hani que estava comigo naquele momento felizmente o senhor nos protegeu e meu pai e meus irm os decidiram n o me matar mas a mensagem estava dada
4243153 eu fiquei muito amedrontada e realmente n o me atreveria a me casar com hani em uma conversa com o pastor n s decidimos n o parar mas continuar os nossos planos ent o nos casamos num certo dia por m eu fiquei apavorada durante todo o dia pensando sobre o que poderia acontecer caso minha fam lia mudasse de id ia novamente aleluia nada aconteceu e n s tivemos um grande dia louve ao senhor

4243161 it is not a scrimmage south brunswick coach gordon walters said
4243162 i tell my players every year it is a scrimmage
4243163 in a way it is kind of scary because there are a lot of people there said gilbert who started his first jamboree last year
4243164 i just try to get into my comfort zone ferguson said
4243165 i try to let things settle down and just play the sport that i love the most
4243166 when the kids are messing up in practice we are preaching to them there will be 10 000 people at the jamboree jacksonville coach ben marsh said
4243167 it is a big time atmosphere that is why we are playing in it and love for the kids to play in it because you dont usually get that kind of experience until you get late into the playoffs it is a great high school experience one those kids will remember the rest of their lives
4243168 our kids are always excited about coming to town coach joey price said
4243169 our kids will be prepared even though it will be the last one of the night maybe somebody will stick around and watch us play
4243170 the best thing for us is we feel like we will get a chance to play this year vikings coach scott braswell said
4243171 there is a whole lot of adrenaline there that may not be present in a typical scrimmage braswell said
4243172 how we respond to that will be the big thing
4243173 they may or may not end up in that position during the season he said
4243174 we want to evaluate our players and see where they fit in
4243175 you also hope to see a kid who was average in practice turn it on he said
4243176 it is kind of a dry run for the season
4243177 we didnt do a good job of controlling the ball last year he said
4243178 we felt option was our best opportunity to do so
4243179 i think it is a great way to look at your players it will be a great challenge for our kids
4243180 it is more like working out the kinks he said
4243181 we want to see how the kids handle themselves and see what they are made of he said
4243182 our country cannot truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand america was founded in part with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed
4243183 yo saudi arabia how come there aint no sisters on the team
4243184 our country cannot truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand america was founded in part with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed
4243185 yo saudi arabia how come there aint no sisters on the team
4243186 some kind of shell that we could populate that would also give them things we dont ask for
4243187 when we have the fourth through eighth graders come in here and they have this assignment we can say you can go out there and you can pick different tribes and if it was something we can add tribes too we can work over the long haul we could determine how much to involve tribes
4243188 if we could have some kind of shell where we could populate the information
4243189 something we can populate ourselves we may want to work with tribes to see how they want to be represented

4243210 an enormous tree with its roots buried far below the earth and its branches rising beyond sight toward the sky
4243211 this stone is of delicate touch and there is more mildness in its touch than in its substance of sweet taste and its proper nature is aerial
4243212 tell me of its odor before and after its confection
4243213 i know of no other stone like it nor having its powers
4243214 the thing in which the entire accomplishment of this operation consists of the red vapor the yellow vapor the white vapor the green lion ocher the impurities of the dead and of the stones blood eudica and foul earth
4243215 begin in the creators name and with his vapor take the whiteness from the white vapor
4243216 the whole key to accomplishment of this operation is in the fire with which the minerals are prepared and the bad spirits held back and with which the spirit and body are joined
4243217 in answer to you question about the white vapor or virgins milk you may know that it is a tincture and spirit of those bodies already dissolved and dead from which the spirits have been withdrawn
4243218 without the white vapor there could have been no pure gold nor any profit in it
4243219 were all here to worship god so why talk about names which may tend to divide us
4243220 that was a good lesson you gave for the children tonight
4243221 i tried to bring what i felt god would help them to remember and use beulah says that some of these children seldom come to services so i wanted to give them something useful
4243222 so that makes bill my uncle yep uncle bill and aunt beulah im their nephew
4243223 usually i dont come during the week being in college and all
4243224 but ill have to see about thursday night if im caught up on homework i may ride along to church with the pastor no promises though

4243226 do you make music i bring my clarinet every service how about you any instruments or a good singing voice
4243227 and you do a good job on the clarinet too
4243228 i took lessons on piano and was in the school band for a year playing trombone i dont have a trombone now though so i cant bring it
4243229 penny i hate to spoil your fun but i really have to be heading back home maybe you two should get together sometime outside of church no one to rush you just a thought

4243234 mom ill be going to adrian saturday for a few hours just thought youd like to know
4243235 i should be back long before time to do the milking
4243236 i found it recently and am really concerned about some of the thoughts in it
4243237 no i usually read about missionary experiences rather than introspective books i like the action books one of the men ive read about a lot is hudson taylor
4243238 oh hudson taylors spiritual secret that was quite a book did you like it
4243239 no i havent read it tell me more about it so i can decide if i want to read it
4243240 its about his experiences in china of course i like how he tried to allow god to meet all his needs if he needed something he prayed and did nothing to make the thing happen himself
4243241 like once he needed money to pay his rent and his employer had forgotten to pay him which seemed to be a regular pattern instead of telling his boss he needed the money he asked god to remind him just in the knick of time he did too
4243242 i prefer to just tell people if they owe me something not take every little thing to god in prayer
4243243 dont take me wrong in what im about to say
4243244 i feel worship is more important than service i think we need to be in an attitude of worship all the time even if we are not doing some kind of christian service i think hudson taylor felt that way too

4243251 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
4243252 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
4243253 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
4243254 cycle 23 which hasnt finished yet looks like it will be long at least 12 to 13 years and cycle 24 which has still to start looks like it will be exceptionally weak
4243255 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades
4243256 temperatures have already fallen by about 0 5 degrees c over the past 12 months and if this is only the start of it it would be a serious concern
4243257 the greatest thickening during the period of measurement occurred between 1931 and 1945 when the glacier thickened by about 50 near 2 800 meters of altitude this and subsequent thickenings during the mid 1970s to mid 1980s produced waves that advanced its terminus glacier thinning occured during intervening periods between 1994 and 1997 the glacier thickened by 17 meters at 2 800 m altitude indicating probable glacier advance during the first decade of the 21st century

4243288 reaching out to the people that decide what is newsworthy and whether they want to cover it is a crucial component of effective publicity
4243289 all media outlets are literally inundated with thousands of press releases a week without a telephone call and e mail or fax and a professional pitch most press releases are passed over and the publicity effort fails
4243290 to make our services affordable to any business and even small budgets we use a pay as you go model allowing our customers to access media pitchers according to their specific needs
4243291 our staff of journalists and public relations experts review each release find the most pertinent elements of the story and then present it to editors and reporters in a credible and newsworthy fashion its the most logical and effective method to achieve editorial coverage
4243292 sending a press release out through a distribution service is really just the beginning of the public relations process
4243293 when an editor or reporter receives a telephone call and e mail immediately after a news release hits the internet the chances of it capturing their attention and gaining real editorial coverage increases dramatically few organizations today have the time or resources to perform the media pitching function in house which is where our service comes into play

4243303 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4243304 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4243305 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4243306 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4243307 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4243308 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4243309 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4243310 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4243311 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4243312 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4243317 adequate supplies are reaching new internally displaced persons idps in sri lankas northern areas controlled by the tamil tigers un and humanitarian relief officials in the capital colombo at least 12 000 families have fled the fighting in the last two months in the northern parts of mannar district southwestern areas of kilinochchi district and mulaitivu district according to un officials and most are now in the outskirts of kilinochchi town under the control of the tigers 300km north of the capital
4243318 many people have received basic humanitarian relief but as the number of displaced persons increases so do their needs
4243319 none of the idps are cut off they are all accessible
4243320 due to ongoing clashes more displacement is anticipated and then more supplies will be needed
4243321 the situation will get worse when the rainy season starts by the end of september
4243322 it is unfortunate that many people business executives as well as so called security experts believe that the implementation of one or two security products can address security issues there cannot be a one size fits all approach to security as each environment is different with its own set of vulnerabilities and some security products themselves contain flaws which increase a networks vulnerability rather than reduce it
4243323 indeed if businesses are serious about security they need to understand that the only way to truly check that they are secure is to view the code thats one of the reasons i believe open source software is the better option for companies where security is of the utmost concern its not that open source is more secure but rather the fact that you can view the code see any vulnerabilities yourself and even fix if necessary if you have the skills to do so
4243324 we could accomplish pretty much everything that needed to be done by simply addressing the issue of cohabitation rather than brining in heterosexual or homosexual either one
4243325 this is too much government in family matters they cant throw out a group of potentially good parents because it doesnt help and can even harm children

4243359 then ill probably force you to drive every time i want to go anywhere
4243360 you know im probably losing more than anyone else see i had to move into that middle bedroom upstairs so that grandma can have my old room mom that room has no windows and besides kerry and robert have to go through my room to get to theirs so i have no privacy at all its no fun being the so called baby of the family you know that
4243361 if robert or kerry move out or get married or whatever you can take the room they leave behind i wish i could promise you more than that
4243362 why cant somebody else take grandma why is it us
4243363 i havent seen her for over a year i think and she didnt even know me then this wont be fun
4243364 it will be hard for all of us ben with me working nights and your dad on nights too you boys will have your hands full sometimes i cant afford to hire someone to come in and cook for her and watch over her its not fair of me to ask you young men to do this i just dont have any answers
4243365 robert is good at cooking and usually at least one of us is at home most of the time well make it something will work out i hope at least
4243366 ben she means grandpa not robert your brother shes confused and doesnt always realize that grandpas dead
4243367 chauncey while the boys are busy let me tell you what ruth and paul said
4243368 ruth said she and paul talked about it and called all the other kids they decided to make me the legal guardian of mom i have a letter from them to take to the courthouse and to the social security it declares me to be her guardian space and gives me permission to sign her name on checks and to do her business
4243369 they realize that mom is going to be a great burden on us they want me to have the social security checks for our needs as we take care of her
4243370 so what will you do with it buy her clothes and medicine or what
4243371 for one thing i can now hire someone part time to take care of her while i work at night maybe three or four hours a night to keep her company and giver her her baths and see she gets her medicine at night
4243372 just as i figured they would makes me proud to in the family
4243373 im the least member getting booted out of my room and into the dungeon with no windows
4243374 oh ive thought about that its got to be hard for you
4243375 i know i wouldnt like a room with no windows and its not really private either is it
4243376 im spending all next weekend with your aunt and uncle i have friday off at school so i will stay from thursday after prayer meeting until sunday night then ill go back to adrian with the pastor thought youd like to know
4243377 pennys going to be my girl for a few days maybe you should come over too

4243379 mom would it be ok to have someone for dinner sunday
4243380 i want to meet her i can put on another plate between you and ben
4243381 you mean between robert and kerry it its a girl she gets to sit beside the real man of the family thats me
4243382 so its settled you invite her robert and ill put her plate between you and kerry
4243383 i want to explain something before we get to my home
4243384 my grandma just moved in with us a few weeks ago
4243385 i like older people they have so much to share which i can learn from
4243386 the reason she is with us is that she cant be alone at all any more she has some type of artery problem in her head shes not sensible at all any more she doesnt even know my name or even my moms name she usually forgets that grandpa died eight years ago
4243387 i have worked in hospitals and nursing homes ive seen this type of behavior before so i wont be shocked or offended by your grandmother im sure she is sweet even if not really alert any more dont be worried about how it will affect me
4243388 im considering getting training as a registered nurse after i get my teaching degree
4243389 shes amazing a teacher and a nurse both in the same person i dont deserve someone so talented
4243390 oh that last one is a church song isnt it i like that one a lot
4243391 no we heard it a lot at some of the wedding receptions weve gone to the last few years for members of the lewis family its always the last song of the night and the bride and groom dance in the center of the floor while other serious couples dance around them the words are something like now is the hour when we must say good bye
4243392 mom i think it is used in churches too but with different words thats where penny heard the melody
4243393 right the words of the church song if i can remember are search me oh lord and know my heart today try me oh savior know my thoughts i pray i really dont remember all the words but it has been encouraging for me to pray that way at times
4243394 it looks like she thinks she is in church maybe she knew that song too
4243395 she was a good christian and raised all of us in church some of us have left the training she and grandpa gave us but we cant forget how we lived when we were young
4243396 i know she no longer has her right mind but im sure she is headed for gods heaven i just know it
4243397 do you have any favorite foods i can fix for tomorrow i mean robert said he had invited you for lunch so i want it to be special for you
4243398 anything i enjoy eating im sure your country style cooking will suit me fine
4243399 ill pray for all of you too you seem to be such a happy family ill ask god to give you the one thing which could make you even happier and that is his presence in your lives

4243451 n o podemos ir pensando em empatar tem que ir em busca da vit ria o empate pode ser bom dependendo do momento da partida vai ser um bom resultado
4243452 todo mundo est ciente do que significa esta partida para a seq ncia do brasileiro n o s essa partida mas as outras tamb m ser o importantes para a nossa equipe
4243453 com certeza eu iria ele tem que ir ficam falando em jogar na europa mas o jogador tem que pensar na fam lia dele no futuro se for bom para ele para o clube e para a fam lia tem que ir mesmo
4243454 tenho conversado bastante com o vald via ele um craque tem provado isso e propostas v o vir toda hora essa n o a primeira
4243455 isso um assunto muito subjetivo e que s o vald via pode responder a proposta em termos financeiros muito boa para ele cada um pensa de um jeito ele pode at ficar meio fora do mercado mas os emirados rabes t m investido muito no futebol e ele pode continuar na sele o chilena isso pode compensar um pouco
4243456 n o tem frustra o nosso foco conquistar o t tulo e temos esse compromisso com a nossa torcida o vald via pode sair mas nosso primeiro objetivo n o vender ningu m conquistar t tulos
4243457 pelo que a gente sabe ele ainda jogador do palmeiras mas ele n o conversou com a gente sobre isso n o deve estar decidido espero que ele volte depois de jogar na sele o chilena para treinar com a gente
4243458 eu conversei com o professor ricardo ontem e ele falou a mesma coisa contou a hist ria do xuxa quando ele tava na raia oito em 96
4243459 e a hoje a hora que eu bati na chegada eu pensei nisso

4243599 not mom she cleans in a nursing home there at bay city she hopes to get social security in a few years and then retire
4243600 my dad used to be a pastor after he and mom broke up the home i lost contact with him especially when he remarried about five years later we didnt have much material goods when i was a child and i feel my dad could have done better
4243601 hes sick i think my youngest sister janet keeps in touch with him and has told me that he has leukemia
4243602 penny i think you would have liked the sunday school lesson i heard this morning at my church i wish you could have been there
4243603 i dont know how to say this but i really do not want to attend that church they have some ideas that i really dont accept im sure some of the people are good people but i feel they have some problems in their practices
4243604 i have seen nothing wrong with the quakers they seem just like the people at lester chapel and at buckingham church in fact the lady who pastors at buckingham is a quaker too what have i overlooked in the friends people
4243605 lets discuss it another time for now just borrow one of the disciplines of lester chapel church and compare it with that of the st leon friends i think youll see some big differences
4243606 no i and grandma will do them a little later and call me lila ok
4243607 that was ramona on the phone ramona santana shes one of my college friends she said that my dad called the emergency number at school and says i should call him soon she gave me the number
4243608 we wont bother you i want you to use it
4243609 he knows i dont want to talk to him he should not be calling me he needs to let me call him if i ever decide i want to
4243610 ramona says that he claims it has something to do with my younger sister julie i doubt theres anything to it see julie is really close to my dad but she doesnt live any better than he does shes divorced has a son and lives a pretty wicked life i think it is some kind of trick to make me talk to dad
4243611 dont get scared but you blacked out for a few seconds
4243612 we really did shout because you suddenly passed out and we tried to wake you up
4243613 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4243614 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4243615 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah
4243616 there is a woman here who is how old are you actually what does it matter anyway you look a lot younger and she lost consciousness at the seashore after a meal in a restaurant and she says she did not eat anything that was not good
4243617 and you will admit that relative to the 10th year of pregnancy i am pretty thin
4243618 no i am just a retired doctor who happened to be in the restaurant and saw the woman pass out on the sand and came to help and dont worry
4243619 its a pity you didnt propose maybe you didnt get around to it you can propose now after all she has already fainted
4243620 are you going to suggest that i sniff smelling salts

4243624 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back
4243625 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
4243626 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
4243627 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick

4243633 this has been an exciting quarter for trm as we completed our acquisition of access to money and secured 11 million in financing from lampe conway our acquisition of access to money has assured that trm will remain one of the largest independent atm networks in the united states and the financing has put us on solid financial footing i am also pleased that our operational results are showing continued improvements our q2 2008 adjusted ebitda from continuing operations improved by 60 over q1 to 836 000 this improvement would have been even more dramatic but for certain one time non recurring adjustments that were recorded in april moreover while we reported a net loss of 3 7 million 2 9 million of that was tied to non cash stock compensation and loss from early debt redemption and another 380 000 due to the one time non recurring items impacting ebitda as noted above furthermore results for the quarter do not yet reflect many of the cost saving synergies that we anticipate from the access to money acquisition we expect that those benefits will be partially realized in q3 and fully implemented by q4 we believe these financial and operational developments set the stage for an improved trm as we focus on providing the best possible products and services to our customers
4243634 we continue to make substantial progress towards improving our financial condition i am extremely encouraged by the results we announced today and expect that we will show further improvement as we continue along with our integration plan

4243638 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4243639 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4243640 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4243641 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4243642 a may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4243643 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4243644 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4243645 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues
4243646 too many of our kids dont believe they can go to college

4243712 we had inside sources from bigger companies who gave us the information on how exclusivity deals are being made at this moment between isps and big content pro viders to decide which web sites will be in the standard package offered to their customers leaving the rest of the net unreachable unless you pay extra subscript ion fees per every non standard site you visit
4243713 we knew the source to be 100 reliable but we also knew the story would be highly controversial if we released the information we did it because we knew that wed get more official confirmations once wed come forward with it and indeed that is what happened dylan pattyn who is writing the soon to be published article for time magazine received confirmation from sources within bell canada and telus after we released the information
4243714 the internet will become a playground for billion dollar content providers just like television is
4243715 it wont be possible for a few teenagers in their parents basement to start a small site like e bay that then grows out to be the next big thing anymore right now the internet belongs to those with the greatest ideas in the future itll belong to those with the biggest budgets
4243716 by 2012 isps all over the globe will reduce internet access to a tv like subscription model only offering access to a small standard amount of commercial sites and require extra fees for every other site you visit these other sites would then lose all their exposure and eventually shut down resulting in what could be seen as the end of the internet

4243752 capacity utilization is now at a four month low reflecting refiners reluctance to process crude oil
4243753 every major crude oil refiner reported losses in its refining business in the second quarter as a result of this financial stress refiners are curtailing their processing efforts
4243754 nonetheless a sustained increase in gasoline demand will boost the gasoline crack spread and coax refiners to boost production

4243757 we are always going to be a side thats going to be a little bit patchy because kids give you those inconsistencies

4243762 you cant manufacture anything more than that finals are one of the greatest carrots in front of anyone and obviously collingwood have got it this week and for our guys its going to be motivationally very difficult
4243763 we did the right thing and the best thing for our club moving forward and thats as bad as it might seem the no 1 thing we have to consider the good and the life and the continuity of the club and you make decisions for long term rather than short term
4243764 i dont think the way to beat them is to rough them up youve just got to be physical and match them as much as you can up front

4243768 i suppose it is a bit of a sign of how the games going to be but i think everyones pretty sure how theyre going to turn up
4243769 teams come in trying to play that aggressive in your face type of football and we kind of enjoy it too fighting fire with fire standing up to be counted
4243770 you have to match up depending on what tactic teams bring you adapt to it

4243803 well i didnt expect this kind of request ben we really are crowded right now besides im awfully busy with working and taking care of grandmas needs and all the work i have just for our immediate family i dont know about taking in one more person
4243804 i dont have any rights here anyway maybe ill just find somewhere else to live i cant have my friends here or anything
4243805 ben dont go out i want to discuss this i didnt say that we cant help just give me a chance to work on it
4243806 you can have your friends over sometimes you do have company thats all right but taking someone in is something else
4243807 mom bring it up some other time when im not angry
4243808 for now im going to the store front to practice
4243809 mom whats wrong i saw ben outside and he looked upset now i can see that youre worked up too
4243810 hes been changing a lot lately for a few weeks robert said something to me about it too he needs some kind of help
4243811 we can work on it then for now we must plan on a good day tomorrow we have penny coming for thanksgiving and it will be a good day im sure your dad and i will deal with ben later
4243812 welcome back ive been waiting for your help if you feel like having a part in preparing the meal
4243813 i wont cut the noodles one at a time this time
4243814 but i havent yet whipped the cream to put on the dessert care to do that
4243815 yes just show me what to do thats something ive never done
4243816 what did i do wrong the whipped cream was getting really pretty but now its getting lumps in it did i do something wrong
4243817 youve whipped it too long it was ready earlier but when you kept whipping it it became butter
4243818 im sorry like i said ive never done this before now ive ruined the whipped cream its not funny but it really is funny too now theres no whipped cream for the pie
4243819 i squeeze a lot of cream from the cow every day im sure we can skim enough off the milk in the fridge to try again right mom
4243820 of course ill skim off some more cream and let you start over again dont be upset penny this happens a lot to new cooks
4243821 mom i heard her early this morning and that was all she said i wonder why
4243822 she probably doesnt even know what shes saying its ok just let her say it
4243823 im leaving everything on the table everyone can just come in and pick up whatever they want for the rest of the day but for now lets go into the living room and be more comfortable
4243824 im a little sore from the puncture but its not really too painful im glad i could help my sister
4243825 no not really ben she would not talk to me before the procedure saying she was too sleepy from the anesthetic and too sick from the chemotherapy so i accepted it for the time but after it was over i waited around until the next day hoping to get to talk to her she wouldnt talk
4243826 i went to julies room on tuesday two days ago just before janet drove me back to adrian i told her i was praying for her and that i was glad i got to be the one to donate marrow for her
4243827 god is helping me he knows and i know and i think my sister knows that i love her deeply my gift to her was not conditional i did not ask her to repay me by being pleasant to me i think she will think about it for a long time and she will some day be grateful and thankful
4243828 she needed what you were able to give her that should mean something to her
4243829 robert why dont you play the piano for a few songs this is a holiday so we need music
4243830 mom im going to the store front i think marty and some of the others are going to be there this afternoon to practice ok
4243831 bring them in for some leftovers after a while if you want theres plenty
4243832 go on play it i like it especially the chorus it says and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me i am his own and the joys we share as we tarry there none other has ever known
4243833 this reminds me of a friend of mine many years ago when i was a teenager
4243834 her name was ethel and she was going with a boy named andrew whenever they sang that song in church some of us would look at ethel and laugh and she knew what we were thinking
4243835 the chorus we changed the spelling of a couple of words and sent ethel a note instead of and he walks with me and he talks with me we changed the words to andy walks with me andy talks with me it was so funny we shortened the name andrew to andy ethel and andy finally got married and weve always laughed with them about how the chorus sounds
4243836 i can see that you liked to have fun when you were young so do i none of that ultra serious stuff for me i think god wants us to laugh and enjoy life
4243837 its kind of cool but it was nice to get away from the noises of the city and to hear a few birds and see a few wild creatures we even saw a pair of deer a long way back from the road
4243838 sure well make a farm girl out of you yet
4243839 yes i could tell that something was wrong after your afternoon walk with penny son what is it
4243840 her friend at college that ramona who called here that one sunday afternoon shes talked penny into going into what she calls home missionary work in texas of all places
4243841 texas thats hard to believe i mean shes only got a year of college left doesnt she why not finish first before going into something so far away
4243842 her friend at college ramona santana is from near el paso texas she told penny that she could do home missionary work among the mexican people there and at the same time get some training as a nurse at a hospital there
4243843 it was her im going to bill and beulahs and were going to town for a while
4243844 ill be around yet for christmas and even new years
4243845 so that means i want some ideas for christmas gifts i can get for your family know what i mean
4243846 it means you are determined to go to texas i cant change your mind in any way can i
4243847 besides i prayed and feel its an open door for service and i should go
4243848 wont that door always be open i mean its in the united states not overseas where you need visas and such you can always go to texas even in a year after you finish your degree
4243849 ramonas older sister is in the admissions department of the nursing school at columbia medical center she can assure my acceptance for the spring term and can help me find some financial assistance i can get an lpn degree in two years or an rn in about three and a half years that door may not remain open such as if she is no longer working there to help me get in
4243850 this is a special one with three locations in el paso and is in the foothills of the franklin mountains ramona has told me all about it
4243851 i just know it everything is falling into place and my heart wants to go i can be a missionary to the mexican people there and still be getting my nursing degree
4243852 but you have just one more year and youll be finished with your teaching degree here why not finish it first
4243853 gods ways are not as our ways thats in the scriptures his ways do not always sound sensible to humans but years later we sometimes see what he had in his plan that we could not see earlier this is definitely is gods will
4243854 um can we talk i mean i want to say something to you i kind of dont know how to start
4243855 what is it big boy you arent afraid to talk to me are you let me help you get started is it good or bad
4243856 and i think really i know that we enjoy being together right
4243857 id like to offer you a better alternative to moving to texas
4243858 give me a minute to just wait a little ill say it yet
4243859 penny i would like for you to consider marrying me later we could think about going somewhere in christian work or whatever god wants of us what do you say
4243860 ive not been having such serious thoughts about our future robert i enjoy being with you yes but im really not ready for such a commitment
4243861 im not saying never just not right now im sorry if im hurting you
4243862 i was too blunt i think dont let this ruin christmas for us ok i picked a bad time to bring this up its just that i really dont want you to go to texas in a couple of weeks really ill miss you terribly
4243863 maybe god will work something out i dont know but for now i must make the move well keep in touch after all youre one of my closest friends
4243864 ive hoped for that for some time it means a lot to me robert and i really had a great time with your family tonight i almost feel that im part of their lives youre all such a beautiful family no big problems lots of good feelings toward each other i envy you good night
4243865 its three more days before i go into missionary work not today
4243866 i dont think she understands what im saying so i was just having fun with her
4243867 its ok grandma likes the interaction with you even if she doesnt really understand it its good for her to have you talk to her
4243868 luella youre here oh john my boy john im so happy to see you here
4243869 chauncey robert i think shes seeing into heaven she mentioned john my brother who died in world war two and luella her sister i think she sees into heaven
4243870 i saw heaven and my friends who are there oh lila its so beautiful there
4243871 i knew jesus looked like that im ready i want to stay
4243872 robert robert i knew you would be here to help me in
4243873 and its what im living for too even though im not old yet
4243874 the indian air force has selected hawk as the ideal platform for training its next generation of frontline pilots the handover of the first hawk trainer assembled in india by hal is a significant milestone for the indian air force and everyone associated with the programme
4243875 why not life is short life is dull life is full of pain why not do something special
4243876 my spot on the bed is my spot in the world
4243877 pleasurable and i might go cast the people and see my characters come to life
4243878 and i put the music in and i see the characters playing their scenes to the beautiful music behind them you know i get a kick out of that and if nobody else does thats too bad
4243879 when youre a kid you think to yourself fame and fortune and its going to be so exciting and but then you quickly find after three or four films you find wait a minute the upside is nothing and the downside is nothing the adulation of the multitudes or of the critics is an impersonal experience and the negative feelings from people is an impersonal experience the contract that the audience has with the person is you entertain us and well show up and that is as the contract should be
4243880 i always wanted to make the kinds of films that i saw in the 1950s
4243881 barcelona is a city that i can live in very easily
4243882 if they mentioned some city in the ukraine or the sudan or something i would have said no but barcelona is a beautiful wonderful city

4243886 i think part of our success is that we work hard at it and we love the business
4243887 you have to love it to make it successful but we do there is a comfort to a place like ours its a living piece of american nostalgia
4243888 my mother came here as a child and then she brought me as a child and now im bringing my children
4243889 you are not elbow to elbow with people you are not waiting in line for hours to get on a ride there are no fast passes or other gimmicks that can drive you crazy because you are trying to get onto everything in one day and its affordable
4243890 there is no pressure its interesting and convenient for the kids and i think they sense that im not so stressed so they have more fun
4243891 and if i wasnt in on time my parents would lock the doors and id have to crawl across the roofs of the buildings in order to climb in my bedroom window
4243892 we had the beach and swimming there but that was not as popular as it once was
4243893 i like the fact that this is like the places i went to when i was a kid
4243894 i think we are all looking for some comfort these days what with the economy and the political unrest and lives with too many obligations and not enough time to enjoy anything anymore what we need is more of this and less disney craziness
4243895 we gave up a two week beach vacation this year because of the cost
4243896 but we wanted to have some summer fun and this was a way to swim see a show go on the rides and not blow the budget im happy with it and so are the kids
4243897 treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4243898 me decid por liga porque es un equipo grande liga es como boca o river
4243899 i didnt feel like there was a definite advantage going into tonight
4243900 when im playing well i can hopefully play with the best in the world and i do believe i proved that tonight it couldnt happen on a better stage for me hopefully the people back home appreciate the work ive done to get here
4243901 i have those memories of watching him when i didnt know if id be able to play again
4243902 playing in the olympics seemed a long long way away it makes me appreciate here makes me appreciate everything ive gotten and i know how lucky i am
4243903 i thought if i could play the big points well there was no reason why i cant win
4243904 today i played the big points well especially on my serve i made a lot of first serves on big points especially in the tie breaker
4243905 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children

4243912 i am vazut inainte de a ajunge in cabina telefonica mergeau pe strada si vorbeau normal cand deodata au intrat amandoi in cabina cu geamul transparent dupa ce s au sarutat si s au mangaiat femeia a ingenunchiat si i a facut sex oral barbatului apoi au facut sex in toate pozitiile aproape 45 de minute nici nu s au sinchisit ca erau priviti
4243913 la un moment dat femeia chiar si a aprins o tigara pe care a fumat o ca si cum nimic nu se intampla in timp ce barbatul incerca sa o satisfaca a fost un spectacol jenant si jignitor la adresa trecatorilor
4243914 stories zu einzelnen unternehmen sind aber rar die berichtssaison ist so gut wie vor ber und wer etwas zu sagen hatte hat es gesagt

4243924 that sounds fair to me after all it was his room until grandma moved in
4243925 hes been talking about us letting marty jackson move in it seems that his dad is moving away and marty wants to graduate from this high school
4243926 he asked ben if we could take him in for the rest of the school year just until graduation so he can finish here
4243927 this marty guy doesnt have a good reputation he spends a lot of time at the store front where ben goes a lot
4243928 its not my business i guess but i think hes a bad influence on ben
4243929 hes getting harder to live with sometimes i just cant reason with him at all
4243930 like i said i think its those people at the store front including marty
4243931 regardless of how tough your dad seems to be hes really soft hearted maybe ben will convince him i really cant outguess him
4243932 bens almost never home he and marty leave saying theyre going to the store front and they sometimes dont get back here till after eleven oclock i drove past the store front a few times and it was locked up and dark i dont think this is for good who knows what theyre up to out so late and lying to me about where they are
4243933 ill talk to your dad about it when he gets home
4243934 mom have there been any phone calls for me in the daytime when im at work
4243935 i just thought maybe penny would call shes been there nearly a month now and i dont have a number to call her its ok i was just wondering mom
4243936 why arent we seeing you at church any more is it because your girl is no longer there
4243937 i was attending there before she was so you know i originally was there for the spiritual help i was getting but she provided a reason for me to attend there more often that is after we met
4243938 penny said that you seemed a little shallow not well grounded she called it guess she may have been right think so
4243939 what did she mean by that did she really say such a thing
4243940 maybe i shouldnt have told you but yep she said that a couple of times while she spent those days at my house
4243941 do you know what she meant i mean about me being shallow and not grounded i never expected to hear such a thing from her
4243942 you still attend the friends church dont you thats part of it
4243943 yes i was saved in that church and ive done a lot of growing because of that church
4243944 i dont know a thing about the church thats not good i do remember though that penny said something just one time about something being wrong with the quakers i dont know what it could be though i find them closer than some of my own family at least in some ways
4243945 god will show you the truth if youll seek it just study and pray and of course well be pleased as everything to have you become part of lester chapel that is after you see your error and correct it
4243946 still i think you need to learn the way more perfectly thats all
4243947 sure ill pray for gods guidance im not too proud to change still i dont know what needs to be changed in my life
4243948 hey big brother how about me taking your car to adrian this afternoon theres a big mall there and i wanted to take in some shopping any chance
4243949 maybe i could drive you there and even let you drive on the way but i cant give up my car for the whole afternoon
4243950 if you need to go somewhere just ask me to take you there
4243951 you do not get to take it without me being with you never again
4243952 theyve been back at my cars again im going to put a stop to it wheres ben and marty
4243953 theyve got blankets down there in that old station wagon and yes more beer bottles some not opened yet but its worse than that i found some womens underwear and this
4243954 that stuff is not mine but i think i know whose purse that is it looks like sandras but i havent been back there with her ive not been anywhere with her for many months not since i met penny at church
4243955 if robert hasnt been back there what does this mean
4243956 looks like ben or martin have been seeing roberts old girl friend
4243957 i want to see them when they get back here
4243958 no come in here now you can go upstairs later
4243959 and if martin is with you he should come in here too
4243960 hes tired so he wants to go straight to bed
4243961 no i expect to see both of you in here now
4243962 we have important things to discuss all three of us get in here now
4243963 were going to have the truth so dont plan to try to fool me
4243964 im in charge here ill ask and you two are to provide answers ok
4243965 what do you mean dad it looks like girls unmentionables
4243966 where in the world did you get that stuff mr lewis
4243967 i found them in my old ford station wagon i pulled to the back of the farm a while back and thats not all either i found beer bottles some empty and some not yet opened i found blankets out there too looks as though someones been engaging in some hanky panky with a girl
4243968 are you grilling us because you found that stuff out back if so you got the wrong person just ask ben here weve seen somebody going back there but youd never believe who it was right ben
4243969 yeah dad if we told you youd have trouble believing whos been spending time back there
4243970 i want to know whos been back there in my car mind you i know it wasnt just one person ben who were they
4243971 we really dont want to tell you mr lewis youd be very upset
4243972 if you insist ill tell you but id prefer to say nothing maybe it would be best if we just kind of reported to you if they go back there again well be your watchdogs
4243973 there were three or more of you out there boys
4243974 we saw one of your sons and his former girl friend out there more than once
4243975 youve given me part of the truth mr jackson but you twisted it didnt you
4243976 sir i resent the implication its the truth your oldest son has been taking his old girl friend back there weve seen robert and sandra sneaking to the back of the farm havent we ben at least two times
4243977 we didnt want to tell you dad you and mom seem to think roberts an angel or something but what marty told you is the truth hes got a phony id and has been buying beer and drinking it with sandra while you and mom are at work at night thats the honest truth dad
4243978 thats just not believable boys robert is living a good life and i cant find any way to believe hes drinking and living an immoral life with sandra he quit seeing her over six months ago
4243979 ill ask robert about your claim but im sure ill be talking to you two again about all this
4243980 you dont trust me at all and neither does mom
4243981 robert gets treated the best of any of us all the time and im tired of it
4243982 yep i am but youre running sort of late for work arent you
4243983 i called in to take the day off im going to adrian on business i mean i didnt quit or anything dad
4243984 see you later maybe ill be home before you and mom leave for work
4243985 son somebody told me that you and sandra are seeing each other again now that penny has left is it true
4243986 you havent been back on the back of the farm with her at night
4243987 what is this all about im not interested in someone of her type i thought you knew that now dad tell me whos spreading these stories about me
4243988 dad its not true not at all i have nothing to do with sandra sure i miss penny a lot but i will never return to someone like sandra ill have a christian girl or no girl at all believe me
4243989 i really have a lot of confidence in you to be honest the only reason i questioned you is because i told ben and martin that i would ask you thats all i would have been disappointed if you were guilty of what they said
4243990 now go on to do your business at adrian robert
4243991 ill not bring this subject up to you again oh im not a praying man as you know but i might be grateful if you would pray for for how i should deal with ben and martin i know its only a couple of weeks until graduation and martin will be gone from here but i guess i have to do something about him staying here even that long
4243992 ive been praying about it a lot anyhow see you later
4243993 it almost seems that emotions must be a gift from satan that god does not want people to have emotions thats how my family acts
4243994 well mr lewis can i get you some coffee or something
4243995 i just need to talk to someone about maybe joining the navy
4243996 do you happen to have your selective service card with you i can look up your file and begin talking
4243997 am i a co im not sure what a co is
4243998 i cant take a co into most areas of the navy if you ask to change your status i can consider you for more things i could possibly take you into some type of non combat service like perhaps a medic or a chaplain do you have church credentials or medical training robert
4243999 you are one and you dont know it i take it you are either a jehovahs witness or a quaker am i right
4244000 yes im a member of st leon friends meeting thats a quaker
4244001 then why are you trying to join the navy most of the quakers are conscientious objectors
4244002 do you really feel this way or is it just some teaching of your church not many religious people can get by with asking for co status but quakers get it
4244003 i prayed about it a lot when i had to fill out the selective service forms on my eighteenth birthday i know for sure that i could not ever use a weapon and kill anyone
4244004 how about for self defense or to defend your family
4244005 ive never had to defend myself to that extent or my family either so i cant say for sure but i really doubt i could do it
4244006 id try to trust the lord to take care of me if not im ready to go to heaven at any time i really think im a co
4244007 it doesnt look like i can use you robert unless theres a war we cant take a co except for religious duties and sometimes for some medic duties
4244008 if you change your mind come and see me have a good day mr lewis
4244009 many people are foolishly bound to evil habits and evil associations
4244010 perhaps most of us seem foolishly bound to something in our lives as for me id rather be considered a fool for god than a fool for any other cause
4244011 just keep it ill sleep in the dungeon that you forced me into when grandma moved in at least until i move away
4244012 the better room is yours if you want it if you dont want it maybe one of your brothers will take it and you can have their room but its settled and you cant change my decision martin is not to return to this house for any reason ever
4244013 im not sure ill ever come back why was i born its sure that you didnt want me why was i even born
4244014 i hate you get out of my way and out of my life
4244015 just leave me alone all of you im getting out of this family just as soon as i can
4244016 what do you think i am the prodigal son or something
4244017 i havent left my fathers house yet im not the prodigal until i go away so leave me alone until then ok
4244018 you have two fathers who care a lot about you ben our dad cares about you thats why he sent marty away to protect you from a bad influence but you have a father in heaven who cares much more than dad does
4244019 i dont think dad cares nor mom nor you you hear me and as for god hes for weaklings who go to a church that believes you shouldnt fight youll all find out soon enough that i dont go for that stuff im part irish and part indian and ill fight and ill win without a god to do it for me now leave me alone
4244020 he has ways of dealing with people which we could never think of just trust him robert
4244021 he didnt come home from his halloween trick or treating weve looked all over for him and cant find him
4244022 he took a big bag full of something when he left
4244023 i and kerry just got done looking in his room and most of his clothes are gone
4244024 ive been expecting to hear something like this weve not been able to reach him to convince him that we care for him

4244043 competitiveness for developers will be defined by shareholder returns as higher returns attract capital and other resources and opportunities however managing to shareholder returns requires a shift from a project based to a portfolio based perspective

4244045 we are very pleased that elk valley coal has taken the lead on this much needed project and look forward to its completion
4244046 the look and feel of the architectural design will set the context for further developments in our community and is exactly what we have been looking for
4244047 the fact that we already owned the property which is zoned for high density residential meant that we could move ahead much faster than normally expected with a project of this size
4244048 we are happy to be able to do something to address the housing challenges in the elk valley and see this as a win win opportunity that will benefit the entire community

4244074 these earnings results are in line with managements plan for the current fiscal year
4244075 i am particularly pleased that the portfolios returns have remained resilient during this recent period of economic uncertainty as our public equity markets have struggled to adjust to increased global energy and commodity costs slower u s growth realigned exchange rates and signs of a moderating domestic economy
4244076 our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year remains cautiously positive while we are seeing some effects from the u s slowdown in some of our smaller operating partnerships such as armstrong and ic group for the most part the investments in the portfolio are performing in accordance with the business plans that we reviewed and approved with management for fiscal 2008
4244077 with respect to plans for dealing with the pending changes to the funds tax structure management is reviewing the rules governing the conversion of trusts to taxable corporations that were recently released by the federal government our analysis of these rules will provide management with a better sense of how different conversion options may apply to the fund and the impact each of these options could be expected to have on our unitholders

4244087 i think it will take place at speeds of around 56 km h with peaks reaching 70 km h
4244088 with 36 cyclists on the track it can get rowdy there is a lot of contact but few crashes
4244089 what i like about 200 kilometre road races are the last five minutes

4244091 the owner of the horse has not complied with the order to have the horse destroyed so an inspector is being instructed to carry out the destruction order

4244093 i am not going to let this lie the person that has made the decision will be made accountable
4244094 i am not going to leave any stone unturned to make sure that their decision is wrong
4244095 the government has never offered to settle the cobell vs kempthorne lawsuit at any price
4244096 every proposal made by plaintiffs and by mediators to settle the case has been rejected by the government
4244097 oh yes and it also included provisions to deny indians any right to bring any future lawsuits for future mismanagement no matter how egregious
4244098 this proposal was universally condemned by everyone not associated with the government including a wide range of native leaders
4244099 never went beyond conceptual testimony to the senate indian affairs committee and it contained no specific amount to settle the cobell litigation
4244100 this is not an offer instead it is a slap in the face for every individual with trust fund litigation
4244101 lawyers for the justice department and the interior department have made clear throughout the cobell litigation that the governments firm position is that the individual indian money iim trust is not a real trust and that indians are owed nothing no matter how much money and other assets are missing or have been looted from the trust
4244102 the position of the cobell plaintiffs has long been that we will consider reasonable offers from the united states to resolve this case
4244103 this highly sought after corner commercial property resulted in an intense bidding war driving the price well over the asking price

4244128 actually i do know of a few officers i could talk to about army jobs i might be able to do
4244129 the report which specifically addressed speculation appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4244130 does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices
4244131 we are greatly disturbed that although cftc staff obviously knew that underlying data used to prepare the interim report was seriously flawed the interim report was nonetheless publicly released
4244132 why it was released after the cftc staff had determined that critical information upon which it was based was inaccurate
4244133 in light of the recent increases in energy prices and the resulting concerns of the public and policy makers
4244134 a year from now we will be talking about how much less share in search they have
4244135 the whole team really pulled together we were working for each other and supporting each other im really happy and its very exciting because a lot of people didnt believe in us after the european championship last year but we really proved ourselves today
4244136 i was not pleased with the piaffe but in general it was good although there were some small mistakes it could be that i was trying for too much and in the end i got less my first mistake was in my first extended trot
4244137 i dont know what to say i just feel awful i know ive finished the team
4244138 it felt terrible and i knew when we got to the pirouettes it was just a bad day she was much different in the warm up it took me by surprise as much as anything else
4244139 i almost wanted to do too much but i had to be safe for the team in the grand prix special and the kur i can take risks this was not the time
4244140 the first two results from holland were just not good enough but the draw didnt help although on the other hand we should have had a better performance and another country was better than we were
4244141 i am getting older and i have already been spoiled with two unbelievable horses unless somebody offers me another wonderful horse i cannot see myself going to london
4244142 im very pleased because for three days max had a high temperature and i had to wait and see if he would come right
4244143 however for the last few days he felt better and i thought he could be competitive again although he was almost too fresh tonight
4244144 his breeding is orlov trotter and i have been riding him for six years
4244145 tonight i think he felt like he was doing crowd control again because he didnt want to walk and was looking around the stadium but then he settled and i was very pleased with how he went
4244146 heike gave us a positive base from which to start and then nadine did a good test too so i knew it was important to be safe and that i could not afford to make a mistake
4244147 i went in with a really good feeling because the other riders had done a good job but it was a lot of pressure because last year we lost gold to the netherlands at the europeans and we knew it was time to wake up we didnt like it
4244148 the netherlands and germany are partners really because we fight against each other and it makes great sport but outside the ring we can drink a glass of champagne together
4244149 i really think it demonstrates that the time for solar has come its not some small niche thing anymore for rooftops
4244150 as costs have come down the cost of alternatives have gone up so were rapidly reaching a tipping point

4244172 facebook is already a place where people are acting on their interests and ideals connecting with each other and sharing information that can lead to meaningful change
4244173 through this partnership with servicenation we can be part of an historic effort to inspire americans to act together to get more directly involved in and connected to their real life communities
4244174 facebook has itself made history by helping millions across the world to come together by connecting and communicating in an easy to use state of the art online environment
4244175 using facebooks highly regarded organizing tools we hope to channel the idealism and energy of our citizens into real world action that can promote the ideal of voluntary service

4244179 this is not something thats high on our radar screen its not something weve had a lot of complaints about
4244180 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4244181 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4244182 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4244183 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4244184 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4244185 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
4244186 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it
4244187 a little rebellion now and then is a good thing it is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government
4244188 god forbid there should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure

4244208 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4244209 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4244210 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4244211 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4244212 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4244213 we are clear eyed about the sort of media age we live in

4244233 like all scottish children growing up in the 1980s i was virtually forced to drink irn bru on a daily basis
4244234 if id known then that body builders were secretly drinking it to build up their small parts i would never have touched the stuff
4244235 you only have to look at the poor girl to see what a devastating effect irn bru has had on her life she used to be a pretty wee thing look at her now for fucks sake shed stop traffic
4244236 a lot of women become more masculine looking as they get older its the process of ageing im afraid i suggest that ms beazer needs to accept that she is no longer a spring chicken anyway some men prefer the older women id still give her one

4244251 it is fair to say that modern technology has been inconsistently deployed across campus
4244252 there were pockets of relatively up to date technology and internet access was often available but outages are not uncommon and bandwidth is somewhat limited but if they want to be competitive in todays world there is no other choice and they understand that

4244259 the highs were the residents who called with their support and encouragement for taking a position on the boroughs expenditures
4244260 the lows were the criticisms of my position capped by a pair of newspaper articles
4244261 at the time i voted against the two proposals we did not have a budget and the process seemed bogged down
4244262 we all disagree on issues or items and whether we think spending is appropriate for a particular item
4244263 but i do think that holding up the bills of an entire town is not the appropriate way for council members to act and i would hope that we can resolve things by discussion either during or before meetings and not by taking stands and in effect holding certain items hostage until other officials or council members take action

4244269 still it is good to hear from her shes not in nursing school right now she dropped out after one semester and hasnt returned to it yet she says shes home schooling some mexican children and plans to lead some daily vacation bible schools this summer there in the el paso area
4244270 it doesnt matter though at least i heard from her
4244271 is it that i have done or said something that offended him
4244272 please contact me if you know what the problem concerns
4244273 sometimes i think you become too much involved in my personal affairs really mom sometimes i feel you are desperately trying to get me married off i can make that decision for myself whenever i feel it is the right time
4244274 i am concerned about you and the other two boys as well i want you to find good wives and have happy lives and give me some grandchildren
4244275 whats the rush mom im only twenty one you know i have enough common sense to know what kind of person i want for a wife i dont intend to be pushed into something i really dont want ill decide for myself whether to keep seeing emily
4244276 sure she is but thats not reason enough to get serious enough to talk about marriage
4244277 i must pick the one who is right for me
4244278 i dont know that shes the one for me but it could be the case i dont know yet
4244279 so its rather useless for emily to think seriously about you isnt it
4244280 it looks bad over around st leon robert you should be real careful as you drive home this looks like tornado weather to me
4244281 take it easy ill be praying for you as you drive god is in control he has a plan for everything remember all things work together for good
4244282 we wondered if the tornado missed you over at buckingham our little town is hurtint pretty badly
4244283 there are a lot of electric lines down here and its not safe to come through tell mom and kerry that im ok ill be home when were sure weve found everybody go on home and keep mom and kerry inside you never know what may have blown onto our farm well check tomorrow
4244284 the tornado twisted around something crazy it didnt hit sam coopers house next door but it hit two houses about a quarter mile away it was crazy
4244285 to the north thats part of the really bad news honey
4244286 it was hard for him to have to help us get the bodies out they had run to the garage when they realized it was a tornado but it was too late susie and her daughter died in each others arms
4244287 ive got to go to wendell penrods and shoot all his angus cattle
4244288 no that stupid insurance adjuster came out and said that they wont pay for just part of the herd the only way wendell can get insurance payment is to destroy all his cattle even the healthy ones seems crazy to me
4244289 mom penny seems to be glad that the friends church was destroyed
4244290 why is she against that church do you know i cant figure it out
4244291 i used to be a good christian before i got married i attended the church of god there in wilshire ohio we were a very conservative group and god blessed us
4244292 well when we moved to st leon i was looking for a conservative church for you boys to go to for sunday school your grandma lewis was a good christian and she was going to the friends church that was the main reason i decided to send you boys there
4244293 so that doesnt tell me anything bad about the church mom what are you driving at
4244294 well son sometimes i wonder if i made a mistake in sending you there
4244295 i think your grandma will be in heaven shes a good woman
4244296 but we believe in the baptism of the holy spirit
4244297 do you ever take communion son thats the lords supper
4244298 no but i have great communion with god i spend lots of hours reading praying really worshipping in my bedroom i see that as communion
4244299 does the friends church in st leon ever have foot washing services
4244300 why all these questions mom is this what penny and uncle bill and some other people are trying to say to me
4244301 i think it is robert it looks to me as though the friends dont do any of those things that most churches do regularly theyre really different cant you see that
4244302 ive never heard any of this at the friends church or at buckingham either for that matter and i feel these are among the best people on earth
4244303 i see all of those activities as biblical expectations jesus was baptized wasnt he and didnt he have communion at the last supper i dont remember all the things i learned as a youngster robert but ive been doing a little studying just in case you and i would ever have this discussion
4244304 i think these people are not living by the bible
4244305 mom could an unsaved person pretend to be a christian and have a preacher baptize him you think so
4244306 and is there any reason why unsaved people cannot pretend to be christians to they can take the bread and wine
4244307 and how about going through some type of ceremony to wash peoples feet no doubt non christians have done that too wouldnt you agree
4244308 still son that doesnt excuse real christians from doing those things
4244309 mom if i were to die tonight do you think i would go to heaven
4244310 i know you would robert i have no doubts at all i can honestly say that i do not know anyone who lives a more careful life than you do youre a real christian youre genuine
4244311 wibels were in an accident on the way home from church this afternoon

4244317 the first people who used the gobero cemetery were kiffian hunter gatherers who grew up to two metres tall
4244318 the most amazing find so far is a grave with a female and two children hugging each other they were carefully arranged in this position this strongly indicated they had spiritual beliefs and cared for their dead
4244319 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
4244320 tibolone which is used around the world for menopausal symptoms decreases the risk of fractures decreases the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of stroke in this group of women who are all over the age of 60
4244321 for older women you should stop taking tibolone or not consider starting it
4244322 women who are having menopausal symptoms in their 50s can continue to take tibolone because it is relatively safe and also does have other benefits such as a reduction in the risk of fracture and breast cancer
4244323 it will not be available in the united states because the company is not asking the u s food and drug administration to approve it
4244324 all drugs that are being used for menopausal symptoms all have positives and negatives the task is to find drugs that dont have problems
4244325 for the u s consumer its sort of a moot point
4244326 it tibolone is not the magic bullet but i think its another drug that could potentially be used if it ever does get fda approval my caution would be that its potentially helpful but its not a slam dunk that its better than what we have been using
4244327 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it

4244343 one of the conditions of the coastal commission involves the subterranean parking garage where well have to dig out several thousand tons of dirt
4244344 the commission didnt want any of that dirt to end up in the creek so they said we have to wait until spring after the rains are over to start that
4244345 that will give us time to get everything sorted out and be ready to go
4244346 i think i have a better project today than i had before
4244347 the coastal commission staff in santa cruz did a fantastic job it was a very good experience dealing with the coastal commission i enjoyed it

4244352 a huge pool of migrant labor from the countryside is basically subsidizing urban development

4244368 over the last few days russia has fired over two dozen ss 21 ballistic short range missiles into the country of georgia integrating ballistic missile strikes with their conventional military forces
4244369 the use of ballistic missiles by russia in this conflict sends an endorsement to the international community that the use of ballistic missiles has value thus propelling countries and terrorist organizations to develop purchase and continue to proliferate ballistic missiles
4244370 this outward military aggression with the use of ballistic missiles from russia on a former ussr country sends a very serious message to all former members of the soviet block especially poland who today made an agreement with the united states to host 10 u

4244389 a francia no la podemos enfrentar de t a t porque t cnicamente son muy superiores

4244403 desde el primer minuto en el micr fono todas las dudas desaparecieron
4244404 se ha metido tanto en la piel de piaf que no se pueden ver las costuras
4244405 su voz es como la de la artista que encarna profunda y amarga e irresistible y durante dos horas ella es piaf
4244406 peque a como lo era la francesa pero tambi n con una gran fuerza en la voz

4244413 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4244414 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4244415 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4244416 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4244417 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4244418 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4244419 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4244420 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4244421 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4244422 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4244423 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4244424 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4244425 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4244426 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4244427 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4244428 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4244429 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4244430 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined

4244447 me queda claro que desde que inici mi carrera me propuse ser como especie de embajador internacional y proponer o invitar un poco a las diferentes culturas
4244448 siempre me voy a vestir de charro y cantar las canciones mexicanas cl sicas y mis cl sicos

4244452 extrapolate these circumstances to the availability of medical services on the two sides and it is clear that even on the doorstep of the global core the medical landscape is anything but flat
4244453 to these and countless others testing the obstacles notions of a flat world remain essentially irrelevant
4244454 i think youll find that this is the real deal
4244455 on the other hand when an extended consciousness is disrupted as exemplified by patients with profound disturbances of autobiographical memory core consciousness remains intact
4244456 it is possible to separate consciousness in general from functions such as wakefulness low level attention working memory conventional memory language and reasoning
4244457 the defect of knowing and self and of recognizably motivated emotion goes hand in hand with defects in planning in high level attention and in sustained and adequate behaviors
4244458 nearly all the sites of brain damage associated with a significant disruption of core consciousness share one important trait these structures are of old evolutionary vintage they are present in numerous nonhuman species and they mature early in individual human development
4244459 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
4244460 organizations such as airlines banks and stock exchange will be given up to two years to adapt and then implementation will begin
4244461 why is this such a good move on their part
4244462 nice recognises that when it is making its decisions it should consider the needs of present and future patients of the nhs who are anonymous and who do not necessarily have people to argue their case on their behalf the institute has not therefore adopted an additional rule of rescue
4244463 if a coyote falls in a canyon and there is no one there to hear it does it make a sound
4244464 although rick warren is well known in religious circles his name is not quite a household name yet
4244465 warren has received recent media attention due in part to his interest in public affairs in particular the issue of aids in africa
4244466 in past years warren hosted a global summit on aids and the church obama spoke there in 2006 and hillary clinton was a speaker in 2007 the participation of these democratic senators upset some religious conservatives what was the basis of their concern
4244467 there were two kinds of objections raised by evangelical critics of warren
4244468 this is similar to some of the criticism that was directed at billy graham in the 1950s and the 1960s
4244469 there is a certain irony in the criticism of warren when evangelical protestants returned to politics with the moral majority in 1979 and 1980 jerry falwell and other leaders had to persuade their fellow evangelicals that christians should be involved in politics because of pressing moral issues many evangelicals of that era and in fact many evangelicals today are not particularly political people they are much more interested in spiritual and religious matters here we are a quarter of a century later and a new generation of evangelicals see a new set of pressing moral issues and are involved in a broader application of their faith in politics
4244470 i dont think i could be where i am today with any other coach

4244472 we had breakfast at 8 we usually have breakfast at 7 but this morning it was at 8 before that he usually takes a shower so at 7 30 he was up and showered we went at 8 for breakfast at 8 30 we were on a bus to the water cube then we did some stretching and warm ups for 30 to 40 minutes then he puts on his competition suit and does more warm ups then he swims and after that he has lactose testing to make sure everythings in order today he had a massage normally he has doping but he didnt today he always has a massage then hell eat take a nap and then come back on the bus and do it all again usually twice a day i always plan those warm ups so they are exactly timed he starts stretching two hours before a race and is in the water an hour and a half before hes always done those things really

4244483 were going to be rotating people in to work on different things and regions and phelps dunbar will bring in people to finish out their offices
4244484 we scaled down the number of units for more green space and a pond instead of squeezing in as much as we could
4244485 this has been the result of many months of planning with lots of input from lots of professionals
4244486 if you commute to work using one of the new synchronized routes which will be parishwide the average driver will save 14 52 per month just on the drive to and from work

4244494 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
4244495 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
4244496 the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over
4244497 this is not intended to be a mere discussion of violations of law that have occurred

4244549 while our comprehensive plan encourages greater density and we desire a greater density in a lot of these corridors i think weve come to an understanding that its not the best thing in every particular piece of property
4244550 we feel like this will give us the ability to a greater density but with the ability to do it where you can impose conditions to mitigate any concerns that we have
4244551 this is about the fourth time weve had this same issue
4244552 right now were wide open if somebody comes in and proposes a building at some of the higher by right densities and we dont have the utilities to support it
4244553 we dont have any ability to deny that by right development because of that rather than put the onus of all those upgrades on the taxpayers individually it shifts some of that burden to the development community
4244554 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4244555 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4244556 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4244557 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4244558 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4244559 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4244646 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
4244647 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
4244648 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
4244649 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
4244650 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
4244651 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
4244652 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
4244653 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region
4244654 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4244655 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4244656 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4244657 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4244658 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families
4244659 this is the first picture of a clay sized particle on mars and the size agrees with predictions from the colors seen in sunsets on the red planet
4244660 taking this image required the highest resolution microscope operated off earth and a specially designed substrate to hold the martian dust
4244661 we always knew it was going to be technically very challenging to image particles this small
4244662 im delighted that this microscope is producing images that will help us understand mars at the highest detail ever
4244663 this is proof of the microscopes potential we are now ready to start doing scientific experiments that will add a new dimension to measurements being made by other phoenix lander instruments
4244664 after this first success were now working on building up a portrait gallery of the dust on mars
4244665 instead of protecting the individuals that were infected with the high pathogenic virus the immune response is actually contributing to the lethality of the virus
4244666 the h5n1 virus can also cause very serious disease and it appears to do this in a way that is quite similar to the 1918 virus

4244673 norm is a word used to refer both to proscriptive standards and descriptive accounts
4244674 i dont think we can proclaim that scientific work is basically trustworthy
4244675 i think that seeing the problems actually saddles us with some responsibilty to do something about them
4244676 im not sure whether were in a position to say with certainty if this is a matter of a few bad apples or an orchard where all the trees are diseased and overrun with coddling moth caterpillars

4244691 both sides agree that it is in the best interest of party unity and making sure that everyones voice and vote is honored to make sure her name is put into nomination
4244692 its to honor everyone who worked so hard on both sides
4244693 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4244694 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4244695 this wasnt something she was itching for looking for but so many of her supporters said it was important to them and the obama people got how important it was to smooth over any tensions and that it was the right thing to do
4244696 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week he said
4244697 potentially down the track thats where it might head he said
4244698 i think weve got some time to go before we get to that though i think weve got to stick solid with the sanctity of the contract

4244704 tensions between the united states and russia sharpened as the bush administration suggested that russias objective is the ousting of president mikhail saakashvili who has close ties to the united states and is seeking admission to nato
4244705 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
4244706 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
4244707 as far as the georgians are concerned south ossetia and abkhazia are simply part of their national territory to be recovered at all costs promises by nato leaders to bring georgia into the alliance and ostentatious declarations of support from washington have emboldened saakashvili to launch his military offensive against the two provinces south ossetia and abkhazia saakashvili and likely dick cheneys office in washington appear to have miscalculated very badly russia has made it clear that it has no intention of ceding its support for south ossetia or abkhazia
4244708 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
4244709 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland
4244710 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4244711 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4244712 they both unloaded on me and i started seeing stars and the whole thing was just bam bam bam after that
4244713 someone had a chokehold and they were all on top of me and i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die
4244714 there has been significant geopolitical activity but its not our role to upset it
4244715 we are not planning to attack anyone but our partners should clearly understand that the armed forces will be used if necessary to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the russian federation and its allies including on a preventative basis including with the use of nuclear weapons
4244716 military force can and must be used to demonstrate the decisiveness of the top leadership of the country
4244717 what baluyev sky means is the enhanced deterrence doctrine which was created in the united states
4244718 soon we will not be able to maintain missile defense
4244719 under these conditions a potential enemy will gain the ability to carry out high precision strikes coordinated in terms of time and space on practically any target on russian territory
4244720 as for our allies we will see whos ready to join our nuclear umbrella

4244741 the cost estimate includes expenses for implementing hardware software infrastructure implementation resource costs and added labor costs for operating a track and trace system not withstanding other substantial costs for pharmacies to build and maintain data centers to manage the required information and investment costs for pharmacy distribution centers the financial cost of implementing a track and trace system could reach upwards of two percent of total annual pharmacy sales in the first year in an industry that only averages an annual net profit margin of three percent
4244742 track and trace technology is still years away from widespread deployment in the u s supply chain

4244755 it appears that the pakistani troops wanted to cause and escalate tensions by repeatedly violating the ceasefire
4244756 we note with regret the statement made by the oic secretary general on the situation in the indian state of jammu and kashmir
4244757 the oic has once again chosen to comment upon jammu and kashmir and indias internal affairs on which it has no locus standi we reject such comments
4244758 the ongoing excessive and unwarranted use of force against the kashmiri people
4244759 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4244760 so ericks like no way spacey your posts suck and shes like nuh uh
4244761 wait it gets better so then spacey posts something about national politics instead of local politics and ericks like dude that is so messed up and spaceys like no way and then erick totally
4244762 and then spaceys all mad and calls erick names and says he cant parent his children or something and then she says he totally mixes his metaphors and i think she took him off her top 8 friends at myspace and hes soooo totally not getting any more text messages from her
4244763 so then ericks like i had to do it cause youre screwing things up and then spacey goes all blah blah blah and then peach pundit goes down for scheduled maintenance or something for like a zillion hours last night
4244764 and then everyone starts taking sides and stuff and i think were all gonna meet in the courtyard and fight at recess lol
4244765 we have never interfered in pakistans internal matters pakistan should do the same
4244766 every pakistani is with our brothers and sisters in srinagar kashmir beats in the heart of every pakistani
4244767 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4244768 we have received the dna test results which confirms that the body is not that of meghna
4244769 the parents are happy that the dna test does not match this means that there is hope that meghna might be alive
4244770 initially on the basis of certain identification marks i said the body is that of my daughter but my wife raised doubts and it seems to be true
4244771 i consulted my doctor friends and they said the fracture on the collar bone and fibroid cannot be considered as identification marks as it can happen to anyone
4244772 our officials are trying to establish as to how the incident took place because the dead girl admitted to having been homesick
4244773 the deceased arrived in india on aug 9 according to her course mates staying in a hostel to take part in the programme she felt dejected due to a complete absence of friends and a language handicap since she did not know either english or tamil
4244774 the parents and younger sibling have been informed on the phone and they will start for india from frankfurt early friday the body will be preserved in cold storage here till their arrival after which a post mortem examination will be conducted by doctors
4244775 let the people of the state maintain peace and harmony in this difficult hour in keeping with their glorious traditions
4244776 i was fast asleep when loud noises and slogan shouting woke me up it was like the early 1990s everybody was on the road in our area but hardly anybody had any idea about what actually had happened
4244777 you can continue with the protests in peaceful manner but please stay away from indulging in violence
4244778 the government is not listening to us i hereby end my life for the cause
4244779 one wonders how suddenly car 2007 was thought to be of great benefit to the petitioners
4244780 as a template for its own actions in the pro russian separatist regions of the former ussr
4244781 there was a strong body of thought in the russian political and diplomatic worlds that believed russian recognition of south ossetian and abkhaz independence would be morally and politically justified
4244782 embarked on an orgy of looting burning murdering and rape witnesses claimed adding that the irregulars had carried off young girls and men
4244783 they grabbed him round the shoulder and slit his throat
4244784 there were five of them they had arrived from south ossetia in a jeep they were going across the village from house to house
4244785 there are bodies everywhere i saw hundreds of dead there are people lying in the streets
4244786 the villages of kurta chala and eredvi are full of corpses
4244787 they asked me where my basement was and shot it up
4244788 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4244789 we do not want georgians to return here again we will build a base for peacekeepers in villages like nul they will belong to russia and to south ossetia
4244790 fortunately the theft happened in view of russian army commanders who would not stand up for that sort of behavior
4244791 the result was to fan hatred for georgians among neighbours who had previously been friendly to them she said
4244792 technical violations of the propane code were discovered such as a hose hanging from a truck
4244793 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states
4244794 id like to see us doing more rpg type games its an area were looking at we have some things underway that i cant announce i think its one of those areas where it can bring a lot of the storytelling and character creation aspects that are very important for us in other parts of our company as well and so its just a natural area for us to get involved in if you look at how the world of rpgs is changing and in fact game genres are changing or blending i dont think well necessarily be looking to create the hardest core rpg out there but a blended heavy rpg influenced game title is something we feel comfortable we can create through our existing studios with the right teams leading them
4244795 im more about the show i like to get dressed up and go crazy my cannonball dives are pretty basic im not the best cannonball diver i will admit but the performance is a big aspect this is going to the olympics baby youll see me there in 2012
4244796 unfortunately at this time we are unable to process warranty requests in ireland if you know anyone in the united states or united kingdom that we could send a replacement pedal to for you we can do that
4244797 cre que hab amos dejado el mundo de batman en un lugar interesante en la primera pel cula y el final suger a una direcci n intrigante en la que la historia pudiera continuar
4244798 al final de batman begins insinuamos la amenaza de una escalada en el sentido de que al perseguir los c rteles del crimen de la ciudad y atacando sus intereses batman podr a provocar una respuesta a n mayor por parte de la comunidad de criminales y ahora hay que ver d nde ha llegado eso hay consecuencias muy negativas en la cruzada que prepara sobre gotham city
4244799 por una parte batman ha comenzado a librar a gotham del crimen y la corrupci n que ha asolado a la ciudad pero ir nicamente el vac o que ha creado atrae a un elemento delictivo incluso m s poderoso que lo considera como una oportunidad de apoderarse de la ciudad
4244800 en batman begins nos centramos en gran medida en los or genes del personaje c mo batman evolucion a partir del propio trauma inicial de bruce wayne sus temores su rabia y por ltimo su resoluci n de luchar contra el delito y la corrupci n
4244801 es que el playboy multimillonario bruce wayne con sus fabulosos coches una hermosa mujer de cada brazo y sin preocupaci n alguna no es en absoluto la persona que realmente es as que mientras que bruce wayne lleva puesta una mascara para ocultar su identidad como batman es realmente batman quien define la aut ntica identidad de bruce y el personaje p blico de bruce wayne es la m scara que se coloca para coexistir en este mundo
4244802 creo que bruce pens que ser a algo finito que batman servir a como una inspiraci n para gotham city y que finalmente ser a capaz de dejar atr s a este personaje que hab a concebido pero llega a comprender cada vez m s que esto no es algo que pueda abandonar ahora o posiblemente nunca hay nuevos enemigos de los que proteger la ciudad
4244803 a su manera joker es tambi n un icono como lo es el caballero oscuro y eso nos brind una oportunidad y un desaf o en lo que se refiere a explorar el punto de vista distorsionado del personaje
4244804 comenzamos a estudiar el efecto que un tipo as podr a tener sobre una poblaci n entera las formas en que l podr a alterar el equilibrio para las personas las formas en que podr a adoptar sus normas de vida su tica sus creencias su humanidad y despu s utilizar todo eso contra esas personas se podr a decir que hemos visto reminiscencias de todo esto en nuestro propio mundo lo que me ha llevado a creer que la anarqu a y el caos incluso la amenaza de la anarqu a y el caos est n entre las cosas m s aterradoras que la sociedad afronta en estos d as y en esta poca
4244805 joker es alguien sin ning n tipo de normas en absoluto
4244806 c mo se puede luchar contra alguien que est empe ado en la destrucci n incluso si eso significa la autodestrucci n se trata de un enemigo temible
4244807 batman tiene un c digo moral muy estricto sobre lo que debe o no debe hacer y joker puede usar eso en su propio beneficio batman sigue teniendo una enorme reserva de rabia y dolor y sabe que f cilmente podr a ir demasiado lejos por lo que no debe cruzar esa l nea tiene que asegurarse de que al perseguir a un monstruo no se convierta l mismo en un monstruo chris nolan ha planteado cuestiones ticas interesantes en esta pel cula sobre las complicaciones de tener poder frente a aspirar al poder
4244808 creo que chris tiene un magn fico talento para satisfacer la necesidad de un paseo en monta a rusa haci ndolo por puro entretenimiento sin renunciar a momentos de grandes conflictos personales y la dualidad dentro de los personajes se encarga de hacer ambas cosas sin comprometer ninguna de ellas
4244809 harvey es un hombre del pueblo es un h roe genuinamente americano en una forma diferente a batman
4244810 as que ahora tenemos el triunvirato de batman harvey dent y el teniente gordon el sistema de la justicia la polic a y un justiciero que forman una alianza para derribar al mundo del crimen utilizar a batman les da un margen de ventaja sobre los criminales pero sigue estando la polic a que les arrestar y despu s ser n juzgados mediante el sistema de justicia pero lo que se plantea es la cuesti n de si se pueden forzar las normas sin quebrantarlas y eso se convierte en la trama subyacente del argumento
4244811 la esperanza que harvey representa para gotham city y despu s la tragedia de lo que le ocurre a l y su transformaci n en dos caras es una historia extraordinaria
4244812 joker es el villano m s extravagante por lo que exige atenci n pero de alguna manera harvey dent dos caras es el personaje m s convincente porque tiene un margen de acci n muy sorprendente nuestro joker no tiene margen de acci n per se simplemente tiene una gran necedad de principio a fin joker y harvey dent stos son dos de los personajes m s fascinantes de los comics de batman tienen una cualidad casi m tica y fue apasionante verles a trav s del prisma del mundo que nosotros creamos
4244813 a la hora de continuar la historia de batman el desaf o era hacer las cosas mejor ampliar el mundo que hab amos creado en la primera pel cula tanto por medio de la historia como en la forma en que la present bamos
4244814 yo estaba asombrado por la forma en que qued la fotograf a imax introduce al p blico justo a la acci n de una forma que ning n otro formato de pel cula podr a hacerlo me lleva a la poca en la que yo era un ni o e iba a ver pel culas y experimentaba el alcance las dimensiones y la grandeza que el gran cine puede ofrecer como cineasta creo que siempre se est intentando volver a eso y ampliar el lienzo de nuestra historia con imax parec a una magn fica forma de hacerlo
4244815 ciertamente bruce se est sacrificando tanto mental como f sicamente como consecuencia de este personaje de batman a quien l ha dado rienda suelta y ahora es incapaz de refrenar m s que una persona l ha creado un s mbolo y ese s mbolo no puede tener l mites no puede mostrar debilidad nunca por lo tanto tenemos el conflicto entre lo que es bueno para bruce wayne y lo que se debe hacer seg n batman porque las dos cosas no siempre son compatibles
4244816 trabajar con christian es un verdadero placer y sencillamente muy divertido
4244817 tambi n tiene una gran fuerza se centra incre blemente en aprovechar la realidad psicol gica de cualquier personaje que est interpretando aplica el mismo enfoque disciplinado para encontrar la verdad de ese personaje y se ci e a ella es de una gran ayuda para m como cineasta porque s que est preparado y sabe muy bien c mo se va a mover su personaje por la historia de hecho posee gran parte de las cualidades que bruce wayne pone de relieve al transformarse de un hombre ordinario en esta extraordinaria figura de lucha contra el crimen
4244818 christian aport a su interpretaci n todo lo que se podr a desear para el personaje la talla moral la resonancia emocional la complejidad
4244819 era sorprendente estar en el plat vi ndole llev su papel a otro nivel en esta pel cula
4244820 en batman begins hubo mucho esfuerzo f sico tuvo que ponerse en forma de manera sorprendente y aprender todo tipo de destrezas en lo que se refiere a c mo lucha batman la forma en que se mueve en esta pel cula yo dir a que se requer a m s bien un proceso interno porque bruce se est dando cuenta del peaje personal de vivir esta doble vida y est cuestionando las elecciones que l ha hecho christian transmite esa lucha emocional de forma muy convincente muchas veces sin decir una palabra
4244821 en el kfm se aprende a desarrollar cada parte del cuerpo como un arma y no es algo f cil
4244822 trabajamos con un christian sumamente duro y fue fant stico ver con qu rapidez asimilaba todo hubo una progresi n definida en su entrenamiento desde la primera pel cula l comprende mucho mejor el kfm por lo que adquiri m s potencia y sus movimientos eran incre bles
4244823 porque utiliza la adrenalina que todo el mundo siente al participar en una situaci n amenazante o violenta eso realmente es algo visceral en lugar del tipo de calma zen a la que apelan algunas artes marciales el kfm se basa en el instinto animal y en poner a punto esos instintos para que sean letales algo que es perfecto para batman
4244824 pero joker no lucha de forma limpia tiene otros ases bajo la manga por lo que se trata m s bien de un juego mental pero encuentra en batman a un oponente muy valioso y creo que l disfruta con eso
4244825 era audacia yo necesitaba a un actor fenomenal pero l tambi n ten a que ser alguien que no tuviera miedo de asumir un papel emblem tico como se heath cre algo totalmente original es sorprendente es cautivador va a enloquecer a la gente
4244826 hablamos sobre c mo ve amos este personaje y ambos ten amos exactamente el mismo concepto que joker ten a que ver con la amenaza de la anarqu a y se deleita con la creaci n del caos y el temor a gran escala heath pareci entender instintivamente c mo hacer ese personaje de forma diferente a cualquier cosa que se hubiera hecho antes
4244827 joker es uno de los grandes villanos del mundo del c mic psic pata enigm tico astuto diab lico encantador divertido y algo totalmente cautivador sab amos que se necesitar a a un extraordinario actor para interpretarlo y que heath se entreg en todos los sentidos desde cualquier matiz f sico hasta cada expresi n verbal simplemente es una actuaci n inolvidable
4244828 nunca quisimos hacer una historia sobre el origen de joker en esta pel cula sino que quer amos mostrar el ascenso de este personaje
4244829 en cierto sentido joker es la respuesta l gica a batman que ha provocado este tipo de comportamiento extremo en gotham
4244830 joker desea destruir a batman para demostrar que todo el mundo tiene un precio e incluso se puede ejercer influencia sobre batman de tal forma que ponga en peligro sus principios realmente creo que est encantado de descubrir que batman no har eso y crea para joker un oponente incluso mejor en este juego que est jugando es un personaje fant stico y heath hizo un extraordinario trabajo con eso no creo que la pel cula hubiera funcionado igual si no hubi ramos tenido un actor del calibre de heath ledger que fue capaz realmente de subir las apuestas en gran medida como joker lo hizo en gotham
4244831 quer amos que joker representara el mal puro y no adulterado en el sentido de que no tiene motivaci n l gica para sus acciones eso es lo que quer amos desencadenar en gotham city se trata de un desastre
4244832 l es muy divertido s que suena algo extra o porque c mo puede ser divertido alguien tan deplorable la puesta en escena del papel por parte de heath no fue algo exagerado sino que sigui siendo divertid simo tanto f sicamente como en una forma seca y sard nica con joker creo que te encontrar s a ti mismo horrorizado y aterrorizado pero al mismo tiempo te diviertes
4244833 harvey se ha encargado de enfrentarse al crimen organizado y de limpiar las calles es la nueva y brillante esperanza de gotham city el caballero oscuro como se le llama comienza lleno de optimismo y entusiasmo aunque donde l termina es algo completamente diferente
4244834 es un magn fico papel y soy un gran fan de chris nolan por lo que cuando l me pidi que participara en la pel cula no lo pens dos veces
4244835 est bamos buscando a alguien que pudiera encarnar ese encanto genuinamente americano porque tienes que poner de relieve a una figura heroica y muy atractiva al principio de la pel cula pero l tambi n deb a tener un contraste ten a que sugerir ese trasfondo de rabia y oscuridad que harvey dent necesitaba tener de forma que el transcurso de la historia sea cre ble no se puede presentar a un personaje como ste simplemente como a una figura heroica sin defectos sin un lado oscuro aaron capt todas esas cualidades muy muy bien
4244836 rachel tom la desgarradora decisi n de que es imposible para ella estar con bruce siempre que l sea batman
4244837 pero para m quiero decir que es christian bale y aaron eckhart y ambos son bastante espectaculares como actriz fue f cil vivir ese dilema
4244838 mi deseo de formar parte de esta pel cula ten a casi todo que ver con chris nolan y el resto del reparto desde el principio chris estuvo encantador y muy interesado por mis ideas sobre el papel l ten a claro que quer a que rachel fuera inteligente y eficaz y no la damisela afligida aunque ella est desconsolada a veces realmente somos buenos el uno para el otro porque eso es en gran medida lo que yo quer a y nos empuja el uno al otro de formas diferentes para hacer de rachel lo que es
4244839 gordon podr a haber sido un papel comparativamente sencillo especialmente rodeado de los personajes m s exc ntricos e incluso bizarros pero gary aport mucho colorido a su interpretaci n
4244840 en la primera pel cula gordon era un personaje muy reservado requer a un actor que pudiera interpretar un papel importante pero de una forma muy sutil y comedida estaba encantado de poder volver a contar con gary para gordon pero en una historia que desaf a al personaje m s y permite que gary muestre m s de aquello en lo que es grande
4244841 el v nculo entre ellos es muy claro pero se ven las diferentes partes de sus relaciones
4244842 lucius fox es totalmente consciente de lo que bruce est haciendo como batman y lo aprueba en gran medida pero en el transcurso de la pel cula comprobamos los l mites de lo que lucius considera aceptable en t rminos de lo que bruce hace como batman
4244843 veo a lucius como una persona pragm tica al hacer lo que se tiene que hacer para facilitar la misi n de este hombre batman se ha erigido a s mismo como un adalid de la justicia y una vez que ha establecido esa ida y el mundo cuenta con l tiene que dar lo mejor de s mismo pero lucius cuestiona si hay l mites sobre lo que l har para ayudar a bruce a cumplir ese reto
4244844 el reparto es un magn fico conjunto de algunos de los actores de m s extraordinario talento que trabajan en el cine lo que hizo que fuera apasionante que todos participaran cre un magn fico ambiente en el plat y fue m gico ver a actores con enfoques muy diferentes reunirse y trabajar duro para conseguir los mismos objetivos
4244845 con batman begins conseguimos mostrar c mo se desarrollaron cosas tales como el
4244846 por supuesto que bamos a tener de nuevo el batm vil
4244847 pero quer amos dar a batman algo nuevo un medio de transporte renovado algo muy ex tico y de aspecto muy potente se trata de un veh culo de dos ruedas pero definitivamente no es una motocicleta en esencia el batpod es al mundo de las motos lo que el tumbler es al mundo de los coches
4244848 nos planteamos hagamos eso construy moslo a tama o natural y as lo hicimos conseguimos unas herramientas y creamos un modelo a tama o natural a partir de algo que descubrimos que podr a valer
4244849 en primer lugar recuerdo cuando chris nolan me mostr por primera vez la idea para el batm vil
4244850 parec a horrorizado por el hecho de que tuviera que mecanizar aquello realmente seguimos llev ndole tazas de t y l simplemente estaba all sentado mir ndolo pareciendo como si pensase oh dios m o a qu hora sale el pr ximo vuelo era el conflicto de dise o habitual frente a la ingenier a
4244851 me qued all en silencio fingiendo que estaba reflexionando pero lo que me pasaba por la cabeza era que ambos ten an que estar mal de la cabeza d nde iba yo a poner un tren transmisor de potencia y con esas impresionantes ruedas realmente esto podr a girar hab a muchas cuestiones
4244852 realmente deber a funcionar pero de alg n modo chris y su equipo encontraron una forma de hacerlo
4244853 no creo que chris o nathan hubieran montado en una motocicleta en su vida as que desconoc an por completo los mecanismos necesarios para que aquello se moviera de alguna forma era beneficioso porque ellos no iban encaminados a una moto ortodoxa ni siquiera de forma subconsciente el hecho de que no tuvieran ni idea de mec nica les ayud a crear este extra o y maravilloso veh culo
4244854 el producto acabado con el que chris y su equipo aparecieron era muy sorprendente muy eficaz y funcionaba muy bien pero es incre blemente dif cil conducirlo y manejarlo
4244855 he trabajado con jeanpierre un par de veces y es uno de los mejores pilotos de motos del mundo si no es el mejor
4244856 quer amos que el nuevo batitraje fuera un equipo m s gil con mayor maniobrabilidad y capacidad para respirar como una moderna armadura en lugar de un traje de goma
4244857 hab a esencialmente tres componentes principales en el batitraje de batman begins y en esta pel cula hab a m s de 100 por lo que era un traje muy complicado a eso debemos a adirle que cada una de esas piezas ten a que ser modelada y despu s moldeada y fundida cada pieza tambi n ten a que ser reproducida docenas de veces para los m ltiples batitrajes necesarios para toda la producci n fue una extraordinaria cantidad de trabajo
4244858 anteriormente batman siempre ha tenido que mover los hombros para girar la cabeza por lo que eso era una prioridad definitiva
4244859 era mucho m s c modo y mucho menos claustrof bico que el primer traje tambi n era m s gil y me daba una mayor gama de movimientos lo que me ayud con las secuencias de acci n y lucha pero me segu a dando esa sensaci n de invencibilidad
4244860 no puedes ayudar si no te sientes protegido y m s poderoso cuando te pones el batitraje simplemente funciona
4244861 pasamos mucho tiempo perfeccionando la capa para la primera pel cula y no quer amos cambiarla
4244862 cuando me enter de que joker iba a ser interpretado por heath ledger yo quise que el traje tuviera un estilo m s joven y moderno que las versiones anteriores b sicamente mi investigaci n abarc desde vivienne westwood hasta johnny rotten a iggy pop a pete doherty o a alexander mcqueen estaba recopilando todo tipo de im genes
4244863 tiene una actitud algo petimetre al que se le ha incorporado algo de estilo grunge
4244864 heath quer a que fuera delgada por lo que es una corbata de los a os 60 pero en un tejido de turnbull amp asser me atrevo a decir que es la corbata m s rara que turnbull amp asser ha creado nunca
4244865 cuando heath entr y le mostramos cada una de las partes del vestuario pens que era fant sticamente original y enseguida lo aprob
4244866 heath har a crujir su cara en expresiones espec ficas elevando su frente y bizqueando los ojos y yo pintar a de blanco sus contornos faciales mediante esta t cnica se crearon texturas y expresiones que simplemente pintando la cara de un blanco plano no se conseguir a entonces utilic maquillaje negro alrededor de los ojos de heath mientras que l los ten a muy cerrados con lo que conseguimos texturas faciales consistentes despu s de pintar el negro roci agua sobre sus ojos y l apretaba los ojos y sacud a la cabeza y entonces creamos toda esa cosa o a y emborronada de color negro
4244867 utilizaron un nuevo proceso basado en silicona que permite que la pr tesis se coloque sobre la piel de tal forma que no se vean uniones
4244868 es absolutamente sorprendente porque puedes colocar una c mara justo en la cara incluso una c mara imax y no hay ning n problema
4244869 nos llev unos dos a os desarrollar la tecnolog a pero despu s de algunos fallos t cnicos dimos con ella actualmente somos capaces de fabricar piezas de silicona que se apliquen directamente sobre la piel y se mezcla con la piel perfectamente si no supieras que est ah te costar a mucho darte cuenta
4244870 para las pr tesis de joker antes se tardaba tranquilamente de dos a cuatro horas en lugar de eso ahora nos llev unos 25 minutos y ten an un aspecto mucho mejor lo cual era estupendo
4244871 sabato vado a cercare ancora un po cosi poi sistemo tutto

4244873 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4244874 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4244875 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4244876 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4244877 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4244878 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4244879 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4244880 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4244881 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

4244883 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4244884 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4244885 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4244886 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4244887 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4244888 whats an appropriate draw down rate what about inflation how do i budget for inevidable medical costs

4244890 studies that include only liquidated funds such as the one by kaplan and schoar have a
4244891 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
4244892 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
4244893 one of the young uns at ravenwood arabians in ronan montana grabs a bite as the invaders from north idaho come to take a look at the baby herd

4244905 we continue to work on and have incurred significant patent license and enforcement costs in the first half of 2008 without a new settlement or license agreement being recognized although no assurances can be given we anticipate that we will be able to finalize a settlement agreement during the second half of 2008
4244906 i believe that the high level of innovation of our people will result in significant new products in e billing eim and voip applications which positions us well to meet the growing demand of fixed mobile convergence markets
4244907 one thing thats changed dramatically is the cost of media
4244908 you didnt used to spend as much then people started the vanity spending oscar campaigns for brand identification spending your profit to get recognition everyone looks good in the media but the accountant in the back room gets the bill two years later and says what the hell were they doing
4244909 what is a million dollars against 8 million cubans who love me

4244913 my goal was to be the greatest athlete who ever lived
4244914 i think that our system is trying to treat everybody under a particular brand and it doesnt work
4244915 and because of that were creating housing problems were creating employment problems were creating community problems and its needless and its not warranted
4244916 my evolution in this whole process if its meant to create positive change then great im all for that
4244917 so large companies are not done and i think the reason for that is through mergers and acquisitions they acquire new companies with new data centers

4244923 cerpenista itu situs yang dibuat oleh kawan saya herman saksono blogger yang tinggal di yogyakarta cerpenista menyediakan layanan menulis cerita pendek sambung menyambung secara daring atawa online writing melalui cerpenista seorang blogger dapat menulis cerita bersama blogger lain yang belum tentu saling mengenal melalui jaringan internet sabtu pekan lalu cerpenista secara resmi diperkenalkan ke publik di yogyakarta pada acara itu herman juga mengumumkan kerja samanya dengan pt dagdigdug indonesia penyedia layanan sebagai tempat bernaung cerpenista
4244924 oh keren juga ya lalu bagaimana caranya agar saya bisa ikut menulis mas
4244925 sampean harus mendaftar dulu secara daring online ke situs cerpenista gratis kok setelah mendapat persetujuan dari admin sampean baru bisa menyumbang tulisan tapi tulisan sampean ndak boleh panjang bukan dalam bentuk satu cerpen utuh setiap posting dibatasi maksimal 250 karakter di kolom yang sudah disediakan sampean juga baru bisa menulis lagi setelah kalimat buatan sampean tadi diteruskan oleh penulis lain
4244926 memang begitu perbedaan cerpenista dengan situs cerpen lain yang sudah ada sebelumnya misalnya situs fanstory di cerpenista seorang anggota adalah penggagas cerita penulis sutradara sekaligus pembaca anggota ikut menentukan tema alur dan plot cerita

4244928 we just had nine supreme court justices look at her and say you know what you knew you were breaking the law and you did it anyways
4244929 she should have some semblance of honor and just resign i dont know how many people need to tell her that
4244930 any wrongful conduct that affects interrupts or interferes with the performance of official duty
4244931 is supported by the record and demonstrated by the fact that the port commission had to hold a public meeting in order to undo comm daviss contract with dinsmore
4244932 whether accepting the allegations as true the charges on their face support the conclusion that the officer abused his or her position
4244933 we can infer from the record that comm davis understood her duties as port commissioner and the legal necessity of voting in public session before potentially obligating the port in any monetary agreement and for purposes of recall intentionally acted outside the scope of these duties by signing an agreement with dinsmore
4244934 published by the media which directly evidence the misfeasance or malfeasance may suffice to establish petitioners personal knowledge
4244935 her declaration proved it she knew she could not sign into a financial agreement without the boards approval and she went ahead and did it anyway it is that simple
4244936 was not based on a gift of funds but rather a transition process to keep dinsmore in office until a successor was found
4244937 sheri what were you thinking yelling at your daughter she was just trying to have fun with you

4244941 we took the critique to heart that overlord was not evil enough with some of the choices offered as between good and evil

4244951 he he he iya mas blog itu ternyata mengasyikkan ya banyak yang lucu dan unik tapi kalau saya perhatikan mayoritas blog dan blogger itu egois ya mas
4244952 la iya mas para blogger itu rata rata membuat blog sendiri mereka juga mengurus dan mengisinya sendiri itu kan namanya egois mas
4244953 blog memang media pribadi mat ia dibuat dan dikelola oleh seseorang untuk orang lain jadi bisa terkesan egois
4244954 ada nggak blog yang dibuat dan diurus ramai ramai maksud saya adakah blog yang hidup dan matinya ditentukan bukan hanya oleh si pemilik blog
4244955 banyak mat itu namanya blog partisipasi ini blog yang dibuat oleh seseorang tapi siapa saja boleh ikut mengisinya melalui mekanisme submit sampean misalnya boleh ikut mengirim teks foto atau dua duanya ke blog seperti itu jika sang pemilik mengizinkan karya sampean pasti akan ditayangkan blog ini biasanya mengambil satu topik khusus misalnya fotografi desain cerita pendek dan sebagainya
4244956 kebetulan ada seorang teman yang baru saja membangun blog mugue ini blog yang diniatkan sebagai tempat membahas tentang mug cangkir gelas pokoknya alat minum di luar sedotan dan sendok menurut pembuatnya adminoto kosen blog itu dinamai mugue karena orang sering berkata ini mug gue atau mana mug gue mas adminoto mengatakan blog mugue muncul setelah ia melihat dalam kehidupan sehari hari baik di rumah maupun di tempat kerja ada banyak mug atau cangkir bahkan setiap orang menjadikannya sebagai properti pribadi ia lalu menyimpulkan bahwa mug adalah bagian dari kebudayaan karena blog juga mengemban fungsi yang salah satunya adalah tempat berbagi maka dibuatlah blog itu kemunculan mugue menambah jumlah blog partisipasi yang sudah ada misalnya cerita kaos pesan lewat adalah blog yang hanya memajang foto foto tentang lukisan grafiti stiker dan coretan lucu di bak truk bus angkot dan kendaraan umum lain foto foto itu dikirim oleh para pembacanya sedangkan cerita kaos adalah blog yang memamerkan kaus kaus milik pembacanya blog itu menganggap orang bisa saja mempunyai kaus yang sama tapi cerita di balik kaus itu berbeda beda alangkah indahnya jika kisah di balik sebuah kaus itu disampaikan kepada publik melalui blog kalau sampean punya kaus yang lucu unik dan berkesan kirimkan saja foto beserta ceritanya ke sana blog partisipasi memiliki beberapa kelebihan dibanding blog pribadi misalnya karena dikerjakan oleh beberapa orang corak dan gaya posting nya lebih variatif dibanding blog pribadi dan ini yang penting orang lain merasa ikut dilibatkan ada partisipasi sesuai dengan fitrah blog sebagai media sosial sampean juga mau bikin mat

4244969 lady hopes account of my fathers views on religion is quite untrue i have publicly accused her of falsehood but have not seen any reply
4244970 such was the state of christian feeling in this country at the beginning of the present century the early 1800s we may at least hope that nothing of the kind now prevails
4244971 government can neither encourage or discourage religion it must be completely neutral
4244972 when an agency of government acts to allow the building of a mosque it is in violation of the first amendment because it is encouraging the establishment of a religion

4244989 christianity neither is nor ever was a part of the common law
4244990 the civil governments functions with complete success by the total separation of the church from the state
4244991 erecting the wall of separation between church and state is absolutely essential in a free society
4244992 government leaders malign their peers for service that reflects personal convictions and beliefs
4244993 i dont know that atheists should be regarded as citizens nor should they be regarded as patriotic this is one nation under god

4245088 m s que un intento de evitar la ilegalizaci n era la nica opci n para trabajar en nuestro pueblo y cumplir con nuestro programa
4245089 no fue una estrategia para hacer frente a la ilegalizaci n sino que pensamos que era el modo de responder al mandato que recibimos de los ciudadanos y a los compromisos que tomamos

4245124 i would like to announce today that the victoria police board has accepted the resignation of paul battershill effective immediately as a result of a loss of confidence in his leadership of the victoria police department
4245125 the disciplinary hearing set for aug 18 will no longer proceed due to the resignation of battershill
4245126 the police board will not be paying a severance to battershill we will contribute a sum of 15 000 towards battershills legal fees as part of the settlement agreement the victoria police board considers this matter closed
4245127 a public hearing could be held if the commissioners office believes that the issues are such that they are in the public interest
4245128 the investigation completed by the rcmp did not find that battershill had committed any criminal acts had any involvement with any criminal activity nor did it find any financial impropriety
4245129 we as a police board have acted very appropriately and we are looking after the best interests of the taxpayers
4245130 there are some things within the last nine and a half months that we are unable to disclose only due to the fact that we are bound by the settlement agreement at this time

4245133 saya sering bingung mas mengapa saya sulit mengajak orang membuat blog kenapa sih tak semua orang sudi membuat blog saya jadi mikir sebetulnya apakah kita perlu mempunyai blog apakah setiap orang harus ngeblog
4245134 jangan khawatir mat orang yang belum mengenal blog para pemula memang kerap mengajukan pertanyaan semacam itu sebelum saya menjawab apakah setiap orang harus ngeblog saya mau bertanya dulu apakah sampean punya passion setinggi gunung merapi katakanlah pada sesuatu yang akan membuat sampean begitu bergairah baik dalam keadaan senang maupun susah tanpa mempedulikan apakah minat itu akan mendatangkan keuntungan atau tidak apakah sampean menikmati proses menciptakan sesuatu dan berbagi pengetahuan dengan orang lain lalu apakah sampean menikmati dialog dan diskusi sepenuh hati kalau salah satu atau semua jawabannya ya berarti sampean perlu punya blog sampean berpotensi menjadi blogger yang bagus orang yang tak punya hasrat akan gampang jemu dan ujung ujungnya menelantarkan blognya orang yang tak pernah menikmati proses membuat sesuatu pasti juga tak akan senang mencari ide dan mengisi blog orang yang enggan berdiskusi niscaya bakal menganggap ngeblog itu kegiatan yang membuang buang waktu saja menurut saya blog memang bukan untuk semua orang sampean pun tak perlu ngeblog seandainya memang tak memiliki cukup waktu luang hidup sampean tak mendapat nilai tambah apa pun sulit atau tak nyaman menulis dikejar kejar tugas sehari hari tak suka perubahan atau merasa terancam sewaktu menjalin relasi sosial pendeknya orang tak perlu ngeblog jika ogah berkomunikasi jika sampean ini tukang jahit dengan pesanan yang mengalir deras sampai sampai tak punya cukup waktu istirahat ya ndak usah ngeblog tapi seandainya sampean ini desainer baju dan memerlukan media untuk memajang hasil kreasi barangkali sampean perlu punya blog sampean bisa berkomunikasi dengan pelanggan membuka ruang konsultasi desain dan sebagainya blog itu ruang interaksi antara sampean dan khalayak blog bukan reklame pasif tapi aktif tentu saja blog sampean tak serta merta bakal dikenal orang dan menyedot perhatian publik begitu muncul pertama kali sampean terlebih dulu harus membangun jaringan berpromosi dan sebagainya supaya dikenal
4245135 sampean harus berorientasi pada khalayak menaruh minat dan berada di antara mereka sampean mesti berinteraksi juga secara konsisten melayani dan memperhatikan mereka kalau sampean merasa itu semua berlebihan cari kesibukan lain jangan ngeblog sisi positifnya blog adalah cara terbaik untuk beratraksi mendidik dan berbagi dalam sekejap sampean akan meraih reputasi memperoleh umpan balik dan kesenangan lewat blog tapi sekali lagi pada akhirnya blog memang bukan untuk semua orang mat hidup jalan terus biarpun sampean tak punya blog

4245141 we werent really able to establish flow and coherence and identity
4245142 to be frank im sort of left with a bad taste because we didnt really win a lot
4245143 once you establish yourself as an actual club i think theres not as much wild growth
4245144 but the key is to keep moving forward and reaching new goals and im confident pete and gwiz will do that
4245145 people get used to playing with certain other players on their lines
4245146 when people cant make it to a game because of a film shoot final project etc lines start getting switched and players skate at positions and with players they are not necessarily used to
4245147 pete came to me as a enthusiastic young player whose enthusiasm sometimes got the better of him
4245148 hes grown into the leadership role a bit but i feel he has a little way to go
4245149 more ice time helps us to progress as players and as a team
4245150 we used to be on the ice once maybe twice a week and wed get rusty in our off time this allows us to really hone in on our skills and tune our games to the fullest potential
4245151 as a result though new parents were afraid to put their babies on their bellies at all even when awake
4245152 i see new parents all the time that by four months of age have never put their babies on their bellies because they are afraid the baby is going to suffocate
4245153 as a result weve seen an alarming increase in skull deformation
4245154 if a baby doesnt get early tummy time they dont push up on their elbows they dont get their heads up and looking around and they dont gain strength in their neck and back muscles
4245155 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
4245156 dont be afraid to put your baby on their tummy for short periods of time while they are awake after a nap diaper change or feeding roll the baby on to his or her stomach and encourage the infant to find focus and follow your face or a toy with their eyes looking up

4245169 we wanted a safe cream that we could put the caffeine into
4245170 wed like to understand the mechanism what is most important is to see whether these moisturizing creams are tumorigenic in people
4245171 i dont think that people should be scared because this is a mouse study and we dont know whether or not it applies to humans
4245172 this is a pretty artificial situation with the mouse skin primed by a lot of uv light to develop cancer
4245173 non melanoma skin cancer in man is very very common and is almost 100 per cent curable with an operation usually simpler than a tooth filling

4245176 we were watching the opening ceremony for the 2000 sydney games and i remember thinking one day i want to be part of that

4245178 i was a teenager back then and i finished eighth i am 23 now i have so much more experience under my belt
4245179 but to be honest everyone will be up for it you can never under estimate anybody when you go into a competition ostaphcuk has been putting in some big throws lately but that wont change the way i approach the competition
4245180 you can never plan to make your biggest throw your last throw
4245181 being world champion doesnt mean much at an olympic games

4245190 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
4245191 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
4245192 at least one from each major family in the series
4245193 there are six long months of work in this research
4245194 some will be against this and some will be for it
4245195 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
4245196 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
4245197 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are

4245207 to me what they are saying is there is a protective system built in that doesnt allow us to overuse our muscles
4245208 when you do something repetitive the body knows how to prevent injury

4245470 in considering these prospects it is worth recalling that despite early challenges the 1990s turned out to be an excellent decade for the u s economy by almost all metrics

4245488 the water district and makar are paving the way for development on the gaviota coast lafco is supposed to prevent urban sprawl and protect agriculture but in this case they have done the opposite
4245489 from all indications of the various parties involved youll probably be following this one in the courts
4245490 my understanding is that is the 1998 annexation was recorded the gaviota coast conservancy would sue and it was not recorded lafco would be sued by the property owner
4245491 why its been unrecorded for ten years is difficult to explain
4245492 certainly this raises great concerns to lafcos commitment to preserving the gaviota coast
4245493 it doesnt change the zoning and it doesnt change the property
4245494 it just puts the property within the boundaries of the goleta water district

4245525 we are dealing with radio waves at a high frequency many things could cause these issues
4245526 even peoples sweaty hands could have an effect or how close they hold the device to their heads or in what direction they are pointing the phone

4245581 what is your name how long have you worked here i wish i was in love with you instead of obsessed do you think im dangerous obsession is a dangerous emotion with love there is care and caution with obsession it is just desire i wish we could skip over all the uncomfortablness of a complete stranger wanting to know you just because of how you look to them if there was some way to find out five months from now what wed know about each other then and place it in our heads now i would do it in an instant time means nothing to me i was born a second ago i just died a moment ago here i am born again oh wait you missed it i died again im sorry but youll get no facts about me its unfair but that is all you get two hot eyes cutting into your flesh making you uncomfortable you may wonder why this happened to me how long has this been going on what if i would have just stayed in bed today but this prick has to come accost me oh no bad choice of words that sounds negative when two seemingly infinite beings collide and their streams of consciousness run together they cant have any preconceived positive or negative input but here i am i chose you as ever flowing i cannot change that but you can build trenches dams and waterfalls to change the path so it would seem as i have not really talked to you before that i only have my truth to confiscate so i am lost in it and i cant rise from this stream i do anyway naked and wet grasping on to muddy banks i pry myself out of the swiftly moving current i lay exhausted from the effort on the bank air drying and breathing in the breathing becomes less violent i close my eyes and fall asleep i awake hours maybe years later in a dry desert ocean underneath a starry sky my skin is dry my mouth is parched my lips cracked and bleeding the night shakes her hair and gives me a strange sense of vertigo i walk clumsy and uncertain past desert dunes and sand valleys the night through bleary eyes weeps tears of milky streaks across the sky she combs her hair and ties it back my vision begins to return i take in the scenery and notice pillars and monuments giant altars and stairs that lead to shrines i walk past pyramids and temples rising high to reach for those twinkling lights above i feel that i am not alone weird ugly victims of venemous neglect pour out their pain and whisper in shadows they dance in and out of hiding spots i can almost feel their jelous red eyes glaring at me shuffling my weak body ever forward after miles and endless moonlight plauged by haunts i come upon a cave i press inside amongst reptiles and drawings on the walls forked tongue serpents slide this way and that the drawings are done in white chalk depicting hunters warriors with spears mammoths with wounds running from hoardes of men there are skeletal remains of many victims scattered on the floor that she has lured inside

4245634 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4245635 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
4245636 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale

4245670 you should drink this everyday i hear it retards the ageing process
4245671 my gut feeling is that players will be gearing their game towards the twenty20 format more than the five day format
4245672 the new generation of 15 20 year olds are they going to gear themselves towards travelling the world for nine months of the year playing five day cricket or earn plenty by playing three hour cricket a little bit in india and at home im not too sure
4245673 suppose youre a young player and you suddenly come into the england team now and within the first year you play two stanfords and earn a million quid and get an ipl deal
4245674 wheres it going to go to thats my fear for the longer format that the motivation of players will be more geared towards twenty20 cricket

4245677 we have entered into a one year deal which is by mutual agreement given the blueprint for the new nbl in season 2009 10 and beyond remains to be finalised
4245678 both fox sports and the league see this agreement as a stepping stone to a longer term deal and we are grateful for fox sports continued support of basketball while we undertake the major restructure of the nbl
4245679 given the fact that we are currently undergoing a major review of our entire sport that is expected to see the face of the nbl change considerably in season 2009 10 this is a vote of confidence by fox sports in the future of our sport
4245680 basketball as a sport has made the difficult choice of undergoing some short term pain for the long term benefit of the sport as part of their commercial review and were excited about the future direction that has been mapped out
4245681 with a tighter 10 team competition this season the nbl promises to be a thrilling spectacle in 2008 09 and were pleased to be the official broadcaster of the sport once again

4245687 i think im pretty fine ive had a couple of club games with sydney university and i played a bit of time in the last two tests against the all blacks im ready to go
4245688 as a lineout caller you always take an extra little bit of responsibility and maybe some of the calls i made probably werent up to scratch
4245689 as a collective group we let ourselves down a little bit but theres no need to re invent the wheel we back our system and we back what weve got in place
4245690 theres no need to cry over spilt milk we had a bad night at the office and if that requires the caller to take responsibility then im happy to do that but we will bounce back and we will bounce back well
4245691 i suppose i might get a chance in the future with rocky elsom going overseas
4245692 because i didnt make it then doesnt mean i cant make it in the future i guess ive just got to find out why that is and change it

4245694 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4245695 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4245696 we did not have abou diaby cesc fabregas tomas rosicky samir nasri kolo toure eduardo da silva and philippe senderos while alex song is at the olympics
4245697 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4245698 it isnt that type of occasion i keep saying that i want us to be recognised for the achievements weve had and we deserve to be in the premier league
4245699 im not into the theory of us just going an enjoying the day
4245700 the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4245701 the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal

4245704 i came back last year and played 28 games and scored 10 goals i made an impact and ill do the same again this year whether it means ill play less games or more well see
4245705 no one has worked harder than him to try and get himself right and all he wants to do now is prove to himself and prove to everybody else that has doubted him that he has still got it and that he is still the harry that we used to see lighting up the premiership every week
4245706 i think that he just maybe wanted to get away from england
4245707 maybe i think his reputation had gone before him and he played less than he would like to
4245708 he just saw an opportunity for a fresh challenge but still in champions league football and the opportunity to play regularly and just to focus in a different country where maybe the distraction is less for him
4245709 i hope he does very well im sure with the ability he has he will and if he is playing regularly for galatasaray that means he is going to play well for australia and we are all going to benefit

4245711 a financial settlement is going to be found at the beginning of next week
4245712 i think weve got some time to go before we get to that though i think weve got to stick solid with the sanctity of the contract

4245715 con ud en toda mi carrera es la segunda persona que me pasa
4245716 i trust my directors i believe in the way they work and i let things happen i just try to act in the best way i can
4245717 it is a complicated film you cannot express the film or my character in a few words i play a strange and complex personality
4245718 the film is very costly because of its location the shooting equipment and the international artistes involved kerala is a small place and so it is only once in a blue moon that we can churn out such high budget films
4245719 i dont have a theatre background stage and cinema are two different things i have not done any research or done something extra to play my part i have read the play and i have just enacted it
4245720 the film is called nair san and it is based on a true story of a keralite boy who is settled in japan and is a freedom fighter the director is japanese and his name is albert the shooting of the film has begun the film is partly chinese as we are shooting there as well
4245721 it is how you acclimatise and the language the rest of the things the cameras lights and the way people work are the same your acclimatization and the language are the main things
4245722 i have a couple of offers and that too some irresistible ones but at the moment i have a lot of commitments in the malayalam film industry
4245723 i like to take up only one film at a time i dont like to do other things in between besides bollywood films require a lot of dates and sometimes my dates dont match also i feel one should be very comfortable with the character
4245724 it is an entirely different league a different art it is not an easy thing i will wait it has to happen otherwise i have no plans right now because i will have to stop my acting and then switch over to direction
4245725 i would love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep but everything has to go right
4245726 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision will be made after the 10 000
4245727 i feel fine i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can
4245728 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
4245729 i think we fell into that trap in the last month and it has cost us worrying about opposition teams results
4245730 weve gotten away from our own focus of winning games of football and started looking behind our back a bit
4245731 we looked ahead too and we cant do that any more because theres no bigger game than geelong
4245732 if you start looking ahead against a team like geelong youve got a problem
4245733 last time we played them we stuck with them for three quarters and then gary ablett blew us away in the last quarter
4245734 it does give you confidence to know you can go with them
4245735 last week fremantle was a game where we just wanted to get the win and get our confidence up to give us that momentum going into this week so we could play like we did against geelong earlier in the season
4245736 check the locations of teams the crowd demographics the tv coverage the simplified nature of the game
4245737 i dont think im better than anybody i just know that i try very very hard and its hard for me to have respect for people that dont try for example
4245738 the only thing i really ask of people is that they try they try to be nice to better themselves like my boyfriend right now is 19 he watches all those goofy movies and his goal is to buy a house and restore cars the reason i like him is that he tries i know that anything he goes after he puts his heart into it he looks after people he thinks with his heart
4245739 yeah but that wont be enough in the long run
4245740 i know ive lived abroad for too long ive seen too many things and done too many things to be happy with just a house not work live on his pay check and be loved i need more
4245741 yeah i like it for right now its what i need
4245742 business executives today are telling us that when children graduate from school they need to be educated for the 21st century workforce
4245743 they tell us that they want our children to know how to get along to collaborate to communicate to know content like reading and math to be creative innovative thinkers and to have the confidence to learn from both their successes and their failures
4245744 the children who will be the workforce of the future are in our preschools today
4245745 five cs and that prepare our children for a love of learning
4245746 also is the teacher is engaging and responsive to the children is he or she more likely to ask questions of the children or to just give orders the teacher who asks questions gets children thinking and talking
4245747 you dont want a place that is so quiet and pristine that nobody is talking
4245748 more talk equals more talk and that is true at home as well
4245749 we want our children to be math ready and statistics show that since we have infused our pre schools with some math and reading their skills have increased dramatically but the learning needs to be balanced with social and creative activities that are meaningful and engaging
4245750 when we do too much content we rob pre schoolers from creative innovation
4245751 if all you can do is fill in the blanks youll be a good worker bee but youll never be a boss so we should be looking for pre school where the children learn through play
4245752 parents should look to see if the are there things like blocks finger paints a sand and water table and a dress up corner for children to play with and are they at a reachable level
4245753 every great scientist will tell you that they became great when they learned from their failures
4245754 look to see if the classroom offers the children the opportunity to try things where they might fail like expressing themselves in new ways through painting or singing
4245755 so if i were selecting a pre school id check it against my five cs and if it met those criteria was lively and fun safe and engaging and had an outdoor as well as indoor play space id give it an a and strongly consider it
4245756 the five cs give us signposts and a kind of checklist that can ensure a high quality preschool where children who enjoy the moments of today are also preparing for the world of tomorrow

4245763 talking with forest service firefighters i have been saying this is the sistine chapel the mount sinai the vatican
4245764 if fire should move in naturally were comfortable with that
4245765 but if you bring a drip torch into the vatican and intend to ignite it you are going to have some opposition
4245766 gary and i spent 15 years together building our businesses and he was smart creative and caring
4245767 he will be missed by his family staff clients and of course by me his absence will leave a gaping hole in the music community at large
4245768 and you would ahve if i hadnt blocked you so get over yourself and go away

4245793 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4245794 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4245795 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4245796 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4245797 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4245798 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers

4245805 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person

4245807 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner

4245828 weve got the two tackles price and harwell but were bringing something bruce couldnt bring weve got a lot more strength than he had when he was here though were a little less flamboyant
4245829 we had a lot of injuries last year that left us with a lot of experienced guys who know how to play this season

4245841 they have their passports now they will be leaving for south africa on the 6pm 1600 gmt flight
4245842 we have been trying to tell president mbeki about things like this and people wouldnt believe us but now here it is for all to see
4245843 oh yes of course we got our independence after how many talks hundreds and tens of meetings had been held
4245844 i am there at the talks to protect the will of the people and we are taking a principled stand i maintain a principled stand to defend the will of the people
4245845 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4245846 lets hope the suspicion is unfounded that fascism is resurfacing in our country under another guise
4245847 the only fascism present in italy today are the brutal tones which famiglia cristiana uses
4245848 the nec will have its work cut out for it to have these elections on schedule
4245849 we would have to work with the nec on a number of issues to enable them to have the kind of elections that the sudanese people will find acceptable
4245850 we do not see this as a major problem its just a question of delays
4245851 i am confident that soon these forces will have completely withdrawn from the areas
4245852 can cancel the settlement by breaching their obligation to pay
4245853 one theory is that it has been built to spy on gchq the cheltenham based government listening post because they dont trust the allies but i think that is unlikely
4245854 i know it is there because several people have spoken to me about it and i have also been within 50 yards of it myself source
4245855 shall cause to be published in a widely circulated national business oriented publication or wire service
4245856 i absolutely love it its so gossipy and superficial its amazing
4245857 i probably wouldnt want to see myself on there because it would ruin it for me i like watching other people get gossiped about it makes me feel better
4245858 and half of my friends are guys it can be kind of embarrassing because youre out with a group of friends and the next day it says youre dating one of them and lap dancing too
4245859 where is the buddhist rielle she was a very grounded spiritual beautiful person
4245860 it was a different generation than my own today it would come under the rubric of valley girl talk the use of like instead of to say they were open speaking about sex
4245861 rielle is the black sheep of the family we were all raised the same way she chose a different path
4245862 to clear the space of bad spirits and bring in the good ones but it was meaningful and earnest
4245863 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
4245864 der zweite grundpfeiler einer spirituellen beziehung ist das gemeinsame werk er und sie haben gemeinsame kinder das k nnen reale knuddelige s e nervige kinder sein es k nnen aber auch gemeinsame virtuelle kinder sein wie das schreiben die kunst die kirche der verein und was sonst sein eine partnerschaft hat stets ein gemeinsames kind um das die partner kreisen manche beziehungen zerbrechen wenn die kinder gehen oder wenn die partner nicht mehr gemeinsam ein kind aufziehen wollen
4245865 das bedeutet konkret in einer spirituellen partnerschaft begegnet jeder dem anderen wie in einer werksgemeinschaft mit respekt vor den f higkeiten des anderen mit einem austausch um das kind mit einer erg nzung das werden und wachsen des kindes bestm glich zu unterst tzen wenn wir ltere leute sehen die keine kinder mehr haben dann sollten wir uns alle freuen den von den neuen kindern dieser lteren menschen profitieren wir alle profitiert die gemeinschaft aller menschen
4245866 there are no conditions obviously what is missing is that the waiver is void if there is another atomic test
4245867 i think a majority of countries feel that the current draft is very weak and there is no conditionality at all i dont really think that the us expect that they are able to pass this draft
4245868 we are hopeful the deal will make it to us congress by sept 8
4245869 have taken note of steps that india has taken voluntarily
4245870 the antiwar activists were basically right to protest the war was waged under a false premise and should never have escalated as it did they made their points very rudely though and it would have been nicer if they had been a little more polite and diplomatic and nixon stepped way over the line and deserved to leave office in disgrace
4245871 t here is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america
4245872 should have stayed and won the vietnam war despite the fact that we were losing
4245873 watergate and a lot of things around watergate and vietnam both during the 70s served i think to erode the authority

4245894 are looking forward to the opportunity to defend the charge
4245895 there was no reason to make the community do that
4245896 if and when that happens then we will address it
4245897 but until then i really dont have any other comment on it
4245898 i still have a great passion for the game of football
4245899 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
4245900 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4245901 this is something that we talked about in the early part of the summer we knew that it was just a matter of time before we got it done
4245902 i love being a part of this organization and the direction that the team is heading i am extremely happy to be a part of it moving forward
4245903 i will admit it was quite bizarre to direct my wife in how to make love but its difficult whether youre married to a person or not

4245910 we are working diligently to make university of the west the preeminent location for the academic study of buddhism
4245911 the development of the inter faith master of divinity program at uwest is the product of intense collaboration with hospital based clinical pastoral education programs christian and buddhist denominations and eminent theologians from the united states and abroad
4245912 we are looking forward to a new way of meeting the ministry needs of a new generation
4245913 the significance of wasc approval means other institutions are far more likely to recognized the program and employers as well
4245914 anybody can give out degrees accreditation affirms that our peers in the world of academic learning and professional training have recognized us
4245915 one of the obstacles for buddhists seeking certification as professional chaplains is the lack of accredited graduate training programs
4245916 the program here at uwest is important because it helps to solve this problem and encourage the professional development of buddhist chaplains
4245917 a two year on campus residency requirement is vital for chaplaincy training
4245918 since an indispensible part of being an effective chaplain is good interpersonal skills this residency requirement will allow uwest to evaluate and help students develop these skills

4245925 a grove of trees near ingraham high school received an 11th hour reprieve wednesday when a king county superior court judge ordered a temporary hold on school district plans to fell them
4245926 chief civil judge john erlicks decision wednesday afternoon bars the district from felling the trees until aug 27 at the earliest and gives neighbors a chance to seek a permanent restraining order against removing the trees erlick also ordered the neighborhood group to pay a 7 500 bond to offset damage to the district if its case is found not to have merit
4245927 district officials say they plan to cut 63 trees to make way for an expansion of ingraham high school the district had applied for city permits to build a new wing at the school but has since withdrawn the request the district plans to submit the request after it has felled the trees

4245935 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4245936 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4245937 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4245938 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4245939 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4245940 were discussing what is best for his future whether it is to remain a leaf or move elsewhere

4245949 os n meros hoje vindos a p blico revelam que a economia portuguesa foi capaz de manter o seu n vel de crescimento no segundo trimestre que tinha registado j no primeiro trimestre
4245950 economia portuguesa apresenta um desempenho relativamente melhor face a essa conjuntura adversa face ao acentuado aumento do pre o do petr leo durante o segundo trimestre ao agravamento das taxas de juro e s tens es inflacionistas
4245951 uma redu o das mais significativas dos ltimos anos e que coloca a taxa de desemprego portuguesa numa traject ria de descida
4245952 a economia portuguesa tem vindo a demonstrar uma capacidade de cria o l quida de emprego que n o acontecia h muito no nosso pa s
4245953 positivo mas n o revela capacidade de portugal para fazer face crise que grave
4245954 quase insignificante porque a economia ainda est numa situa o muito fr gil d bil e vulner vel ao que se passa na europa
4245955 a situa o deveras dram tica para ser encarada com j bilo
4245956 tendo em conta que este segundo trimestre naturalmente mais positivo como que portugal vai conseguir o objectivo de 1 5 por cento do pib que o governo fez numa revis o da previs o inicial
4245957 os dados divulgados permitiram concluir que a economia teve uma grande desacelera o e este o ritmo de crescimento mais baixo dos ltimos anos
4245958 nos ltimos anos a taxa tem baixado sempre no segundo trimestre
4245959 o emprego que est a ser criado prec rio e fundamentalmente no sector dos servi os n o no sector produtivo da constru o ou da ind stria
4245960 em euforia com a subida de umas d cimas do pib
4245961 o governo deve manter muita aten o e uma grande preocupa o
4245962 este ciclo econ mico de quase estagna o mostra que o governo tem de ter muita aten o na elabora o do pr ximo or amento de estado
4245963 o decr scimo tem uma marca de precariedade bastante elevada
4245964 obviamente que nos satisfaz que a economia tenha crescido 0 4 por cento e invertido os resultados do primeiro semestre
4245965 confiante que a economia portuguesa possa reagir com as reformas do governo
4245966 a tend ncia nas economias com que nos relacionamos nomeadamente a espanhola de agravamento do desemprego por isso com satisfa o que registamos estas melhorias mostra que as pol ticas econ micas est o a ter sucesso

4245977 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jeter assaulted the guard at the premiers home proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister
4245978 it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4245979 we knew it was just a matter of time before we got it done

4245986 the buildings were designed as a lead actor and a supporting actor
4245987 the intent was that the building would serve as its own sign
4245988 extremely distasteful that an independent public official should feel himself obliged to give way to threats of any sort
4245989 after months of research we have come up with a better way of spreading the nationalist message right across this country
4245990 our very own personal advertising lorry a truth truck brand new and custom built complete with a high definition special lighting system for night time use and a massive audio system for addressing the public can you imagine it
4245991 just imagine how you will feel being part owner of our very own british national party advertising lorry
4245992 surprised myself by not even hesitating to donate 100 towards the campaign
4245993 a few people will be very miffed that it has never been seen by the rank and file
4245994 the failings of the boudica hobby horse should not detract from the ambitions of this new venture
4245995 the most innovative and what will possibly be the most effective campaign in uk pro life history
4245996 enable the pro life message to reach the unreached across the towns and cities of britain these vehicles are wholly owned and operated by lifeleague activists
4245997 these bloody letters are an embarrassment ill not pay another penny so he can go and waste it or lose another blimp
4245998 i cant see any reason why it cant be funded on the national health service if its a case of living or dying the only thing that will help me is the sutent its like manslaughter because if i cant get this i will die
4245999 the decisions nice has to make are some of the hardest in public life nhs resources are not limitless and nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs although these treatments are clinically effective regrettably the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost effective use of nhs resources bevacizumab sorafenib sunitinib or temsirolimus have the potential to extend progression free survival by five to six months but at a cost of 20 000 35 000 per patient per year
4246000 other patients would lose out on treatments that are both clinically and cost effective
4246001 we plough billions into cancer research but the benefits of that research some remarkable drug treatments are not available to all who need them patients are disregarded and given up on because they cannot get the drugs they need
4246002 the possibility that we clinicians may be prevented from offering sutent to our patients is an outrage and a devastating blow to the kidney cancer community
4246003 if this draft guidance is not overturned there will be no point in me accepting referrals of patients with metastatic renal cell cancer as three quarters of patients do not gain any real benefit from interferon leaving only the option of palliative care
4246004 this decision will mean that the uk will have the poorest survival figures for metastatic renal cell cancer in europe sutent produces a remarkable effect on survival for patients it is now no longer ethical or reasonable for patients to have access to treatment with only interferon
4246005 there is a powerful human impulse known as the rule of rescue to attempt to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
4246006 when there are limited resources for healthcare applying the rule of rescue may mean that other people will not be able to have the care or treatment they need
4246007 efficient distribution of resources but sometimes at the expense of fairness it can allow the interests of minorities to be overridden by the majority and it may not help in eradicating health inequalities
4246008 healthcare resources to allow each individual to have a fair share of the opportunities available as far as is possible it allows an adequate but not necessarily maximum level of healthcare but raises questions as to what is fair but an egalitarian approach cannot be fully applied when there are limits on resources
4246009 nhs is funded from general taxation and it is right that uk citizens have the opportunity to be involved in the decisions about how the nhss limited resources should be allocated

4246019 this is not the impeachment of gen musharraf its impeachment of dictatorship that has been ruling the country intermittently for some 31 years out of total 61 years since the country got independence this is the impeachment of a man who worked against the national interests who deepened poverty and unemployment

4246021 most of the effects of low oxygen on fish stocks are what we call sub lethal
4246022 it doesnt kill the fish but stresses them it affects their growth it reduces their reproductive output and makes them more susceptible to disease

4246024 those who do not respect that will lose themselves there will be no change in the will of the iranian people
4246025 the talks in geneva were positive and we believe that a positive direction was found
4246026 we believe it will be reasonable to discuss the common issues in those packages and reach a compromise this could pave the way for resolving the disputed issues
4246027 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short time
4246028 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4246029 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4246030 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4246031 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4246032 the agreement is designed to provide rapid recovery of fair compensation for american nationals with terrorism related claims against libya
4246033 it will also address libyan claims arising from previous u s military actions the agreement is being pursued on a purely humanitarian basis and does not constitute an admission of fault by either party

4246035 the president will neither be impeached nor prosecuted on any charges he will try and stay in pakistan
4246036 the prime minister never offered to absorb 20 000 refugees in israel the prime minister again reiterates that under any future agreement there will not be any return of palestinian refugees to israel in any number
4246037 is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4246038 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4246039 a rather large column of russian armor over 100 pieces
4246040 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4246041 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4246042 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4246043 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4246044 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4246056 while we all agree the protection of hectors and maui dolphins is essential bans in places that dolphins have never been seen only serves to undermine docs credibility
4246057 far too often those really responsible for major habitat destruction and species decline seem to have got away scott free
4246058 doc have found amateur fishers a much easier target when seeking to create marine conservation areas rather than concentrating on destructive bulk harvesting methods or poor land management where the real damage is done
4246059 i get through this easier knowing that god is in control i remind myself of this every day and you should to
4246060 oh please dont lets not if she passes then it is part of gods ultimate plan and we just gotta understand that hes in control now

4246074 if people say my pain is so bad i cant function that is one thing
4246075 if people say i have angina but im doing ok thats another
4246076 pci adds about 10 000 without any significant gain in years of survival or quality of life
4246077 but when a doctor talks to a patient the doctor is an advocate for that patient
4246078 paying the cost out of pocket gives one a different point of view
4246079 until that category is changed the effect of this study will be modest
4246080 we have justified angioplasty for years by saying it is of great benefit to patients
4246081 this study shows no survival benefit and shows that the benefit in regard to symptom relief is temporary medical therapy should be considered for all patients with stable angina unless they have severe pain when diagnosed

4246096 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4246097 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4246098 from here i would like to declare that we have a huge respect for the east and their people

4246102 john mccain cannot make a similar promise for his tax plan
4246103 the average employer contribution to the average family policy is 9 000
4246104 that means that if employers werent providing health benefits the labor market would force them to return that 9 000 to workers
4246105 youre right about this it is only over the long term that the labor market will force employers to increase wages in the short term an employer with some wiggle room could screw its workers over i think that uncertainty will be the biggest political obstacle to mccains tax credit
4246106 when lazarus lay dead in the tomb he could not decide to come to life again in fact lazarus could not even respond to jesus call lazarus come out unless with that call jesus gave him life lazaruss condition as he lay dead in the tomb is a picture of our spiritual predicament we can hear the call of the gospel a hundred times but unless that call is accompanied by the life giving power of the holy spirit we can no more respond to it than lazarus could respond to a vocal call from jesus

4246130 a sign function expression plus content becomes in turn the expression of a further content
4246131 in order to have a connotation that is a second meaning of a sign the whole underlying first sign is required expression plus content
4246132 because the first literal meaning of this word contains semantic markers such as stinky and dirty
4246133 derrida has a distressing penchant for saying things that are obviously false
4246134 derrida has a fascinating penchant for saying things that are nonobviously true or true in a nonobvious way
4246135 when he says that the concept of communication cannot be reduced to the idea of transport of a unified meaning that the notion of literal meaning is problematic that the current concept of context risks being inadequated when he stresses in a text the absence of the sender of the addressee and of the referent and explores all the possibilities of a nonunivocal interpretability of it when he reminds us that every sign can be cited and in so doing can break with every given context engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable in these and many other cases he says things that no semiotician can disregard
4246136 i think rather that derrida takes many of these obvious truths for granted while frequently some of his followers do not

4246148 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4246159 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4246160 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4246161 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4246162 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4246163 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4246164 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4246165 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4246166 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4246201 the report which specifically addressed speculation appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4246202 does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices
4246203 we are greatly disturbed that although cftc staff obviously knew that underlying data used to prepare the interim report was seriously flawed the interim report was nonetheless publicly released
4246204 why it was released after the cftc staff had determined that critical information upon which it was based was inaccurate
4246205 in light of the recent increases in energy prices and the resulting concerns of the public and policy makers
4246206 a year from now we will be talking about how much less share in search they have

4246213 there are deep wrongs in the present constitution of society but they are not wrongs inherent in the constitution of man nor in those social laws which are as truly the laws of the creator as are the laws of the physical universe they are wrongs resulting from bad adjustments which it is within our power to amend
4246214 what does it cost to live here without subsidies or help from relatives with all ones most basic needs met but no frills
4246215 like so many members of the strong silent generation of men who grew up during the great depression and went off to war he had learned long ago that life was hard and nothing was handed to you in fact dad considered it a sign of success and even a blessing that he was able to hold down two jobs he could remember a time when a man considered himself fortunate to have even one
4246216 the earth is thine o lord and all that is contained therein notwithstanding thou hast given the possession thereof to the children of men to pass over the time of their short pilgrimage in this vale of misery we heartily pray thee to send thy holy spirit into the hearts of those that possess the grounds pastures and dwelling places of the earth that they remembering themselves to be thy tenants may not rack or stretch out the rents of their houses or lands not yet take unreasonable fines and incomes after the manner of covetous worldlings but so let them out to others that the inhabitants thereof may be able both to pay their rents and also honestly to live to nourish their family and to relieve the poor give them grace also to consider that they are but strangers and pilgrims in this world having here no dwelling place but seeking one to come that they remembering the short continuance of their lives may be content with what is sufficient and not join house to house nor couple land to land to the impoverishment of others but so behave themselves in letting out their tenements lands and pastures that after this life they may be received into everlasting dwelling places through jesus christ our lord

4246222 there are many people in south africa who are rich and who can share those riches with those not so fortunate who have not been able to conquer poverty
4246223 the christian community cannot and does not want ever to substitute the legitimate and right competencies of institutions
4246224 supporting governments in their work and always proposes cooperating with them for the good of all
4246225 seems to be a secondary or even tertiary concern for many of our elected officials
4246226 not join house to house nor couple land to land to the impoverishment of others
4246227 if you can make it here youll make it anywhere
4246228 why there are recessions and poverty amid plenty and what to do about it solve these problems they are related and we arent going to make a dent in

4246231 the many suffer because they keep alive a social and industrial game that dooms the many to failure and want
4246232 how do we perpetuate the tax industry as it is currently configured
4246233 suppose there should arise from the english channel or the german ocean a no mans land on which common labor to an unlimited amount should be able to make thirty shillings a day and which should remain unappropriated and of free access like the commons which once comprised so large a part of english soil
4246234 here is a little village in ten years it will be a great city in ten years the railroad will have taken the place of the stage coach the electric light of the candle it will abound with all the machinery and improvements that so enormously multiply the effective power of labor
4246235 no the wages of common labor will not be any higher on the contrary all the chances are that they will be lower it will not be easier for the mere laborer to make an independent living the chances are that it will be harder
4246236 rent the value of land go get yourself a piece of ground and hold possession
4246237 middle class u s households with mutual fund investments pension accounts other personal retirement accounts and small personal portfolios
4246238 the free market is the only mechanism that has ever been discovered for achieving participatory democracy
4246239 yes there are taxes i like for example the gasoline tax which pays for highways you have a user tax the property tax is one of the least bad taxes because its levied on something that cannot be produced that part that is levied on the land so some taxes are worse than others but all taxes are bad
4246240 every year that i was in office i knew who my 10 biggest donors were
4246241 the fairness of taxing more lightly income from wages salaries or from investments is beyond question in the first case the income is uncertain and limited in duration sickness or death destroys it and old age diminishes it in the other the source of income continues the income may be disposed of during a mans life and it descends to his heirs surely we can afford to make a distinction between the people whose only capital is their mental and physical energy and the people whose income is derived from investments such a distinction would mean much to millions of american workers and would be an added inspiration to the man who must provide a competence during his few productive years to care for himself and his family when his earnings capacity is at an end
4246242 the fairness of taxing more lightly income from wages or salaries than income from investments
4246243 here is a poor man who has worked hard lived sparingly and invested his savings in a few slaves would you rob him of his earnings by liberating those slaves
4246244 here is a poor widow all her husband has been able to leave her is a few negroes the earnings of his hard toil would you rob the widow and the orphan by freeing these negroes
4246245 progressive income tax is a communist idea it was the second plank of the communist manifesto
4246246 we are so excited to finally get spore into the hands of fans and players
4246247 the maxis studio has had an absolute blast creating spore but the fun is just beginning the most engaging stories are truly the ones people create themselves and we cant wait to see how players not only craft and explore the spore universe but hear what stories they have to tell as a result

4246257 the fighting within our union is weakening us at the bargaining table we obviously need to chart a new course

4246259 we cant make any more music unless we live but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from the black parade when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4246260 growing up i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasise that by doing odd things
4246261 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year

4246265 the price and quantity of residential land in the united states
4246266 the price of residential land in large u s cities
4246267 the big issue is how do you value open space that is being used for a golf course
4246268 interim use of the land until the taxpayers provide the investment in infrastructure which will make the land even more valuable for development than it is as a golf course
4246269 from 1983 to 2004 manufacturers paid more than 618 million in civil penalties most european manufacturers regularly pay cafe civil penalties ranging from less than 1 million to more than 27 million annually asian and us manufacturers have never paid a civil penalty

4246276 hosea lets see thats a part of the old testament isnt it yeah hes one of the prophets but i tried reading it once and i simply couldnt follow the story line when i finished i didnt have a clue where i had been or how i got there so why read it that way since it simply turns out to be a waste of time
4246277 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
4246278 fit into the whole what possibly do you mean by that
4246279 oh they said those are the opening words in lincolns gettysburg address and the lecturer was not talking about something that happened 87 years ago but was alluding to lincolns address and its significance for the point he wanted to make
4246280 a chapter a day looking for a verse for the day
4246281 and they will no longer be plundered i will place over them one shepherd my servant david and he will tend them he will tend them and be their shepherd
4246282 the boy samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the lord and with people

4246284 i will be his father and he will be my son and your house and kingdom shall endure for ever before me your throne will be established forever
4246285 yes of course because they knew their bibles infinitely better than you and i do
4246286 now that joe lieberman is no longer a democrat obama cant pick anyone in the democratic party worse than evan bayh
4246287 our teachers and our students take a lot of pride in doing well
4246288 we of course revel in our friendly rivalry next week they could very well beat us in something
4246289 we have focused the last few years on critical reading and persuasive writing our students and our teachers work so very hard
4246290 you have to continue to work hard if you want to stay on top
4246291 everyone is pushing everyone gwinnett is a great place to educate your child
4246292 the graduating class of 2008 demonstrated a higher level of performance in all areas of the test
4246293 he makes me feel comfortable when hes in front of me
4246294 im definitely going to say this john conner is one of the best fullbacks in the nation
4246295 hes proved it in games in practice everything i feel very comfortable running behind him i feel like im not going to get touched
4246296 youre playing for your teammates and contributing to winning a game
4246297 he can run it and hes one of the best receivers on the team everybody loves john his attitude is great he brings it on the field but hes a nice guy off the field
4246298 it was a struggle coming in as a walk on because youve got to prove yourself
4246299 i just tried to work my way up the ladder and earn respect from the team coming from high school i got the ball a lot more but since ive gotten here and played fullback ive gotten used to it i wouldnt have a problem with more carries but i just want to do my job and do whatever i can to help my team
4246300 hes a very humble guy and doesnt say much he just gets his work done and goes on to the next play
4246301 ive had a headache all camp from going up against john conner
4246302 hes the best fullback ive ever gone up against hes got good technique he stays low hes strong
4246303 this is one of the best looking tbs games ive seen in a long time and it follows in the same spirit of games like heroes of might and magic master of magic and warlords battlecry
4246304 the developers have really taken care to provide extensive depth and content which could make this game one of those that stays sic on gamers sic hard drives for a long time
4246305 weve been continuing to stay at a pretty consistent pace over the past five years
4246306 we believe that missile defense is a susbstantial contribution to natos collective security
4246307 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4246308 this is a step toward real security for poland in the future
4246309 i believe that residents deserve an elected officials undivided attention and due to greater responsibilities at work and increased travel commitments i can no longer give the position the time and energy required
4246310 his measured judgment on issues from the audit committee to finance to zoning meant he was well respected among his colleagues
4246311 we appreciate his service to this community he will be missed
4246312 the website is intended to be a resource for luxury minded travelers seeking information on quality costa rica tours and activities as well as first class jaco beachfront accommodation
4246313 the fact remains that there are iphone 3g customers in the netherlands and in other countries who believe that the user experience on this device is not enough
4246314 here in switzerland we have very mature 3g networks with excellent coverage yet side by side in the same office on the same network the iphone 3g has no 3g service while all other 3g phones have maximum signal and happily place and receive calls and dont drop any
4246315 it could be the chipset it could be how theyve implemented it there could be a lot of things
4246316 phone code is probably the most difficult to do per line of code of any code that i can think of almost everybody who has built an operating system for mobile phones it has taken them a number of years to mature it its just a process everybody has to go through
4246317 in terms of radio reception ive noticed that the iphone 3g will take longer than normal time to re associate itself and in some cases where i know theres a signal it just wont find it in some cases it has weaker reception than with other phones
4246318 especially if their hangout of choice is a gay bar
4246319 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
4246320 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
4246321 now that we have left universal we can really be ourselves and i think that comes across in the new album
4246322 before we were tied down and everything was a bit hectic with deadlines that needed to be met
4246323 every little thing we did was analysed and if we wanted to change a line in a song then a meeting was arranged and everyone argued
4246324 but now that we are on our own things are much different we went to australia and took our time over the new things we have worked really hard and i am extremely proud of the album we have produced
4246325 we have done some good stuff before and created some catchy pop tunes but this is out best material yet and we will be playing our new stuff in carlisle
4246326 i know what it is like to be a fan meeting your heroes when i met green day it was amazing and really made my whole year
4246327 that is why i love meeting the fans because we have all been in their shoes
4246328 i dont always remember people and faces i have seen but when we say hello shake hands or sign an autograph or two the fans remember us and really appreciate it
4246329 do ya is just a great pop track and that is what we try to produce we want to produce ballsy rock pop tracks that will get people singing
4246330 we are looking forward to the festival because playing live is the reason we are in the industry we are
4246331 it is great because we all live next door to each other so when we are not working we hang out together
4246332 we have a lot of fun off set and writing tracks together the boring part comes when we have to promote our album or whatever but you know that once the promotion is done then we are back on the road
4246333 playing at gigs and festivals cannot be beaten and we cant wait to be at carlisle live and then kick off our tour
4246334 over het spel ben ik tevreden over het resultaat een beetje minder
4246335 alles wat we voorzien hadden is gebeurd we hebben ruimte gevonden om te voetballen
4246336 over het spel ben ik tevreden over het resultaat een beetje minder als je zon wedstrijd speelt moet je 1 0 of 2 0 of 3 1 winnen
4246337 alhoewel het heel moeilijk was hebben we op stilstaande fasen niets wegegeven
4246338 ik vind dat wij vooruitgang geboekt hebben al moeten we wel beter afwerken
4246339 duarte op rechts was een noodoplossing zijn beste plaats is centraal we moeten het doen met de middelen die we hebben
4246340 we hebben tegen die grote mannen goed de lange bal eruit gehouden soms waren er positioneel wat fouten achterin maar gelukkig konden ze niet scoren
4246341 wij hadden wat pech bij de afwerking al deed azofeifa het wel schitterend
4246342 bij die gelijkmaker veranderden ze van systeem ineens speelden ze met vier aanvallers en dat zorgde even voor verwarring
4246343 er kwamen veel lopende mensen en zo konden ze spijtig genoeg een gaatje vinden
4246344 not all hemangiomas need treatment actually the majority does not but a significant minority does
4246345 so the real message of our study is that patients with hemangiomas that are at high risk for complication or need treatment should be identified early and referred as soon as possible
4246346 one major reason for this is that current treatments work best when instituted early
4246347 by 5 months of age the majority of growth is actually over and the opportunity to prevent complications in many cases has already passed
4246348 if ginnys not laying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then im a flobberworm
4246349 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i am convicted in advance
4246350 highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
4246351 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammad as a hostage i have no problem with islam but with the terrorists
4246352 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologise we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark i cant apologise i respect islam and i did not target it
4246353 blaspheming the prophet mohammed and islam as well as sowing religious and sectarian discord
4246354 we welcome his reasonable approach but in our opinion this person has committed a crime and should be punished
4246355 our analysis shows that smaller agencies with a high proportion female staff such as the defence housing authority or the human rights and equal opportunity commission tend to have lesser pay outcomes
4246356 the price of the ps3 is high but youre paying for potential
4246357 the ten year strategy is ingrained in all of us jack tretton has brought that to all levels of the organization
4246358 we experienced a strong second quarter due to solid execution in our online gaming and advertising businesses
4246359 we remain conservative in our sales expectations for the fall season and will manage our business accordingly
4246360 we are well positioned to chase business should the environment improve
4246361 all these so called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategy where they must stay
4246362 rumsfelds dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of american servicemen and women
4246363 responsible for america and her allies going to war with the wrong plan
4246364 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
4246365 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
4246366 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
4246367 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war
4246368 no other human activity gives it greater scope no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder
4246369 it is not possible that this child could be mine
4246370 the body does not lie the face does not lie and the voice does not lie
4246371 the fate of yahoo is not going to change by any addition of these board members
4246372 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a six year old to hear
4246373 its about allowing your neighbours to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4246374 at first glance its hard to imagine two more biologically distinct groups of people burying their dead in the same place
4246375 the biggest mystery is how they seemed to have done this without disturbing a single grave
4246376 nei alts hun gjorde alle disse rare heltegreiene fordi hun ikke hadde funnet den rette mannen
4246377 jeg bare henger rundt her og venter p at mannen min skal komme tilbake
4246378 membership websites are informational hubs that provide specialized knowledge in a well packaged form
4246379 it amounts to a declaration of war on two income families a marriage penalty of punitive proportions
4246380 na jesse owens paavo nurmi en carl lewis is er nu phelps en dat hebben we nodig
4246381 survivior havent we gone about 15 seasons too long gabon
4246382 shell also talk about issues that are pertinent to them from her position on the armed services committee
4246383 its one of the reasons why we made some of the choices we made like when we pulled out the potion system
4246384 when we wanted to add a hot bar we knew we had to pull the potion stuff out every time we add something we have to pull something out to keep the game very simple and straightforward to play
4246385 if shoaib choudhury was in europe during the shoah he would have refused to drive the trains
4246386 made offensive comments on the muslim world islam and muslims in bangladesh and commented about the existence of al qaeda and other islamist militant groups by which you have tarnished the image of bangladesh in the outside world
4246387 look everyone is going to die the only issue is what you do while you are alive
4246388 instead of enforcing the law you are becoming a criminal police force
4246389 you should have been fighting for the jews right to reach their lands and instead you are a criminal police force
4246390 they help the arab criminals who build on jewish land in jerusalem and instead of destroying the illegal arab houses they prevent the owner of the land in jerusalem from going into the land
4246391 what were seeing here is the second division of jerusalem once they divide jerusalem with the separation fence and now even what is inside the so called jewish part of jerusalem is being divided by declaring that there are places here to which jews have no access
4246392 in a lot of the plots i find arabs are living and building illegally and also working the jnf land without permission
4246393 during the years of the intifada the municipality had difficulty carrying out the necessary level of enforcement in the neighborhoods of eastern jerusalem due to security constraints
4246394 whoever thinks its possible to live with 270 000 arabs in eastern jerusalem must take into account that there will be more bulldozers more tractors and more cars carrying out terror attacks
4246395 whoever thinks the problem of jerusalem and terror are specific and that destroying one house or another will help is burying his head in the sand the main question is does the government want jerusalem arab neighborhoods of jebl mukaber or sur bahir as part of israel or not
4246396 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4246397 this can be important as a model for a religious leader who is bipartisan in reaching out to find out about candidates
4246398 hes putting himself on center stage at a critical moment with a tremendous amount of responsibility riding on his shoulders
4246399 draga dumnezeule daca esti atent duminica in biserica iti arat pantofii mei cei noi
4246400 dumnezeu vreau sa traiesc 900 de ani ca tipul acela din biblie

4246409 cat timp am fost in vacanta tot timpul a plouat si taticul a fost tare nervos si a spus niste lucruri despre tine dar te rog sa nu i faci rau
4246410 te rog sa mi trimiti un ponei pana acum nu ti am cerut nimic poti verifica

4246429 revolutionary road is so painful and beautiful to read simply because of the brutality of the honesty that frank and april end up experiencing together

4246436 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4246437 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4246438 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4246439 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue
4246440 we know that greek drama was theater for combat veterans by combat veterans

4246443 when it was motionless it was actually towed to the bay
4246444 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre
4246445 its not in the same context as the hole in the aeroplane or the grounding of the aircraft
4246446 the world is a book those who dont travel read only a page
4246447 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4246448 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4246449 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4246450 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4246451 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue

4246455 violence including sexual vio lence remains an everyday threat for women and girls
4246456 most of women and girls were raped by family members and friends
4246457 the question is why does thai society still ignore violence against women the ignorance about vio lence against women in society is a kind of violence itself
4246458 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board

4246462 theres no such thing as objectivity ultimately everything is subjective

4246513 it is out of the question that the country would satisfy its domestic demands by increasing tree felling from neighboring countries
4246514 why should we wait for britain or anyone else to get here
4246515 africa is a good environment for us to invest in because theres too much competition in europe and america
4246516 we like chinese investment because we have one meeting we discuss what they want to do and then they just do it
4246517 there are no benchmarks and preconditions no environmental impact assessment if a g8 country had offered to rebuild the stadium wed still be having meetings about it
4246518 weve spent 15 years working on conventions against corruption and now the chinese come in and they havent signed up to any of it
4246519 theyre secretive and they only deal with governments they dont consult civil society or anyone im worried that african governments will see china as an alternative to g8 countries because with the chinese they dont have to worry about good governance and all that
4246520 i think the internal situation in the sudan is an internal affair and we are not in a position to impose upon them
4246521 you have tried to impose a market economy and multiparty democracy on these countries which are not ready for it we are also against embargoes which you have tried to use against us
4246522 they dont have anything to do with politics or problems things move smoothly successfully
4246523 we are looking to the east where the sun rises and have turned our backs on the west where the sun sets
4246524 but its wide awake its the elephant creeping up behind us only its so big we can scarcely see it moving
4246525 we are dedicated to non interference and social development of african countries
4246526 sometimes african countries will be in extremely difficult political situations
4246527 increasing hostility we think that when youre dealing with a failing state or a sensitive state other methods than those used by western people will be more productive
4246528 since the 1980s theres been a switch from one way aid loans from china to africa to cooperation that is beneficial to both partners
4246529 chinese aid is not supposed to be like these alms coming to the poor but is supposed to be something of mutual benefit and theyre very frank about that its also got no conditions this is controversial its supposed to have quick results this is why they use a lot of chinese labor in africa
4246530 the first is no political strings attached and the second is we try to do the utmost within our capacity to help africa we fully respect the wills of the african countries each time we implement the projects through friendly negotiations
4246531 what happens is that the chinese aid teams that constructed the stadiums and other things stay behind and they retain their equipment so they are well positioned to start bidding on government contracts
4246532 we take advantage of our low cost cheap materials technology and cheap labor to maximize our efficiency of aid to africa
4246533 some people are curious some people are interested some people have prejudices and some people fear for their domination in this regard and they fear that the alternative constitutes competition
4246534 misses the point because its not only westerners who are raising concerns its more and more africans themselves
4246535 some of these less rational critiques have the effect of sort of driving africans into chinas arms the attitude in africa is if the west is against it then there must be something good in it
4246536 im hearing bad reports from my african sisters and brothers that the chinese are stealing from them the chinese are fighting them from getting their own fish out of the water they africans have to import fish from the us of a because they have to fight the chinese to get the fish out of their own waters
4246537 sovereign state and we have legitimate national interests for development when we pursue business in africa its to maximize benefits on both sides
4246538 what we engage with africa is indeed a win win policy and its a win win model and we do not want to do anything detrimental to africans interest that is why china is so popular on the african continent nowadays
4246539 in southern africa you have a kind of explosive mix of powerful trade union movements particularly in south africa and to some extent in zambia there are perceptions that chinese companies have poor labor and environmental policies it china has significant investments in dangerous sectors like mining and a substantial amount of chinese aid you have the potential for a very explosive situation
4246540 africa is just interested in business were not interested in anything else what africans want is business and development we want a better life so we just want to find out where can we get more chinese businesses
4246541 the word china does not evoke darfur or zimbabwe the first thing that comes to mind for nigerian businesspeople when you mention china is business the see china as a source of cheap consumer goods of cheap and cost effective manufacturing technology of cheap and cost effective expatriate technicians
4246542 things have been said like the chinese will listen to africas will and promote socioeconomic development well my take on that is that actually theres a contradiction there because when we talk about state to state relationships particularly in africa china is not listening to the african peoples wills china is listening to african elites wills their interests and inclinations are extremely different to what the ordinary citizens might be
4246543 simply acting in a pragmatic and self interested manner and following its own understanding of particular concepts such as human rights sovereignty and non interference the problem is not necessarily beijing but is to be found in the nature of many african nations
4246544 if chinas leaders are genuine in their belief that chinese engagement with africa will not repeat the crimes of european colonizers then engaging without damaging remains the fundamental challenge to chinas africa policies
4246545 strengthening democracy to strengthening rule of law and practicing good governance
4246546 force any political systems on africa as a precondition for our aid
4246547 illegitimate states whose policies promote instability economic underdevelopment and political autocracy
4246548 at the moment it appears that china is actively undermining human security in africa either deliberately in cases like sudan or by default but im very hopeful that chinas policies towards africa are evolving and maturing and that well see positive developments in the future
4246549 no panacea for africa chinas influence is not an alternative to neo liberalism
4246550 chinas footprint in africa becomes more pronounced each time the continent receives another high level chinese delegation
4246551 the u s will talk to you about governance efficiency about security about the environment the chinese just ask how do we procure this license
4246552 business is business we try to separate politics from business secondly i think the internal situation in the sudan is an internal affair and we are not in a position to impose upon them
4246553 is chinas approach the answer to africas problems or is it just a replay of africas colonial mercantilistic relationship with europe
4246554 china is both a tantalizing opportunity and a terrifying threat

4246560 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4246561 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change

4246581 according to italian law the demand to remove a name from the register must be made by an individual with a personal interest rather than by a private association such as the uaar

4246650 impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4246651 the cocktail to blame is the super dry vodka martini
4246652 almost 75 percent of my vodka martini drinkers are very very afraid of vermouth
4246653 they dont even know what it tastes like but a friend who gave them their first dirty martini didnt use it so they dont want it in there
4246654 by the 1890s its like every drink has vermouth in it
4246655 people dont like it nobody drinks it straight and its used in a few cocktails the most important of which is the martini and when making martinis people dont use it
4246656 youd smell it and imagine yourself being transported to a mountain meadow
4246657 my objective from the very beginning was to make something that people would enjoy drinking straight
4246658 we continue to try to get people to think of it on its own but so far that doesnt seem to be happening
4246659 this is going to sound totally dorky but i did a vermouth intensity chart where i rate them from the most to least intense
4246660 that boldness when youre using half an ounce in a cocktail it showcases your vermouth rather than losing it
4246661 when i try to use the carpano antica or the vya i really have to think whats going on here
4246662 the carpano antica is a linebacker and the cinzano is a soccer player theyre both muscular but one lets you know when it hits you
4246663 theres so much flavor going on in the antica and even the texture it makes its presence known if youre using it you need to have something big strong and bold enough to go up against it or youre going to have to really cut back in its proportions
4246664 in that case you want a strong bourbon and a strong vermouth that can help tame down the absinthe
4246665 i think vermouths most important attribute is its alcohol content
4246666 its not much more than wine and it helps tone down big gnarly spirits like whiskey and gin even tequila
4246667 martini amp rossi is the only vermouth for a negroni period
4246668 its the only one that can handle the campari on a 1 to 1 ratio the sugar levels just arent there in the more esoteric vermouths so martini amp rossi is what i use for that one and i serve a hell of a lot of negronis
4246669 since the wine was getting a little old i wasnt going to crush anything by adding botanicals to it
4246670 there was no delicate balance i was going to screw up
4246671 i have three guests who drink this exclusively before dinner ive actually set bottles aside for them because i know ill run out by the end of the summer
4246672 youll make a drink that seems like its missing something and its a running joke that you just add sweet vermouth to it
4246673 i always order a wet martini when i go out these days
4246674 people used to look at me like i was insane but now theyve clearly heard of it
4246675 people have an aversion to vermouth and quite frankly its well founded
4246676 even if you keep your vermouth in the fridge after a week youll notice it has a different flavor if you keep that vermouth on a shelf its going to taste terrible thats why people dont like vermouth
4246677 in the past everything was grown together and we often didnt even know what grapes were going into the blend
4246678 today its important to communicate that we dont only have one wine
4246679 its true that the overall alcohol levels in vinho verde are increasing
4246680 not only is there the influence of global warming but the vineyards are now planted more properly with the right varieties and were seeing more work and care in the vines
4246681 with the new systems of viticulture we can get higher levels of alcohol and more ripeness but we still try to preserve the classic style
4246682 loureiro is best near the atlantic where its light fresh and very aromatic
4246683 azal gives citrusy aromas while arinto usually has green apple flavors with good structure and richness
4246684 alvarinho needs at least six or seven months in the bottle and preferably even one year
4246685 are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee

4246687 this is a huge win for humpback whales and all those who have worked for more than four decades to protect them

4246691 the bta has been teaching cycling courses to adults youth and families for over a decade
4246692 as more portlanders walk bike and take transit there is a growing need to remind all road users of their responsibilities the eye to eye campaign is an excellent addition to portlands share the road efforts this statewide campaign is an important component of our efforts to continue reducing injuries it also supports increasing the percentage of oregonians especially seniors and children that are able to walk and bike due to improved safety
4246693 as the director of portlands office of transportation i am involved in daily discussions about how to best allocate limited funding to operate and maintain portlands roads and bridges education efforts like the eye to eye campaign are cost effective ways for us to ensure that our transportation system is operating safely and efficiently for all road users
4246694 with more than 500 buses on the road at rush hour along many bike routes trimet knows the importance of making eye to eye contact with bicyclists we are very happy to be partners with bta in this important campaign to help keep everyone safe
4246695 odots mission has always been safety first whether by bus train two wheels or four the eye to eye campaign reminds us all to educate ourselves and respect one another because we all want to make it home safely
4246696 as co creator sponsor and teacher involved in the monthly
4246697 the oregon trucking association ota has been serving the needs of the states trucking industry for more than 50 years ota is committed to transportation safety for all modes we regularly provide safety trainings and information to oregon truckers including the latest research and resources related to truck safety we encourage our members to practice proper truck maintenance and operation to remain alert and aware at all times and to maintain a proper distance from other vehicles and road users it is helpful for everyone to remember that larger vehicles including trucks suvs motor homes and other oversized vehicles frequently have blind spots that prevent truck and vehicle drivers from seeing bicyclists pedestrians and other smaller roadway uses increased awareness and an understanding of our physical limitations will allow everyone to see eye to eye to ensure safety on our roadways
4246698 con way applauds the btas efforts to promote safety among road users through its eye to eye campaign
4246699 as an employer of both professional drivers and staff who bike to our portland administrative offices nearly 10 percent of our workforce to date we have a vested interest in creating an environment that is safe and enjoyable for everyone who shares the road eye to eye is a program that can benefit us all
4246700 instructed students that divine providence is the source of all of history
4246701 the situation here on ground is that essential commodities have started getting dried up diesel is already out of stock and petrol at its verge of end the people here are very much concerned as if the same continues for next few days there will be nothing left to eat with the people of kashmir and on the other side the army is supporting the mobs who have allegedly beaten up the drivers stranded on the national highway the drivers who were beaten up reported that they asked army to help them but all went in despair and the army people in return handed them over to the mobs the target is only the kashmiri muslims and some sources from jammu say that it is the outsiders who have come to jammu and are doing such attacks on the muslims and it is quite evident that the hindu fundamentalist groups viz bjp rss vhp etc are all sponsoring the planned attacks onto the kashmiris like it was done in gujarat here in kashmir we feel the history seems to be being repeated by the hindu fundamentalists who had earlier in 1947 killed about 250 000 muslims in jammu

4246712 hosea lets see thats a part of the old testament isnt it yeah hes one of the prophets but i tried reading it once and i simply couldnt follow the story line when i finished i didnt have a clue where i had been or how i got there so why read it that way since it simply turns out to be a waste of time
4246713 for me to live is christ and to die is gain
4246714 fit into the whole what possibly do you mean by that
4246715 oh they said those are the opening words in lincolns gettysburg address and the lecturer was not talking about something that happened 87 years ago but was alluding to lincolns address and its significance for the point he wanted to make
4246716 a chapter a day looking for a verse for the day
4246717 and they will no longer be plundered i will place over them one shepherd my servant david and he will tend them he will tend them and be their shepherd
4246718 the boy samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the lord and with people

4246720 i will be his father and he will be my son and your house and kingdom shall endure for ever before me your throne will be established forever
4246721 yes of course because they knew their bibles infinitely better than you and i do
4246722 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4246723 what does sissy mean hmm yeah you heard that word in that william book huh yeah well pauses it means more pauses well
4246724 there are seven sins in the world wealth without work pleasure without conscience knowledge without character commerce without morality science without humanity worship without sacrifice and politics without principle
4246725 the weak can never forgive forgiveness is the attribute of the strong
4246726 an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
4246727 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4246728 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4246729 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4246730 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4246731 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4246732 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4246733 the optimal position for wearing a backpack is high on the upper back with straps over both shoulders
4246734 kids who wear their backpacks in the more stylish lower back position or only use one strap may suffer shoulder pain and posture problems
4246735 whats interesting here is that contrary to popular belief its not just the weight of the backpack but how its carried
4246736 and the pain generated is not just on the back it includes the pressure on the skin which causes nerve pain similar to that tingling sensation caused when a leg or arm falls asleep
4246737 its possible that our subjects alter their posture by elevating the right shoulder thus increasing the contact pressure on that shoulder
4246738 if those postures are practiced over a long period of time with more weight and pressure on one shoulder it may alter posture and produce prolonged pain we need to study this further
4246739 following these recommendations may require conscious effort from the kids encouragement from parents peers and school staff until it becomes habitual
4246740 although professionals and parents cannot often dictate what children should carry it is important for us to educate them so they carry the packs correctly
4246741 parents also need to check what their children are carrying we found that quite often its not just books and school work thats weighing them down but ipods and laptop computers and other things they may not need to carry to school everyday
4246742 business executives today are telling us that when children graduate from school they need to be educated for the 21st century workforce
4246743 they tell us that they want our children to know how to get along to collaborate to communicate to know content like reading and math to be creative innovative thinkers and to have the confidence to learn from both their successes and their failures
4246744 the children who will be the workforce of the future are in our preschools today
4246745 five cs and that prepare our children for a love of learning
4246746 also is the teacher is engaging and responsive to the children is he or she more likely to ask questions of the children or to just give orders the teacher who asks questions gets children thinking and talking
4246747 you dont want a place that is so quiet and pristine that nobody is talking
4246748 more talk equals more talk and that is true at home as well
4246749 we want our children to be math ready and statistics show that since we have infused our pre schools with some math and reading their skills have increased dramatically but the learning needs to be balanced with social and creative activities that are meaningful and engaging
4246750 when we do too much content we rob pre schoolers from creative innovation
4246751 if all you can do is fill in the blanks youll be a good worker bee but youll never be a boss so we should be looking for pre school where the children learn through play
4246752 parents should look to see if the are there things like blocks finger paints a sand and water table and a dress up corner for children to play with and are they at a reachable level
4246753 every great scientist will tell you that they became great when they learned from their failures
4246754 look to see if the classroom offers the children the opportunity to try things where they might fail like expressing themselves in new ways through painting or singing
4246755 so if i were selecting a pre school id check it against my five cs and if it met those criteria was lively and fun safe and engaging and had an outdoor as well as indoor play space id give it an a and strongly consider it
4246756 the five cs give us signposts and a kind of checklist that can ensure a high quality preschool where children who enjoy the moments of today are also preparing for the world of tomorrow
4246757 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4246758 within the conventional definition of race white black asian minority versus non minority this is a big change
4246759 one reason i refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that i think it glorifies and thus encourages the wrong behavior it makes heroes out of security people as if the people who dont just fix normal bugs arent as important in fact all the boring normal bugs are way more important just because theres a lot more of them
4246760 i think the openbsd crowd is a bunch of masturbating monkeys in that they make such a big deal about concentrating on security to the point where they pretty much admit that nothing else matters to them
4246761 revels in exposing vendor security holes because they see that as just another proof that the vendors are corrupt and crap which admittedly mostly are
4246762 both camps are whoring themselves out for their own reasons and both camps point fingers at each other as a way to cement their own reason for existence
4246763 you need to fix things early and that requires a certain level of disclosure for the developers
4246764 you also dont need to make a big production out of it
4246765 what does the whole security labeling give you except for more fodder for either of the pr camps that i obviously think are both idiots pushing for their own agenda
4246766 any situation that allows the vendor to sit on the bug for weeks or months is unacceptable as is any situation that makes it harder for people who find problems to talk to technical people
4246767 so the whole embargoes are good mentality is just corruption from the vendors
4246768 but on the other hand disclosure should not be the goal
4246769 have a model where security is easier to do in the first place that is the unix model but make it easy for people to report bugs with no embargo but privately
4246770 even then i will forward it to technical people on an as needed basis because even that embargo secrecy is not some insane absolute thing
4246771 no other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change
4246772 within the conventional definition of race white black asian minority versus non minority this is a big change
4246773 i missed you i like it when you pay attention to me with the implication of taking care of him and paying attention to his shit aida the petit prince
4246774 yeah yeah but im a girl i swear im a girl
4246775 the fate of yahoo is not going to change by any addition of these board members
4246776 the evidence presented at both the hearing on the motion to suppress and during the trial on the merits was overwhelming that the accused was suffering on the day in question from extreme emotional distress and was incapable of forming the requisite mens rea guilty mental state
4246777 im extremely pleased that jim was found not guilty his life is back on track and i am happy for him
4246778 finalmente conseguimos que se entendiese nuestro punto de vista que polonia que es un socio crucial en la otan y un importante amigo y aliado de estados unidos tambi n debe estar seguro
4246779 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4246780 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4246781 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region

4246784 persimmon is an adventure and the bumpiness of the trip including spasmodic and sometimes confused service is in large part redeemed by the price
4246785 the menu sprawls to more than 100 selections its too much but then at this genre of restaurant its always too much
4246786 more than a decade and a half since it opened oceana presses on still proud still vital still very much worth boarding
4246787 dont get me wrong benoit isnt a bad restaurant nor is it a throwaway restaurant not even close it has many enviable pleasurable virtues
4246788 with stool seating a focus on small plates under 10 and lengthy selections of wines by the glass terroir and gottino are better described as wine bars though
4246789 bar q is more than flesh and bones and only obliquely related to the explosion of barbecue joints around the city its a laboratory in which ms lo can root
4246790 the ostensibly individual tables bisecting the dining room are essentially one way too long communal table which makes for odd traffic patterns
4246791 the harrison is the very definition of dependable poised to impress you if not quite wow you with a hefty juicy english cut lamb chop that might well be the
4246792 the menu had just been revised to reflect the advance of spring and i had a green green meal a silky bright tasting soup of fava beans and early peas an expertly prepared risotto with more peas ramps and like a bright white archipelago on an emerald sea dabs of house made ricotta
4246793 ko doesnt come easy and thats a big part of why it is and will no doubt remain the most talked about new restaurant this year but its noteworthy beyond its
4246794 commerce in one sense evokes the waverly inn and in another emulates balthazar but in the end it isnt like either of them which becomes clear when the menu arrives and in its wake the food
4246795 we are routinely bringing in approximately a quarter million dollars per month

4246804 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
4246805 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
4246806 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50m and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
4246807 we are working with the uk bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
4246808 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
4246809 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
4246810 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk

4246821 the pulse would show that in the past six months this user has been upset and now it looks like something happened
4246822 if you are extremely angry i can see it in real time
4246823 and you can make that person even more upset by leaving a comment on their blog that says i agree with you and i understand because that person pissed me off too leading you to think about it more
4246824 im just trying to show a proof of concept that this can be done
4246825 if you just take what were presenting it doesnt seem like you could get a real understanding of whats going through a users brain
4246826 the message we do not want to send is dont use these social networking apps

4246965 see now why do people post up stupid pictures like this
4246966 life comes at you fast slow down and enjoy it
4246967 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4246968 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4246969 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf
4246970 the vermont college writers community is so caring and the faculty amazing you cant help but dig in
4246971 do multiroom systems just do mp3s what about my cds
4246972 im retired from politics so when i attend i dont get stirred up i dont get the buzz i dont feel quite the excitement i used to i pay close attention and see a lot of old friends i find it quite exhausting whereas years ago i would have fed on it
4246973 the first time the excitement might carry you but im telling you it can be really hot slow chaotic its a tough grind unless youre a delegate in a first class hotel room and you dont have to travel very far its rough
4246974 its not nostalgia its a bit disorienting i may not even stay the whole week id like to see obama give his speech on television
4246975 our friends at thermaltake thought this an excellent idea and immediately jumped onboard to develop esa compatible cases power supplies and watercooling systems i wont go any deeper into esa at this time as this case is merely the first installment in a series of esa reviews following the armor esa case will be an esa supporting thermaltake bigwater watercooling system next a thermaltake esa compatible power supply and finally a full blown article on esa itself so in this review i will concentrate on the armor and save the esa specifics for a later date will the case meet the standards t hat we have come to expect from thermaltake read on to find out
4246976 like the gtx 280 which has dropped in price over the last few weeks the gtx 260 has followed suit whether youre a fan of ati or not the release of the hd 4800 series and their performance to price ratio has forced nvidia to cut margins on the new gtx line up of cards and give us an extremely powerful card for what now resembles a fair price to date weve only had a look at one gtx 260 which came with a massive out of the box overclock what this means is it hasnt really given us the ability to completely come to terms with what the gtx 260 offers in its cheapest form the stock form
4246977 today we are looking at the latest version of nuances dictation software called dragon naturallyspeaking 10 if you are looking to get your work done faster with less typing this application is worth a look i admit im not totally ready to give up my keyboard for some applications like the content management systems on our website voice commands dont work well another issue for some users will be the price the professional version im testing sells for over 800 however the standard version sells for only 99 and offers much the same functionality
4246978 for months we have been telling you that amd has been preparing to release their r600 series documentation as well as opening up the source code to two of their internal software projects used for testing new graphics processor designs prior to the availability of the actual hardware advanced micro devices has yet to release their 3d programming documentation covering the r600 series or the brand new rv770 nor the source code to their two internal projects tcore and kgrids but following several postings in our forums over the past couple of weeks and many emails inquiring about the status today we have a brief update to share
4246979 this amazing device plugs into the iphone ipod dock connector and allows stereo playback over bluetooth enabled stereo speakers or headphones the ap23 does not require charging as it runs off the ipod iphones native power although this may present a problem for the already sketchy battery life found on the iphone 3g
4246980 the only company in the world to market a blank keyboard is back at it again this time with a pair of planks that have been completely redesigned from the ground up can metadots das keyboard shock the world again
4246981 thermalright has undoubtedly created a legendary heatsink with their ultra extreme i am pleased to say that their new true black 120 is no exception and has thoroughly impressed me its performance was second to none on our toasty q6600 test platform not only did it best all sixteen other heatsinks we have tested it did so by a significant margin
4246982 people invest a lot of money on their gaming setup fast internet connection quick response monitor high fidelity headset gaming grade keyboard and mouse but often overlook a prosaic peripheral the mouse pad sure top of the line gaming mice will work even on top of your leg but their performance will lack without the proper surface razer a company known for their gaming peripherals like the piranha headset that we already tested released the destructor their new gaming grade mouse pad model he was our trusty brother in arms on the digital battlefields for the last weeks lets proceed to our test
4246983 when buying a hard disk drive most users are only concerned with the drives capacity should you also care about performance we compared the performance of nine 320 gb sata 300 hard disk drive models from seagate samsung western digital and hitachi is there a big performance difference among them is it worthwhile to pay a little bit more and get a drive with a bigger buffer if so which is the fastest 320 gb in the market check it out
4246984 quaid does an excellent job of being the pompous professor who is seething with some kind of bitterness and disdain for everyone around him we have all met him in one way or another through the movie he holds that odd barely functional personality through mannerisms and the way he walks and talks and facial expressions it was a pleasure to watch
4246985 ecs is very popular on the low end segment so we were really surprised to see this company launching a good high end solution the hydra kit contains two geforce 9800 gtx running at their default clock configuration and one thermaltake bigwater 760is water cooler the video cards come with the cold plates already assembled so the only work you will have to do is to connect the hoses coming from bigwater to the video cards and fill the water tank with the coolant liquid that comes with the kit we took an in depth look on hydra check it out
4246986 just the other day i was talking about how the hd 4870 x2 is a great card for p45 users when i tested hd 4870 in crossfire a few months back on both the p45 and x48 we noticed that the x8 x8 configuration present on the p45 actually gave us a bit of a hit in performance so what were going to do today is chuck a pair of sapphire hd 4870s into a p45 board and do a bunch of tests were then going to pull those two cards out and stick in a single hd 4870 x2 we will run the same tests and proceed to compare since weve already looked at the cards themselves were just going to get stuck straight into the benchmarking side of things lets begin by taking a quick look at our testbed were using today before getting stuck straight into the benchmarks
4246987 one common truth for many gamers is that their budgets are tight gamers are always on the lookout for good low cost gaming peripherals that actually work today we are looking at just such a device from ocz called the alchemy elixir gaming keyboard one thing i have found on every gaming keyboard that i have ever owned is that after using it 8 to 10 hours a day five days a week simply typing not even counting gaming the keys start to wear after a while to remedy this ocz actually includes extra key tops to replace the most commonly used keys including the wasd keys used for movement the spacebar the shift key and the arrow keys extra keys are a feature i have yet to see much more expensive gaming keyboards on the market offer
4246988 this is a very standard usb drive without many special features that would make me recommend it over any other drive to one of my friends the one added feature that makes this drive appealing is that it is intended to take some abuse the sip system in packaging design makes the atp toughdrive waterproof shock proof and dust proof pretty hefty claims in this day and age but the testing backed that up the clip used to attach the toughdrive to your belt loop back pack or key ring appears fairly stout and should make this drive a little easier to keep around i know that i have lost more than my fair share of drives due to poor clips or attachment methods
4246989 with a trio of heatpipe direct touch cpu cooler reviews under our belts i can definitively say that the tech is quickly catching on and spreading like wildfire i am standing strong behind my statement from the last review of a h d t cooler that i think this is the direction most cpu heatsinks will go in the future much like the way nearly all cpu coolers use heatpipes nowadays today we are going to take a look at the hdt sd964 from xigmatek unlike all of the heatpipe direct touch h d t coolers we have looked at thus far this cooler does not use a 120mm fan the hdt sd964 uses a 92mm fan and is a little shorter than the others this will allow the cooler to be placed in smaller enclosures like 4u server chassis and equal sized media center cases
4246990 realistically for us 30 could you really expect more from one single product for a small tidy sum of money you finally will be able to play your favorite tracks in your car instead of having to spend hundreds installing a new mp3 capable deck
4246991 ive seen more 9600 gt cards than i would like to honestly admit the bottom line is though that the card does offer some excellent value for money and if you dont have the budget to buy new high end cards like the hd 4870 or gtx 280 and gtx 260 the 9600 gt still remains a very good option today were going to take the time to check out the latest 9600 gt incarnation from ecs and see what it has to offer over the competition in a time where bundles and overclocks separate brands we see if the latest version from ecs can stand out
4246992 i am getting a puppy this weekend and i have read your my smart puppy book and watched the video but i am not clear on how to teach the no command please help
4246993 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
4246994 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
4246995 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
4246996 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4246997 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4246998 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town
4246999 i just need to take a quick look inside maam this shouldnt take more than a couple of minutes
4247000 maam im afraid you cannot have this beyond this point
4247001 maam the rules clearly state that you cannot have any liquids over 3
4247002 im a hairs breadth away from investigating bunnies at the moment so im open to anything
4247003 first ill do the lassies an then ill do the rest
4247004 the report which specifically addressed speculation appears to have been created and released to influence that senate vote which would be highly improper in our view
4247005 does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices
4247006 we are greatly disturbed that although cftc staff obviously knew that underlying data used to prepare the interim report was seriously flawed the interim report was nonetheless publicly released
4247007 why it was released after the cftc staff had determined that critical information upon which it was based was inaccurate
4247008 in light of the recent increases in energy prices and the resulting concerns of the public and policy makers
4247009 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4247010 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4247011 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4247012 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4247013 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4247014 we have to get to the point of having people pay for what they use or what they choose to do in a health plan
4247015 trying to incentivize people to a different behavior that would be healthier for them was a good thing
4247016 but its something that cant happen for a year and a half i find that frustrating but i guess thats how the wheels of government turn

4247023 nutritious plant based food that could feed humans instead goes to feed animals in a very inefficient use of resources the usda and the united nations state that using an acre of land to raise cattle yields 20 pounds of usable protein if soybeans were grown instead that same acre would yield 356 pounds of protein animal agriculture also wastes valuable water resources population biologists paul and anne ehrlich note that a pound of wheat can be grown with 60 gallons of water whereas a pound of meat requires 2 500 to 6 000 gallons

4247167 no you should have seen it i took a poop right and its kind of big so i decide that i need to flush once now and once after i wipe but then i flush and the toilet clogs even without paper so there i am standing with my pants around my ankles a wad of toilet paper in one hand and the plunger in the other only problem being my natural instinct is to wipe first but then id have nowhere to put it so at this point im really confused
4247168 hey maybe you could leave some scraps for the rest of us

4247175 the optimal position for wearing a backpack is high on the upper back with straps over both shoulders
4247176 kids who wear their backpacks in the more stylish lower back position or only use one strap may suffer shoulder pain and posture problems
4247177 whats interesting here is that contrary to popular belief its not just the weight of the backpack but how its carried
4247178 and the pain generated is not just on the back it includes the pressure on the skin which causes nerve pain similar to that tingling sensation caused when a leg or arm falls asleep
4247179 its possible that our subjects alter their posture by elevating the right shoulder thus increasing the contact pressure on that shoulder
4247180 if those postures are practiced over a long period of time with more weight and pressure on one shoulder it may alter posture and produce prolonged pain we need to study this further
4247181 following these recommendations may require conscious effort from the kids encouragement from parents peers and school staff until it becomes habitual

4247183 parents also need to check what their children are carrying we found that quite often its not just books and school work thats weighing them down but ipods and laptop computers and other things they may not need to carry to school everyday

4247187 some of the criticisms of my games hit home i get the impression that if i make kudos 2 not just lots better than the original but hugely overwhelmingly massively better well polished designed and balanced that a lot of would be pirates will actually buy it

4247322 los mercados han comenzado a preguntarse si el pa s podr a estar al borde de otro default pocos participantes del mercado si es que alguno han olvidado los costos y el drama asociados al default anterior como resultado los mercados est n altamente sensibilizados
4247323 la argentina parece deslizarse r pidamente hacia una posici n desfavorable con costos prohibitivos de financiamiento en momentos en que el fondeo es cada vez m s escaso sin embargo estimamos toda reestructuraci n potencial de la deuda improbable hasta 2010
4247324 las preocupaciones sobre una reestructuraci n de la deuda en el corto plazo parecen exageradas
4247325 mirando hacia adelante la pregunta es ser capaz el gobierno de continuar explotando sus ahorros en 2010 los mercados parecen ser cada vez m s de la opini n de que no
4247326 no vemos la recompra de bonos como un indicio de un cambio fundamental en la pol tica econ mica
4247327 la inflaci n el robusto crecimiento y los altos precios de las commodities
4247328 impacto negativo del retroceso reciente en los precios de las commodities agr colas en las cuentas fiscales y en el desempe o de la econom a real
4247329 es bastante parad jico que un pa s con super vits fiscales gemelos que a n crece a tasas s lidas y cuyas principales exportaciones han tenido un aumento significativo de los precios desde 2003 a n carece de un acceso directo a los mercados y tiene que pagar un 15 para colocar deuda

4247332 desafortunadamente los cambios abruptos de poder en la argentina tienden a ser ca ticos esa es la raz n por la cual los mercados anticipan un default aun cuando los indicadores macroecon micos del pa s son consistentes
4247333 esta es una pel cula que ya conocimos bien es muy dif cil que un gobierno que pierde la confianza de la sociedad pueda recuperarla
4247334 la situaci n es bastante mala y dado el camino que transitan los kirchner esto terminar mal ya que desde sus tiempos en santa cruz ellos no cambian de rumbo cuando eso puede ser visto como una se al de debilidad

4247337 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4247338 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4247339 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4247342 mr talansky will not come to israel he is ready to cooperate the israeli and american governments could eventually find a solution

4247377 russia accused georgia of killing more than 2000 people mostly civilians in south ossetia
4247378 because large areas of georgia are too dangerous for journalists to enter to assess the true scope of the damage
4247379 foolishly and tragically baited the russians or even more foolishly fell into moscows trap

4247428 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4247429 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4247430 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination

4247441 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4247442 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4247443 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4247444 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4247445 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4247446 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4247447 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security
4247448 on this anniversary lets make sure john mccain hears the same message tell john mccain to keep his hands off of our social security
4247449 they took the entire matter out of context in my mind and i worked for the press tribune for four years

4247474 and most notably thats where a lot of the freshmen are especially some of the young linebackers like zach brown and dion guy
4247475 because in high school they started and if youre not a returner its not the most glamorous position
4247476 we call running down the field as part of a coverage team a dummy mission and some people see it like that but i think people on this team including the freshmen are taking special teams more seriously because it is serious if you get a punt blocked or if you let someone return a kick too far

4247564 orasul are farmecul lui te tine in priza toata agitatia nebunia traficul toate astea te mobilizeaza sa tii ritmul imi place orasul dar dupa 8 ani fara concediu cand am fost in vacanta intr o cabana la munte unde ne incalzeam la soba cu lemne pe care le am taiat chiar eu mi am dat seama ca am uitat ceva uitasem de unde am plecat uitasem de bucuria pe care ti o da lucrul cu natura traiul cu natura
4247565 am inceput cu cateva sute de metri patrati acum am trei mii de metri patrati in jurul casei trei mii de metri patrati cu vie livada un helesteu pentru pesti sera in care cresc rosii si crizanteme am si vreo 10 porumbei doi caini ciobanesti si un pisoi pe care il cheama machupichu
4247566 vin in bucuresti cel putin o data la doua saptamani pentru activitatile culturale pe care le ofera pentru unele probleme legate de firma si pentru diverse utilitati sunt perioade in care am nevoie sa stau aici pentru afaceri pentru intalniri cu clientii sau cu partenerii dar timpul in bucuresti a devenit o corvoada
4247567 o capcana chiar daca e mic e un oras industrial foarte traficat foarte aglomerat foarte poluat foarte zgomotos
4247568 exact asa cum am visat ca trebuie sa fie o casa de vacanta e din lemn are semineu din piatra de rau raul care trece chiar pe langa gardul meu o mansarda cu fereastra spre cer un foisor in curte o gradina de trandafiri de care numai eu ma ating o piscina tapetata tot cu piatra de rau si un teren pe care mai jucam fotbal sau tenis vara
4247569 m as muta aici dar pe langa faptul ca e totusi departe de birou trebuie sa recunosc ca sunt un animal de oras si oricat mi ar placea sa fac singura curat la cabana si sa tund trandafiri ma cam inspaimanta gandul ca abia in doi ani vom avea apa curenta de exemplu
4247570 locuinta mea de vara care e si cea de primavara toamna si iarna pentru ca de cateva luni m am mutat langa oras in prima localitate rurala spre vest de pe terasa casei vad in departare blocurile de la intrarea din oras dar ma bucur ca in jurul meu sunt livezi de pomi fructiferi gazon si chiar capite de fan

4247574 s ar putea sa avem un mic boom in toamna datorita angajarii absolventilor de facultate sau de liceu care vor fi obligati sa contribuie la un fond de pensii obligatorii de la finalul campaniei de aderare initiala la mijlocul lunii ianuarie n r lucrurile nu au mers stralucit pentru ca doar circa 16 000 de persoane au aderat la fondurile de pensii
4247575 numarul de participanti ai fondului nostru va creste cu maximum 5 000 pe an din toamna intentionam sa ne concentram pe vanzari pentru ca pana acum am fost concentrati pe investitii
4247576 este greu pentru un fond mic sa faca plasamente pentru ca trebuie sa ai un anumit volum mai ales atunci cand vrei sa plasezi in obligatiuni sau in tilturi de stat am investit pana acum doar pe piata locala nu am iesit in strainatate pentru ca pe pe o parte comisioanele de tranzactionare sunt mai mari iar pe de alta parte exista riscul de curs valutar
4247577 va fi o infuzie de capital la bursa ceea ce o va face mai lichida si mai putin supusa fluctuatiilor in prezent bursa romaneasca reactioneaza emotional la ceea ce se intampla in strainatate este o piata imatura sunt companii care raporteaza profituri in crestere dar ale caror actiuni scad

4247723 directorii executivi sunt cei responsabili din punct de vedere legal pentru actiunile companiei iar legile si normele din pensii private contin sanctiuni foarte dure pana la sapte ani de inchisoare in anumite cazuri combinatia de responsabilitate legala si lipsa aproape totala a controlului asupra operatiunilor derulate de companie face pozitia de ceo al unei companii de pensii private greu de pastrat
4247724 daca ceva merge prost in operatiuni marketing sau pe partea financiara directorul executiv este primul sanctionat cu amenda sau inchisoare chiar daca nu a avut legatura cu cele intamplate nu m ar surprinde sa vad si alti directori executivi de companii de pensii parasindu si functiile in momentul in care vor intelege acest lucru
4247725 majoritatea directorilor de companii de pensii sunt prinsi intr o mare capcana pentru ca nu au autoritate reala in organizatiile lor iar oamenii care teoretic ar trebui sa le raporteze lor de fapt le raporteaza actionarilor directorii executivi sunt cei care trebuie sa suporte greul reglementarilor dure impuse de comisia de supraveghere a sistemului de pensii private acest lucru te epuizeaza emotional si nu poate fi suportat la nesfarsit

4247784 at best the 3g coverage is poor out of the city area so why would you expect apple iphone to work well

4247840 i m trying to forge a new team starting with network staff followed by office staff

4247847 i do not do newspaper ads i do not do open houses
4247848 referrals and the internet provide almost all of my buyers
4247849 our group sold 16 million worth of property in 2006
4247850 and we sold 26 million in property in 2007 a bad year by most anyones measure it is the internet that has enabled us to do this and it is our compasssearch subscription that has brought us much of that 10 million increase
4247851 we regularly field inquires from service people stationed in iraq
4247852 as their tour ends or if they are to receive major medical attention many of them are routed to san antonio
4247853 my local knowledge enabled me to set her fears at rest and to help her select a comfortable and safe neighborhood near the place she will be working all online
4247854 the doctor is flying here to meet with me and to buy a 300 400 000 home well be looking at the field of available properties we narrowed down to three and she will choose one of those i have them pre qualified and i am looking forward to meeting her after all this e mailing and excitement
4247855 ive done this so often that i know people are very comfortable sharing this information and i believe it helps bond them with me as their real estate professional
4247856 i explain some of the questions in advance like why i ask about children for example i also explain to them should they send me a house they found online if i think they should not buy that house and why
4247857 people arent offended if you spend time with them and seek to answer their questions then try to narrow down their price range i have found that opening with that line can offend people and send the wrong message that i am only interested in a sale you see i am really interested in my client and i feel every one of them is a part of my extended family
4247858 i dont want to sell them a home that i wouldnt want back to sell again
4247859 if i wouldnt be proud to list the home i surely dont want one of my clients buying it if you havent been able to tell yet i am very motherly i treat these kids as my own and anyone under 50 is a kid to me
4247860 we added two new associates at the end of 2007 to help handle the leads
4247861 were up to five selling and one administrator now we are closing about 90 of these leads
4247862 we also use the webreportertool to show listing prospects our internet savvy and success they are extremely impressed when i show them how much we sell through the internet and what people online do to find their listing on my site
4247863 i also spent the money to have a professional virtual assistant work with my site and make it more consumer friendly
4247864 with the virtual assistant handling the consumer friendly part and compasssearch handling the seo friendly part i feel confident that my success will continue my compasssearch subscription put another 200 000 in my personal take home pay last year a great return on the investment
4247865 get yourself a good template website and hook up with compasssearch the website alone didnt produce great results until i added the search subscription thats all it took me and i cannot tell you how happy i am with the results

4247881 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority its time to pause and reflect
4247882 unless we get a substantial new lead or perhaps a new witness stepping forward or someone confesses to the crime it is highly unlikely that youll see the investigation reaching a successful conclusion in the sense of a criminal prosecution that leads to a conviction
4247883 that doesnt mean theres any less determination to solve it it means we need something new to investigate because what we currently have has been investigated to destruction
4247884 there was a feeling that those responsible were going to be caught very shortly i never thought i would be sitting talking about it 10 years after the event
4247885 and as far as justice is concerned were as far back as we were 10 years ago
4247886 people rightly expect that we will take whatever measures we can properly and legitimately to bring those responsible to justice
4247887 we will continue to try to bring the perpetrators to court and to lock them up for a very long time
4247888 i fully understand their frustration because i think its probably the same as my frustration
4247889 they had an absolute right to have that crime brought to justice in the traditional sense and put through the courts and to see the people who committed that atrocity locked up and literally the key thrown away

4247925 some paintings belong not to the people of iowa so much as to the people of the world and belong in a world class collection which frankly the university of iowa museum of art isnt remember that the idea was never to simply sell mural off to the highest bidder it was to sell it to another museum and im pretty sure theres more than one major us institution which could rustle up a nine figure sum pretty much overnight if the painting were to come on the market one of the reasons that contemporary art goes for such huge sums at auction is that nearly all the major art of the past is now in museums and therefore cant be bought for any sum but theres a corollary to that well known fact which is that some of the greatest paintings of all time have washed up in relative backwaters which dont and cant do them justice n ot all museums are equal and theres surely a case to be made that the greatest of the great masterworks belong in museums which are worthy of them rather than in small university collections mural will in fact be arriving at moma in 2010 on temporary loan from iowa it will consort there with its peers and take its rightful place in the art historical pantheon and then it will go back to the midwest whence it came out of sight and far off the beaten track

4247934 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4247935 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4247936 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself

4247948 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4247949 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4247950 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4247951 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4247952 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4247953 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4247954 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4247955 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4247956 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4247957 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4247958 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4247959 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4247960 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4247961 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4247962 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4247963 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4247964 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4247965 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4247966 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4247967 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4247968 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4247969 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4247970 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4247971 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4247972 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4247973 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4247974 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4247975 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4247976 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4247977 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4247978 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4247979 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4247980 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4247981 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4247982 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4247983 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4247984 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4247985 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4247986 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4247987 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4247988 who are open to doing something on the production side
4247989 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4247990 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4247991 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4247992 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4247993 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4247994 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4247995 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4247996 since arriving in 2006 liz has led a resurgence at prevention that has been nothing short of remarkable
4247997 her pitch perfect understanding of what the prevention reader wants sets liz apart and her ability to build a dynamic brand is matched by her ability to build a dynamic staff we look forward to seeing her bring our many ambitious and exciting goals for the prevention brand to life
4247998 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4247999 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4248000 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4248001 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4248002 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4248003 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4248004 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4248005 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4248006 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4248007 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4248008 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4248009 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4248010 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4248011 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4248012 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4248013 we face a lot of legislative and regulatory issues we resourced our advocacy to match our challenges
4248014 the association is pleased that hhs is taking its advice
4248015 i think these ballots need to be up in tallahassee now so whatever needs to be done can be done quickly
4248016 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
4248017 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4248018 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4248019 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4248020 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4248021 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4248022 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4248023 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4248024 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4248025 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4248026 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4248027 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4248028 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4248029 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4248030 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4248031 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4248032 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4248033 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4248034 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4248035 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4248036 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4248037 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4248038 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4248039 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4248040 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4248041 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4248042 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4248043 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4248044 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4248045 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4248046 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4248047 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4248048 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4248049 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4248050 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4248051 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4248052 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4248053 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4248054 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4248055 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4248056 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4248057 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4248058 the veepstakes buzz today appears to be that barack obama is seriously considering selecting evan bayh as his running mate and while there have been a number of other boomlets for vp candidates in recent weeks the timing of this one coupled with the fact that bayh unlike a number of other names in the news hasnt been assigned a speaking spot at the upcoming convention indicates that the buzz might have the ring of truth
4248059 regardless of bayhs merits as a running mate and potential vice president his selection would carry with it one immutable and giant negative the inauguration of vice president bayh would very likely create a new republican senator indiana gov mitch daniels is a bush loyalist who has a substantial 10 15 point lead over democrat jill long thompson in his bid for re election as much as wed like to hope for the best its improbable that long thompson is going to defeat daniels now indiana democrats will point out that long thompson has done well in fundraising and that the presence of bayh on the ticket would undoubtedly help her but the fact remains that daniels is more likely than not going to win the race and that means that he would have the ability to appoint bayhs successor in the senate
4248060 democrats can expect to come out of november with 55 58 senate seats not including joe lieberman wholl probably go along with the democrats on a number of cloture votes that puts us in a very good position to beat filibusters on a number of crucial legislative initiatives but every seat that goes to a far right republican is a body blow to our ability to really take advantage of our majority barack obama needs to ask himself whether evan bayh is worth possibly losing meaningful health reform or immigration reform
4248061 in contrast to his indefatigable passionate and legislatively masterful father evan bayhs approach to policy and politics comes off as flat and squeezes the air sizzle and enthusiasm out of the obama balloon
4248062 there is reluctance in my heart as i know there is in the other senators to contemplate the use of force
4248063 we were simply left with no other credible alternative to protect the safety and well being of the american people
4248064 he was not only wrong he was aggressively wrong in my view he would contradict if not undermine the obama message of change turning a new page on foreign policy and national security
4248065 we are not going to get into which particular person is good or bad we hope that emphasizing senator obamas judgment against the war is something they consider in making their pick
4248066 advocacy for the war could complicate his prospects for getting on the ticket despite bayh having served as a popular two term governor who could make indiana a competitive state and appeal to blue collar democrats who have been slow to embrace mr obama
4248067 appeared to dim the changes that the states current governor would be selected
4248068 typically complement the presidential candidate mr kaine 50 more replicates mr obama he is an inspiring speaker a harvard trained lawyer who spurned corporate work for civil rights
4248069 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4248070 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4248071 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4248072 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4248073 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4248074 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4248075 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4248076 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4248077 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4248078 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4248079 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4248080 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4248081 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4248082 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4248083 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4248084 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4248085 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4248086 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4248087 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4248088 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4248089 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4248090 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4248091 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4248092 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4248093 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4248094 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4248095 who will be the next president of the united states
4248096 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4248097 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4248098 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4248099 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4248100 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4248101 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4248102 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4248103 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4248104 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4248105 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4248106 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4248107 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4248108 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4248109 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4248110 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4248111 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4248112 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4248113 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

4248125 no dios dijo que no tocaramos las manzanas y no lo vamos a hacer

4248130 moises tu liberaras a mi pueblo toma mi baston de harry potter
4248131 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4248132 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4248133 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4248134 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4248135 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4248136 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4248137 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4248138 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4248139 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4248140 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4248141 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4248142 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4248143 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4248144 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4248145 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4248146 proponents ot prop 8 genuinely endorse the existing civil unions
4248147 removing the right of children to be raised by both of their natural parents
4248148 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4248149 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4248150 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4248151 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4248152 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4248153 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4248154 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4248155 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4248156 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
4248157 mindless idiots out there who blindly follow the repug rhetoric
4248158 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4248159 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4248160 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4248161 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4248162 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4248163 just so you all know we did set a record
4248164 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4248165 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4248166 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4248167 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4248168 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4248169 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4248170 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4248171 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4248172 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4248173 yes i am saying and it is true that georgia had the legal and morally justifiable right to use force and launch attacks to preserve their union
4248174 seems like president bush has more on the ball environmentally speaking than al gore does
4248175 and that is why democrats cannot seem to connect with joe q public
4248176 in the here and now in the eyes of joe q public the gop is better suited to lead
4248177 the fear mongering human caused global warming hysterics would have everyone believe that any global warming is bad they conveniently ignore all the actual benefits that a little warming would bring
4248178 and yet if edwards was a republican the left blogosphere would be all over it like white on rice
4248179 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4248180 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4248181 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4248182 someone driving to work goes past a petrol station and sees petrol at a bargain price and thinks you beauty but when they drive home its gone up 10c a litre it makes people very angry
4248183 australians dont want that great volatility in prices but nor do they want to pay more for their petrol to do away with it
4248184 the government wants to see an end to the days when you drive past a petrol station in the morning and see a certain price and drive past in the afternoon and see a price 10c or 15c a litre higher
4248185 i just dont think its going to do what its meant to do
4248186 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4248187 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4248188 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4248189 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4248190 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4248191 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4248192 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4248193 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4248194 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4248195 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4248196 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4248197 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4248198 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4248199 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4248200 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4248201 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
4248202 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
4248203 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4248204 we could start seeing actual cooler temperatures in 2013 and beyond
4248205 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4248206 billof rights there is a mountain of evidence that bush is incompetent
4248207 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4248208 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4248209 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4248210 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4248211 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4248212 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4248213 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4248214 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4248215 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4248216 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4248217 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4248218 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4248219 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4248220 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4248221 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4248222 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4248223 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4248224 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4248225 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4248226 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4248227 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4248228 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4248229 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4248230 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4248231 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4248232 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4248233 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
4248234 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
4248235 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
4248236 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4248237 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4248238 was consistently within the top 5 of his class as a whole
4248239 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
4248240 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4248241 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4248242 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4248243 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4248244 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4248245 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4248246 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4248247 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4248248 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4248249 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4248250 steel futures and energy prices are coming down from their peak and if we deliver the building later we hope it will be launched into the peak of the next upturn for city rents
4248251 see out many economic cycles with a dependability few businesses can match
4248252 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4248253 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4248254 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4248255 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4248256 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4248257 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4248258 i am deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in zimbabwe where despite requests made by the united nations country team and other humanitarian partners operations of voluntary and non governmental organizations remain restricted
4248259 lifted immediately so that aid organizations can carry out their relief work and avert a catastrophic humanitarian crisis
4248260 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined the club from auxerre in january 2006 and his transfer to manchester city in january 2008 was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4248261 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4248262 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4248263 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4248264 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4248265 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4248266 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4248267 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4248268 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4248269 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4248270 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4248271 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4248272 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4248273 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4248274 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4248275 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4248276 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4248277 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4248278 there will be no more flowers sent my loved ones are getting giant fortune cookies from now on
4248279 with photoshop elements im able to capture memories that are very special to me in my life and create beautiful works of art
4248280 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4248281 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4248282 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4248283 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4248284 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4248285 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4248286 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4248287 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4248288 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4248289 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4248290 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4248291 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4248292 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4248293 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4248294 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4248295 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4248296 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4248297 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4248298 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4248299 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4248300 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4248301 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4248302 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4248303 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4248304 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4248305 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4248306 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4248307 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4248308 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4248309 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4248310 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4248311 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4248312 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4248313 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4248314 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4248315 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4248316 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4248317 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4248318 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4248319 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4248320 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4248321 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4248322 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4248323 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4248324 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4248325 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4248326 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4248327 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4248328 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4248329 were very excited about our upcoming 1000th episode and tonights taping
4248330 we have a lot of friends and colleagues coming down tonight and hope everyone will join us in celebrating
4248331 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4248332 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4248333 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4248334 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4248335 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4248336 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4248337 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4248338 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4248339 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4248340 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4248341 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4248342 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4248343 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4248344 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4248345 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4248346 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4248347 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4248348 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4248349 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4248350 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4248351 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4248352 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4248353 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4248354 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
4248355 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
4248356 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
4248357 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4248358 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4248359 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4248360 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4248361 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
4248362 prison facilities in the area do not pick up hitchhikers
4248363 duic acted contrary to ontario securities law and contrary to the public interest by engaging in the transactions in breach of the cease trade order
4248364 he accepts that he did and hell go before the commission and let them decide what the appropriate consequence should be
4248365 to engage in the illegal insider trading that was the subject of the settlement agreement
4248366 the steady drum beat of double digit sales declines this year is beginning to weight more heavily on prices
4248367 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4248368 however the drop in july spread to a few more cities including the previously untouchable vancouver market
4248369 this combination of mounting new listings and fading sales has pushed the market into buyers territory in many cities rapidly undercutting pricing power
4248370 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4248371 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007 which was a record year for mls sales
4248372 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4248373 i dont know what happened one minute is was cleaning the house and okay yeah so i had a couple drink in me but the hoover was just looking so fine you know those curves that plastic sheen
4248374 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4248375 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence
4248376 if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to
4248377 self the time is rapidly running out for speculating about al gore running for president being selected as obamas vp what fun will punditry be then
4248378 she was just standing in the driveway rocking the newborn who was still attached to the placenta
4248379 i took an iq test and the results were negative
4248380 es ist etwas sch nes dabei zu sein ich versuche gas zu geben und zu zeigen was ich drauf habe
4248381 security problems go away by mandating independent security testing before a product is accepted not by trying to get security researchers to be quiet this is a good example of how the reactive approach doesnt work the flaws are still in the system and suing researchers has just shined a bright light on them
4248382 a mix of new yorks young and liberal have assembled to witness a poetry slam this years championship the biggest to date boasted 76 teams sent from across the united states as well as one from paris
4248383 what is music it is a combination of harmonious sounds what is poetry it is a symmetrical collection of words therefore they are pleasing through harmony and rhythm poetry is much more effective and complete than prose it stirs more deeply for it is of a finer composition
4248384 as a persian poet has written the celestial universe is so formed that the under world reflects the upper world that is to say whatever exists in heaven is reflected in this phenomenal world now praise be to god this meeting of ours is a reflection of the heavenly concourse it is as though we had taken a mirror and had gazed into it this reflection from the heavenly concourse we know as love
4248385 to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing
4248386 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4248387 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4248388 from here i would like to declare that we have a huge respect for the east and their people
4248389 anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4248390 how could a good god allow people to go to hell

4248402 we cant stop anyone here as long as they arent violating our regulations
4248403 we dont want any intervention or request from any country which isnt in line with our basic principles
4248404 al manar its parent and affiliates form a recognized arm of hizbullah a designated terrorist organization under multiple counterterrorism authorities
4248405 the us government has expressed and will continue to express its concerns about hizbullah and al manar television worldwide and remains firmly opposed to their exploitation of the media to promote terrorist acts including broadcasts designed to incite imminent violence and likely to produce violence
4248406 many clients have not only become our friends but also friends with each other
4248407 they say if its healthy it isnt good we say otherwise
4248408 for me its a big kitchen i just want to give you a good bite
4248409 whenever you think of food you would cook in your home think of kitchi

4248412 i want the hours i spend at work to be productive on both the human side and financial side
4248413 just last week a woman put an ad for yoga lessons in our window
4248414 we want it to be a homey place where people come in and feel happy
4248415 we want full amnesty to more than 300 islamist detainees before the beginning of the holy month of ramadan
4248416 condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in tripoli
4248417 to bring the perpetrators organizers financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism to justice
4248418 an end to impunity to violence in lebanon and reiterated full support for all ongoing efforts to combat terrorism solidify democratic institutions engage in political dialogue and pursue national reconciliation
4248419 that the government and the people of lebanon will not allow this heinous terrorist act to hamper the achievement made in establishing national reconciliation permanent peace and stability in lebanon in the recent period
4248420 in a series of hellish attacks aimed at the state the rule of law and stability
4248421 all political parties must support the lebanese army and security forces so that our soldiers can perform their duties without hesitation
4248422 the uae welcomes the announcement issued at the end of the meetings between presidents assad and sleiman that the two brotherly countries will establish diplomatic ties
4248423 such relations must be built on mutual respect the kind that can exist only between friendly states if we discuss these relations honestly we can reach a solution
4248424 we should all cooperate to restrict weapons smuggling across the lebanese syrian border
4248425 relations between lebanon and syria must be based on mutual respect
4248426 should be nothing less than diplomatic ties between two sovereign states
4248427 both countries should pledge not to meddle in each others internal affairs
4248428 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4248429 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4248430 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4248431 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4248432 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end
4248433 to activate and step up the work of the joint committee on people missing from both countries
4248434 timetable and schedule of priorities agreed upon by both sides
4248435 we insist now more than anytime before on the need to discuss and come up with a defense strategy for lebanon so that we all know how we can defend our country
4248436 we informed president sleimans advisers that there are two crucial points to be discussed during dialogue meetings
4248437 coming up with a national strategy to rebuild the lebanese state as well as a strategy to solve the entrenched economic and social problems are two crucial items to be discussed
4248438 and this in no way means overlooking or introducing changes to the taif accord which put an end to lebanons 1975 1990 civil war
4248439 will lead to a total collapse of the lebanese economy
4248440 to consider the visit in a positive light and shun tensions
4248441 a positive attitude will help in solving all pending matters between the two countries
4248442 we are no aliens to beirut we are an integral part of the capital and we wish all the best to beirut and its residents
4248443 as well as other issues as soon as dna tests are completed
4248444 we will pursue our efforts to build a strong and capable lebanon
4248445 does bring with him some commitments that we had not heard until now about diplomatic relations border demarcations and all that there is something to talk about
4248446 these two countries cant have a divorce from each other
4248447 it is historic in the point the perspective of having embassies it is like the final say that lebanon is sovereign independent not a part of syria and so on
4248448 maybe in this perspective it is historic but the visit itself it is not historic it is not like the meeting of former lebanese president fouad shehab and former egyptian president gamal abdel nasser on the lebanese syrian border in 1958
4248449 it is not the historic visit they are trying to depict
4248450 it is the normal thing to have this kind of relationship
4248451 what can an embassy in lebanon change does an embassy and diplomatic relationship enhance or endanger syrian lebanese relations for the syrians what is there to lose
4248452 i dont think there will be any policy changes in terms in lebanon
4248453 all these things are not going to be steps now
4248454 there are very old maps they are mostly historical documents that could be traced all the way to the sykes picot agreement of 1920
4248455 it is like a win win situation for the syrians
4248456 what syria is giving lebanon is to enhance its situation and what syria is not giving lebanon is also to enhance syrias situation but in a different context for instance shebaa it is still within the regional game it can still be used in the negotiations with israel
4248457 when syria says not to delimit shebaa farms you have to say goodbye to the un initiative
4248458 the americans are paralyzed israel is paralyzed no more pressure on the syrians neither arab nor american and now they are fulfilling their promises to sarkozy
4248459 maintaining tight security measures was also discussed during the meeting
4248460 this act could have been carried out to drag the army into a confrontation
4248461 will not deter the army from its duty to defend the nation
4248462 the generous blood tax which our soldiers have paid is a spontaneous response to the oath they have sworn the moment they joined the institution of honor sacrifice and loyalty
4248463 i highly appreciate your participation in honoring lebanons martyrs and respect your national affection and loyal zeal in expressing your support for the army i also offer my deep condolences to the families friends and leaders of our heroes
4248464 was wounded by a gunshot in the shoulder as he was crossing syria street
4248465 there was a desire on both sides to find a conclusion to this issue
4248466 this is a very important agreement this turns a new page in our relationship
4248467 this agreement signed today is designed to resolve the last major historical issue that has stood in the way of a more normal relationship between our two countries
4248468 under this agreement each countrys citizens can receive fair compensation for past incidents when fulfilled the agreement will permit libya and the us to develop their relations
4248469 the important role libya is playing internationally and expressed his hope that cooperation between the two countries would continue
4248470 flooding south lebanon israels use of cluster munitions in lebanon in july and august 2006
4248471 israels strikes in 2006 were the most extensive use of cluster munitions anywhere in the world since the 1991 gulf war
4248472 the treaty contains the strongest provisions for victim assistance ever laid down in international law
4248473 for lebanese civilians the war did not end when the cease fire was signed
4248474 aid to the country for clearance and support to victims stands to be considerably boosted
4248475 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
4248476 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
4248477 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the body of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
4248478 we work very closely with local authorities we dont work anywhere where we are not wanted
4248479 enemies of afghan people who do not want the international community to help the poverty hit afghan people
4248480 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
4248481 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
4248482 cowardly attack yet again shows the depravity of the taliban and the bleak alternative that they represent
4248483 sanciones muy severas que van desde 15 hasta 20 a os de prisi n

4248487 i see this within a spate of attacks against the army that could be reprisal attacks for the armys crushing of fatah al islam last year
4248488 a clear message to the army warning it against playing an effective role
4248489 may hasten sleimans demand for faster stability that will probably mean a rapid appointment of an army commander and heads of the security agencies
4248490 for that they will need a kind of green light from damascus
4248491 i would like to go to amman to stand trial however what i fear is that i am convicted in advance
4248492 highlight that there are some terrorists who misuse islam and they take it as their spiritual ammunition
4248493 i wanted to depict the terrorists as if they were taking the prophet mohammad as a hostage i have no problem with islam but with the terrorists
4248494 blaspheming the prophet mohammad and islam as well as sowing religious and sectarian discord
4248495 we welcome his reasonable approach but in our opinion this person has committed a crime and should be punished
4248496 iran in world politics the question of the islamic republic
4248497 we hope that the cabinet will be able to review and endorse the next draft budget in october of this year
4248498 the legislators of mauritania support the change that occurred in the interest of the mauritanian people
4248499 we regret that all of the attempts made by members of parliament and other well intentioned people failed to lessen the stubbornness of the former president who did not listen to his constituents
4248500 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4248501 we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
4248502 pakistan is passing through a very critical moment in its history and our enemies are trying to weaken us externally and internally
4248503 he wants safe passage after breaking the law he wants safe passage after violating the constitution he wants safe passage after bargaining our sovereignty
4248504 our democratic coalition government has adopted a policy of reconciliation we should move forward for national progress
4248505 the period of oppression is over forever dictatorship has become a story of the past
4248506 committed to bringing relief to the common man to steer pakistan out of the current political economic situation
4248507 i am pleased to announce on independence day that the impeachment process is moving fast and is on the right track
4248508 summoned to the foreign ministry today and handed a protest note over the iranian measure
4248509 the memorandum of understanding did not transfer sovereignty over abu musa or any part of it to the islamic republic of iran
4248510 they were ambushed by insurgents hours before they opened fire on the bus the bodies of five civilians killed in the incident were brought to wanlaweyn
4248511 the driver told us that the ethiopian forces sprayed gunfire on the minibus it was dark and maybe they could not identify whether they were insurgents or civilians
4248512 we believe that dialogue is the best way to resolve the issue and we are always ready for dialogue
4248513 those who do not respect that will lose themselves there will be no change in the will of the iranian people
4248514 the talks in geneva were positive and we believe that a positive direction was found
4248515 we believe it will be reasonable to discuss the common issues in those packages and reach a compromise this could pave the way for resolving the disputed issues
4248516 we expect the negotiation process to continue with the good will of all parties and reach a positive outcome in a short time
4248517 god made me for china but he also made me fast and when i run i feel his pleasure
4248518 if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped
4248519 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4248520 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4248521 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4248522 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4248523 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4248524 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4248525 to kill a mockingbird it was a book that i read in middle school i enjoy it because it is a classic the book has characters that you will always remmember
4248526 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4248527 there are too many instances on iphone blogs and apples own website for it to be coincidence furthermore it is not just the us but other countries as well
4248528 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting
4248529 the phones great to use im just not happy with the setup
4248530 i think they rolled out the phones prematurely and once the phones sold they tried to sort out the connectivity but are finding problems and they are still charging inflated rates
4248531 and dont get me started on the battery life of the phone im only getting three days battery life instead of the up to 300 hours as in the specifications
4248532 at best the 3g coverage is poor out of the city area so why would you expect apple iphone to work well
4248533 this can be due to a number of factors including your height above street level the nature of your building hills between you and the cell site and atmospheric conditions
4248534 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
4248535 where exactly the same genes can produce different heritability depending on the environment
4248536 environment was widely different for everyone much more of the difference would come from experience
4248537 although the heritability index for schizophrenia is large about 85 this metric encompasses the neglected contribution of gene environment interactions as well as the high profile genetic component
4248538 provides economic incentives for new grocery stores and restaurants with table service
4248539 who sells high quality hot dogs from cattle raised on pasture served with fresh grilled onions on top
4248540 our policy makers abhor nuance and the subtle but distinct qualities that differentiate fast food from food that can be served fast
4248541 its insulting and you could almost infer a racial insult out of the interference
4248542 when people have small incomes the grocery store is five miles away and a 1 cheeseburger is right around the corner
4248543 anybody who believes fast food is the source of all dietary evil is of course being naive
4248544 we give employees time to go out and hurt themselves during the day
4248545 not only do we lose productivity but we increase the likelihood of their getting sick but if you want to take care of yourself we say do it on your own dime now what makes sense about that
4248546 es ist etwas sch nes dabei zu sein ich versuche gas zu geben und zu zeigen was ich drauf habe
4248547 we have been staying in this camp for two days my daughter is still in loi sam which we left due to heavy shelling by the army
4248548 when we left my eight year old daughter gul zari had severe abdominal pain due to which she stayed back with her grandmother
4248549 about 12 000 families have left bajaur agency which has a total population of 900 000 persons
4248550 people have been migrating not only to lower and upper dir but also to peshawar mardan and charsadda
4248551 we provide meals medicines and other necessities of life to these people
4248552 i lost my two teenaged sons due to bombing by the military in loi sam
4248553 may god destroy both the taliban and the army who are responsible for the death of my son
4248554 we arrived here just today tuesday we are with our uncle
4248555 jamil was playing outside the house when a bomb hit him and we found his body scattered all over the place
4248556 may god destroy both the taliban and the army who are responsible for the death of my son
4248557 more than 400 families have arrived in peshawar they are looking for rented houses but due to sky high rents they cannot afford houses here
4248558 der blick f r das eigene baby wird oftmals durch den st ndigen blick in erziehungsratgeber entwicklungstabellen oder auf andere kinder verstellt
4248559 was eltern dann schlussfolgern ist mein baby macht einen r ckschritt denn fr her war doch nicht so ich muss etwas falsch gemacht haben was aber eigentlich dahinter steckt ist das baby kommt in die phase des fremdelns und der trennungsangst es macht keinen r ck sondern einen klaren fortschritt da es nun eindeutig zwischen vertraut und fremd unterscheiden kann
4248560 mit mehr flexibilit t und k rzeren kursabschnitten gehen wir auf die bed rfnisse der eltern und deren babys ein
4248561 wer m chte und sich bereit f hlt kann das baby auf probe in der obhut der gruppe berlassen
4248562 uns ist besonders wichtig dass sich in der gruppe ein netzwerk bildet das auch nach ende des kurses weiterbesteht
4248563 gerade in einer gro stadt wie frankfurt in der viele alleinerziehende und eltern ohne direkten familienanschluss leben ist ein solches netzwerk wichtig um einen entspannten einkauf oder einen kurzfristigen arzttermin nicht zu einem unl sbaren problem werden zu lassen
4248564 eltern haben heute sehr viel wissen ber erziehung und verlieren oftmals das vertrauen in ihre eigene intuition aber sie sind die fachleute sie kennen ihr kind am besten
4248565 wir haben die bed rfnisse der eltern immer im auge entwickeln unsere kurse weiter oder erfinden neue angebote ohne eine solche innovationskraft h tte die familienbildung bald ausgedient
4248566 mit den steigenden anspr chen der eltern der flexibilisierung der berufswelt und dem st ndigen gesellschaftlichen wandel haben wir zuk nftig gro e aufgaben vor uns nur wenn wir jetzt perspektiven entwickeln k nnen wir auch zuk nftig eine unterst tzung f r familien sein
4248567 wie f r andere medien gilt auch f r pc und internet der schutz vor sch dlichen inhalten und das richtige ma des medienkonsums m ssen oberste priorit t haben
4248568 mit dem kinderschutz programm erhalten eltern eine hervorragende hilfe doch die beste technik kann ein gespr ch zwischen eltern und kindern nicht ersetzen
4248569 die kinder verstehen die welt des internets heute oft besser als ihre eltern und bewegen sich mit einer unglaublichen leichtigkeit in ihr das computerbild kinderschutzprogramm ist dabei eine wunderbare hilfe f r die eltern
4248570 and they want me out of congress the liberal democrats want me out and they want me out because im a conservative voice if we can silence that person thats exactly what we want we want more mushers up here in congress that wont speak out and stand out they want a obamajority in this country tom is on the obamajority list for the us house of representatives they want to get him in there because they know he is going to be voting with them they want to control the white house 60 votes in the us senate and a strong majority in the us house of representatives
4248571 these lakes are fed by hydrothermal waters that leach out arsenic containing minerals from the surrounding rocks
4248572 we suspected that these bacteria were using arsenic to make a living so we scraped the biofilms off the rock and studied them under laboratory conditions
4248573 we think that bacteria were photosynthesising before oxygen was present in the atmosphere
4248574 fear is something that has just not be prayed for yet
4248575 its nice to think we might f word it up a little bit and that they might not know where to play our records

4248605 starfish has a program that is well suited to todays dynamic and demanding transportation marketplace
4248606 while consumers may want a smaller more fuel efficient vehicle they dont want to compromise on the feature and option content
4248607 nearly all consumers want the same or greater number of features and options in their next vehicle
4248608 that consumers are looking for better fuel efficiency today is not surprising
4248609 that they are unlikely to give up the features they currently have and may want even more features and options has strong implications for automotive manufacturers and dealers

4248617 i am pleased with our first half performance even as the general advertising environment remains soft due to macroeconomic conditions our radio cluster continues to deliver solid organic growth even while facing difficult comparisons to the first half of 2007 when the segment grew by 22 our top rated internally produced television programming has allowed us to achieve significant increases in our national and agency driven advertising business which has helped offset softness in infomercial advertising revenues one of our key business strategies is to leverage the success of our internally produced programming and tap into new revenue streams such as network advertising we believe the ratings success we have achieved in television validates our leading position amongst the nations most prominent hispanic broadcasters in several of the nations largest and most competitive markets to that end we are proud to announce the launch of estrellatv a new spanish language television network featuring our successful programming which will debut in early 2009 consistent with this strategy we have entered into an agreement to purchase selected assets of television station kvpa in phoenix arizona which we are very excited about our entry into the 8th largest hispanic market in the u s with proven operating management and programming expertise should establish a positive platform for future growth

4248625 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4248626 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4248627 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4248628 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4248629 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4248630 we believe that missile defense is a susbstantial contribution to natos collective security
4248631 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict

4248633 mathis veteran experience in both mls and international arenas bolsters our roster he has performed on huge stages in mls in the bundesliga and in the world cup clint gives us options at multiple positions and will immediately add depth skill and another set of intangibles to our emerging team
4248634 clint provides veteran depth for us in four attacking positions this acquisition along with that of robbie russell on the defensive side we feel we have reinforced an already strong core of players clint had chances to play elsewhere but his first choice was to come back and play for rsl we want players that want to be here and firmly believe clint will be a good teammate and a good addition to rsl
4248635 im looking forward coming back to salt lake i feel like i have some unfinished business here and look forward to playing again in front of these great fans and for my former teammate jason kreis

4248639 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one

4248644 today we wrote this op ed in order to set the record straight about some of the misleading claims based on inaccurate and misleading misrepresentations of obamas economic plan
4248645 what we have here is once again shifting rhetoric over time driven by his ambition to become president of the united states
4248646 its useful to remember that even with the latest shift in his rhetoric the reality is that what barack obama is proposing is not to raise taxes on everyone to increase government spending and he does not seem to have a particular emphasis on job creation
4248647 has been consistent over time and which lowers taxes for everyone

4248919 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4248920 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4248921 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4248922 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4248923 i must tell you that i am deeply troubled by a notion i see developing in russia and that is a notion that russia somehow has a say or some control over countries outside of its borders

4248927 theres a reason it didnt mention the carbon tax policy
4248928 thats because its a bad policy for atlantic canada it would hurt families here it would hurt industries here and thats why theyre not talking about it
4248929 we are going to make sure that atlantic canadians are not tricked into voting for a carbon tax that would damage the region
4248930 i think if the canadian public really knew the extent of harm that asbestos has caused i think there would be an outrage over what the federal government is doing
4248931 i cannot describe to you the public health epidemic that unfolded before us and is still happening
4248932 were probably the only industrialized country not tracking the extent of the disease and its impact on our society
4248933 certainly the government will not support anything that may be viewed as critical of asbestos when theyre the chief cheerleaders for the asbestos industry

4248984 there could be a dramatic political realignment in the northeast if republicans dont head it off right now
4248985 the exclamation point on this years congressional elections is that republicans dont have a competitive candidate on staten island
4248986 the staten island republican party has been renowned for producing powerful politicians for years for decades
4248987 the fact of the matter is four days after he sent me the letter saying we should engage in some debates he got a hand delivered letter from us saying absolutely
4248988 absolutely received a letter from the sweetland campaign back in july and since then weve been waiting for a conversation to have to talk about debates
4248989 theyre critical to this race and we want to have them and we want to have the conversation so people can hear where the candidates stand on the issues
4248990 i dont know what kind of political ploy dan wants to play but you know lets go
4248991 it has to be dealt with because it hurts business it hurts people and it hurts the business that these companies are doing
4248992 small business cant absorb the rising costs as well as big business can

4248994 and half of my friends are guys its kind of embarrassing because youre out with a group of friends and the next day it says youre dating one of them and lap dancing too
4248995 i just love it its so gossipy and superficial its amazing
4248996 i probably wouldnt want to see myself on there because it would ruin it for me
4248997 i like watching other people get gossiped about it makes me feel better
4248998 the whole world knows about my love life or lack thereof
4248999 its exciting to be part of a club that is known for its homegrown stars
4249000 it gives me a lot of confidence that they want me and its comforting to know im with them
4249001 im going to try to skim my pitches down from the five i threw in college to three
4249002 id rather have three excellent pitches versus five good ones so ill be working on my fastball slider and spit finger pitch that i can throw as a changeup
4249003 i slipped that far because i made it clear i was going to college
4249004 they made me a handsome offer but it was a no brainer to go to college at that point im glad i made the decision i did then because i had a great experience at michigan
4249005 but its really worked out well for me because im in a great situation with a club like the indians that really wanted me
4249006 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4249007 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4249008 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces
4249009 and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4249010 by identifying problems early i hope our findings will guide policy makers and health care professions to design interventions to support service members and their families

4249018 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
4249019 so if he obama were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states what im concerned about is can he bring me the electoral votes of the state of virginia

4249022 good morning folks were on our way to san francisco we expect to arrive at 11 45 am we expect a smooth trip you can expect your luggage on carousel c
4249023 were very happy to be heeere when we spoke laaast you said that you were experiencing increasing overseas comptetitionnnnn and were confident that we can heeelp youuu and it will only cost one hundred thousand dollllars
4249024 there was a black ouout across eight states last niiight it was the worst power faiaiailure in american historyyyy the cause remains unknooownnnn
4249025 good morning folks i just want to tell you about our flight i think we are kind of going to san francisco today and hopefully well arrive at 11 45am and maybe youll sort of get your luggage on carousel c i hope
4249026 as a result this will help you grow your sales
4249027 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4249028 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4249029 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4249030 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4249031 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4249032 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4249033 i heard z yell some gibberish in a foreign language
4249034 it sounded like chinese or something i dont know what it was and then he was all over antonio
4249035 its a fun way to package and present our premiere week and make it uniquely abc as well
4249036 all networks should have constant concern even if there wasnt a strike about the fracturing and fragmenting of their audiences
4249037 but its particularly important after the interruptions of last season to try to start fresh and in effect hit reset
4249038 antagonistic degrading or demeaning conduct in the workplace that is directed at or about ones religious faith or ancestry can be discriminatory and can amount to an unlawful hostile environment
4249039 i felt we had a great practice today an extension of what we had yesterday we got a chance to evaluate a lot of our people we got a chance to evaluate them under different conditions and we are very pleased
4249040 usually the second day is always that way it was the same way last year ive probably practiced with a different team seven or eight times since ive been in the national football league and it never changes that second day is usually a bit more competitive and we had some great work
4249041 zach is a great football player i think we all know zach thomas he practices at a certain level and thats why he plays at a certain level every time he hits that football field hes an experienced pro a guy i have always admired and he had a good practice today
4249042 i think both of those guys marshall and cowboys cb adam jones are just having fun there is a lot of respect level there by both guys just going out and competing brandon has a hard time staying quiet though after someone takes a shot at him i do know that
4249043 it wasnt a fight thats was just a little pushing that happens all the time but they kept their composure and they didnt swing thats what you want tempers are going to flare up a little bit thats the nature of this profession but they were professional enough to back off and players laugh at it and smile thats part of practicing against another team but there were no swings and thats what i appreciated two teams acted in a professional manner and hopefully we will have another good practice this afternoon
4249044 they get a chance to see what we are doing and we get a chance to see what they are doing there isnt a gameplan involved but you still want to go out and do a good job you still want to evaluate players as well if we were playing them in a regular season game obviously we wouldnt be practicing against them but thats not they key at this time of year its to try to find your best 53 man squad and also put your system in against other people i think we have had a productive day and a half
4249045 i cant tell you if hes going to play on saturday but its not serious
4249046 i think its a lot different romo was in a backup role i believe for four years if im not mistaken hes a student of the game when you run the scout team or if you are on a team as a quarterback and you have four years looking at different defenses its a little easier to go behind that center and read defenses jay is a little bit different he wasnt thrown in the fire right away in the first year it was a growing experience but there are a little bit more growing pains the quicker you get in romo is reading coverages unbelievably i admire how quickly he reads coverages and gets the ball to the right spot he is going to have a heck of a year you could see it out here today and yesterday
4249047 i see a difference just watching romo play last year he plays with a lot of confidence he knows where the ball is going and if something breaks down he has the ability to make a play on his own he can throw the ball at all different angles and he is a heck of a weapon
4249048 as a team we had a little drop off but you know thats part of playing in the national football league we just got to be more consistent
4249049 basically i said yesterday that 21 is no champ bailey i thought about it for a moment today that since hes changed his name back to adam hes not even pac man hes not even as good as pac man used to be but its all in fun i explained to him that he needed to spice it up because im winning right now
4249050 im aiming for perfection and today i had a little drop off i had a few dropped balls and thats not like me i was kind of upset with myself im always trying to have a pro bowl day every day and today is not one of those days
4249051 yesterday was a little buddy buddy system going on but today was more intense and more physical we got after it today and it was pretty even
4249052 well when you see peyton manning come out and he sees different coverages whether its press or off coverage he changes it up as a defensive back in the nfl you make your money doing press coverage so i said lets go deep we went deep we went 100 percent going deep against pac man jones i mean adam sorry and we won
4249053 its exciting to be able to go against someone else and to be able to go out and compete against another team you got to motivate yourself a little more when you wake up every day going against the same guy today felt like game day a little bit
4249054 definitely when you are going against other guys guys that you are not friends with sometimes tempers flare
4249055 i really cant say what happened i guess two guys got into it a little extra at the end of the play once that happens your friends come and their friends come and pile on just grabbing pushing and tugging away
4249056 i guess yesterday people were feeling each other out we felt that we had the upper hand early in the morning yesterday and we knew they were going to come out with a higher intensity level and they did that we all came out and practiced hard today
4249057 definitely we do that with our own team sometimes when we go against our own team the defense will win and the offense will come out extra motivated because the coaches in the meetings are yelling at you and things like that it makes us want to come out and give that extra effort the next practice
4249058 its kind of hard to tell i am not a db so i am not staring at the quarterback most of the time most of the time i am on man coverage on somebody so i really cant tell you
4249059 he is a very strong runner his speed is a little bit deceptive he is a lot faster than people give him credit for he runs well inside the tackles and outside
4249060 i am just happy to be out there im playing will some downs and mike on others once you start to play linebacker it is really not that big of a difference
4249061 i think the scheme that we have is better and the guys that we have our inside scheme i think is a lot better than what we had last year with the players you can have the best scheme in the world but if you dont have the talent it is not going to mean anything
4249062 i usually wear shoes with at least three to four inch heels
4249063 my father my brother and all the men in my family are over 6 feet so that is what i am used to
4249064 i am short and i am looking for a man to father my children and i dont want to have short children
4249065 i just feel safer when i walk down the street with a man who is much taller than me
4249066 i am only attracted to tall men i just cant help it
4249067 you realize that if you are talking about growing old with a man most people shrink a couple of inches as they hit old age
4249068 well if hes going to shrink all the more reason to only meet someone very tall
4249069 we welcome the unexpected change recognizing that this is a case of forced disappearance and not just a kidnapping
4249070 i have seen a school safety agent handcuff one of my friends and punch her in the face
4249071 what used to be a walk to the principals office has now become a walk to your local precinct
4249072 the information can be analyzed to determine is there racism going on is there sexism going on is it because any one student who has special needs
4249073 its very difficult to do your job under these kinds of pressures

4249085 jugar con el sevilla o c diz y bilbao son buenas mediciones
4249086 en estos momentos contamos con un plantel muy parecido al de la temporada anterior con s lo tres incorporaciones hemos fichado tres jugadores como llorente ibagaza y edmilson que considero tres grandes refuerzos que nos pueden aportar muchas cosas
4249087 a medida que se acerca el inicio del campeonato es bueno
4249088 jugar con el sevilla o c diz y bilbao son buenas mediciones y aunque sabemos que son amistosos siempre es un trofeo que motiva y gusta ganar y por ello va a ser muy complicado
4249089 por lo que hemos podido seguir trabajando a un buen ritmo y a buen nivel

4249352 i think what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations

4249364 en materia de secuestro colombia es superada ampliamente por pa ses como m xico irak brasil venezuela y ecuador
4249365 en venezuela y ecuador ha aumentado el secuestro mientras en colombia ha disminuido bastante el n mero
4249366 la problem tica del secuestro en m xico est estrechamente relacionada con el surgimiento de la mafia de las drogas y la criminalidad organizada
4249367 es un efecto secundario de la alta tasa de criminalidad de las grandes ciudades
4249368 algunos pudieron haber muerto tenemos que cuidar que esos grupos de secuestrados no caigan en el olvido
4249369 vivi una verdadera ola de secuestros entre 1995 y 2001 que lleg a 3 706 casos en el 2000
4249370 los grupos armados ilegales recibieron desde 2002 menores ingresos provenientes del secuestro
4249371 no puede hablarse de que colombia exporte secuestros ya que en venezuela y ecuador hay bandas mixtas de colombianos con venezolanos y ecuatorianos
4249372 la criminalidad venezolana y ecuatoriana est copiando la pr ctica colombiana
4249373 ya no es la gran fuente de recursos sino que est afectando m s a la clase baja la guerrilla sigue secuestrando pero est bastante debilitada

4249379 especially when its not clear what theyre going to get for the money
4249380 i dont care as long as they get them fixed
4249381 id rather pay taxes for the roads and get them fixed right and im for the two billion dollar plan
4249382 if they want to go 10 or 12 years that would be great as long as you use materials that are going to stay

4249387 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4249389 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4249390 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4249391 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4249392 this is a creative way to help those teachers who are priced out of their school districts housing market to afford to move closer to their classrooms
4249393 when teachers have to drive an hour or more to and from work it has a negative effect on their school community rather than spending time on the freeway they could be spending more time with students and extra curricular activities the bill promotes local control and allows communities to decide if they want to take this step which could improve recruiting and retention of teachers
4249394 it would give us the ability to offer our employees a quality housing option close to where they work which would help us retain teachers and classified employees and the income would help us offset maintenance costs district wide which would enable us to focus more of our existing resources on teaching and learning
4249395 assembly bill 1112 would create an innovative initiative that supports childrens education by addressing teacher housing needs
4249396 the challenge facing our teachers and ultimately our children is the severe lack of affordable housing in the neighborhoods where our children reside due to the scarcity of available land the lack of affordable housing results in teachers needing to seek employment elsewhere thereby reducing the number of highly qualified teachers in our district this bill will assist in highly qualified teachers remaining in their neighborhood schools and the district would be able to recruit more highly qualified teachers to areas not previously considered affordable

4249399 i put our guys in a bad situation i really did a full padded day drill with no pads

4249415 emerson mccauley has always maintained that the third man and robert brown were participants in the homicide

4249417 there were no injuries it did not spread to any other buildings and the main production facility is still up and operating

4249431 these people are our neighbors they go to our churches
4249432 families are virtually stranded in their homes with no breadwinners and no means of support
4249433 culturally we are richer people because they are here the jobs that they have filled have helped all of us i think we can readily admit that
4249434 social service agencies step in to fill the gap and provide those needs while they wait to find out of theyll be deported or stay
4249435 we are legal people bilingual and with families its a little different than other churches but when other latino people are in trouble we want to help

4249704 your unauthorized use of american expressway a mark virtually identical to our clients american express mark is likely to cause consumers to be confused mistaken or deceived as to the source of origin of your services
4249705 please let me know if you didnt actually send this alleged c amp d wouldnt want your reputation tarnished if this idiotic c amp d was a joke
4249706 the shit its been so rough and so consistently uproarious up until that point that the cheat is excusable
4249707 wouldnt necessarily have prohibited them from killing their own dogs but it wouldnt have been done by gunshot
4249708 it would maybe have made it more likely that they surrendered the animals to a shelter nobody can possibly say this was an acceptable way of handling dogs with fleas
4249709 they were old and we were hearing that they dont want kennels anymore
4249710 the best thing to do was get rid of them
4249711 that someone would shoot 70 dogs rather than spend money to do a vet check is extremely problematic
4249712 every humane society in the state would have taken those dogs
4249713 what awesome thing will i set my sights on next

4249716 the beacon program sent information regarding specific user transactions on facebook beacon activated affiliates websites to facebook regardless of whetever the user was a facebook member or not
4249717 i have always said that being pro choice is a mainstream conservative value
4249718 it is unfortunate that sen mccain does not share the view of many mainstream republicans that privacy and freedom from government interference in personal decisions is a core value
4249719 this is one of the clearest differences between sen obama and sen john mccain and it is a difference that matters to voters including pro choice independent and republican women
4249720 the concept of operation immortality is much more than a theme to an online game the earths population needs to quickly adjust our behavior regarding global warming or else fiction quickly becomes our new reality when we learned that richard garriott will be conducting environmental research while in space the stars all aligned to support him
4249721 planet make over is about saving the planet the message is serious but the process can and should be fun
4249722 i know first hand the power that music has to unite people and i know that global warming poses a serious and pending threat to humanity
4249723 the first step is to come together and collectively change our daily habits or operation immortality becomes way too real this is the serious part the fun part is involving musicians their dna schematics of fender guitars and a record of planet strategy as part of operation immortality to set an historical benchmark of the moment the planet took action to reverse this threat to humanity
4249724 i am very excited to have rock greats such as johnson pike and bruton bringing their message to save the earth from environmental catastrophe
4249725 my current gaming project tabula rasa starts with the earth being devastated by hostile aliens however regardless of how humanity faces its doom planet make over and operation immortality are working for the same result humanitys survival
4249726 youd ask him what key he wanted to play a song in and hed say it doesnt matter
4249727 i thought he was the bill evans of the guitar
4249728 well miss his wit his wisdom and his incredible fluency on guitar
4249729 he was one of a kind and an immense talent

4249732 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is pedaling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4249733 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4249734 john mccain the american president americans have been waiting for
4249735 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4249736 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4249737 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4249738 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4249739 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy
4249740 we are definitely hoping to be able to push this to practical applications into the clinic this is one step forward
4249741 but it will still take time to truly prove the efficacy and the safety

4249743 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4249744 this is something that we talked about in the early part of the summer we knew that it was just a matter of time before we got it done
4249745 i love being a part of this organization and the direction that the team is heading i am extremely happy to be a part of it moving forward
4249746 his velocity isnt the same hes not quite back to where he was a couple of years ago but with what he has he is probably better than a lot of guys he is a force on the mound
4249747 thats what we set out to do ever since spring
4249748 i can talk about the starting rotation every time we cross the line we want to do our best maybe half of the team dont have that mentality
4249749 the angels usually find a way to win and thats what we need to do not just be satisfied to play with teams of that caliber
4249750 thats what interim manager jim rigglemans been stressing to us every game that were capable of being a really good team
4249751 the initiative only amounted to throwing bodies at a problem with no plan and no strategy
4249752 my sense is nobody has any idea where he is
4249753 im not sure hes in the tribal areas if hes anywhere in pakistan he has disappeared into a city
4249754 it is somewhat surprising that it has not done so yet
4249755 the reason we didnt get bin laden so far is that weve tried to do it on the cheap
4249756 we are spread very thin we are more and more contracting with people who are former agency people and people who have never had any relationship with the agency
4249757 its experienced people you dont build up that kind of experience overnight
4249758 they dont go to peshawar they find a local taxi driver and say go up to waziristan and report back they dont have a network
4249759 they want to keep him alive they want to keep a symbolic figure there it is not possible for them not to find him
4249760 there was no time in the desperation to get people to go to these places to be choosy
4249761 as long as the militants were attacking across the border they didnt give a damn
4249762 you cannot be sure they all were cia spies but the deaths send a powerful message about who is in charge within the tribal areas
4249763 at a minimum we can expect that he is providing strategic guidance to the associated movement
4249764 i cant imagine one single thing we could to that would be more important
4249765 im going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by 20
4249766 i only saved a dollar too its unfair that he got ten times more than i
4249767 why should he get 10 back when i got only two the wealthy get all the breaks
4249768 we didnt get anything at all the system exploits the poor
4249769 we knew it was just a matter of time before we got it done
4249770 i love being part of this organization and the direction that the team is heading
4249771 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4249772 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
4249773 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
4249774 at least one from each major family in the series
4249775 there are six long months of work in this research
4249776 some will be against this and some will be for it
4249777 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
4249778 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
4249779 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
4249780 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
4249781 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4249782 fairly new and untested in high volumes outside a lab setting

4249786 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
4249787 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived
4249788 we can today confirm that we have advised the metropolitan police service that the actor christian bale should not face any charges following an incident which occurred in relation to his mother and sister at the dorchester hotel on 21 july this year
4249789 we were having a hard discussion about whether we could continue together under one roof when the conversation turned to the kids he said if you take the kids i will kill you he and i have discussed this horrible incident and he says it was just his australian manner and some humour however the mood and tone was all serious and i was devastated
4249790 throughout 2006 and 2007 i observed and objected to him offering our children beer from beer bottles and ice from scotch glasses
4249791 throughout the marriage i have protested his objections to things like the kids brushing their teeth going to the pediatrician for check ups having innoculations using sun block keeping a schedule and car seats fitting securely
4249792 she is a very competitive person this is the cause of her success on the tennis court

4249797 the mod examines reports solely to establish whether uk airspace may have been compromised by hostile or unauthorised military activity
4249798 it was a very unfortunate incident involving a lie one of the press folks told to undermine a story i had written i didnt get an apology from the original source but the campaign manager maggie williams offered a very kind one and my bosses here at
4249799 the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to identify through whatever channel or medium information well fitted to information needs leading to wise and ethical use of information in society
4249800 it is time for syrian tutelage to end once and for all
4249801 both countries should pledge not to interfere in each others domestic affairs
4249802 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty
4249803 i hope no one will try to obstruct these endeavors
4249804 put the relationship on a more equitable basis syria has always been a senior partner

4249808 the majority of people living in xinjiang support national unification and are opposed to terrorism extremists and separatists
4249809 there is extremist propaganda that is radicalizing a segment of the population but government action itself has hastened the pace of radicalization
4249810 although uighur militant groups in xinjiang were thoroughly crushed in the 1990s it seems that a new generation of militants has stepped up to take their place
4249811 the attackers are young and apparently even included two women in kuqa i believe a first in the recent history of violent militancy in the region
4249812 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4249813 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4249814 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4249815 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4249816 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4249817 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4249818 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4249819 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4249820 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4249821 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4249822 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4249823 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4249824 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4249825 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4249826 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4249827 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4249828 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4249829 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4249830 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4249831 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out
4249832 thinking back i would have pushed to be a psychologist if for no other reason than to understand myself better
4249833 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4249834 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4249835 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero

4249838 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4249839 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4249840 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4249841 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4249842 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4249843 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4249844 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4249845 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4249846 we have no beds six of us are sleeping on the floor we dont have anything left
4249847 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
4249848 we by which i mean the great bulk of us are willing to impose on ourselves for the purpose

4249866 are both committed to winning back the white house and to ensuring that the voices of all 35 million people who participated in this historic primary election are respected and heard in denver
4249867 to honor and celebrate these voices and votes both senator obamas and senator clintons names will be placed in nomination
4249868 this wasnt something she was itching for looking for but so many of her supporters said it was important to them and the obama people got how important it was to smooth over any tensions and that it was the right thing to do
4249869 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4249870 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4249871 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
4249872 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
4249873 we are absolutely committed to electing barack obama and this is the best way to do it so let people have their moment
4249874 sen clinton will assure that nothing will occur that will hinder sen obama s chances but even more will help him by when it comes time for her vote by voting for him and by moving at the convention to nominate sen obama by acclamation
