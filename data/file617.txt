6170000 dini says you were embroidering satanic messages in your muffler
6170001 i have no interest in satan maybe dini is the one having some setback
6170002 im going to recommend we increase your dosage again until you stabilize lets schedule a further two weeks of observation shall we
6170003 i do not think im needing the pills dr gershwin
6170004 well im going to stick with my own assessment for the time being lets just see how things go alright we can discuss any concerns you might be having at group
6170005 oh wait dont tell me its one of those um what do you call them
6170006 yeah but how am i supposed to get to my sleeping spot
6170007 i left you a tunnel see yes its for the crawling
6170008 this reminds me of that thing people do in water
6170009 yes swimming i like girls in bathing suits at the sandy part near er a wet hole
6170010 if i make the web tighter i can hear more here you will help me
6170011 i need two mens so we can pull at the same time
6170012 a single sound just perfect that will jiggle the pieces into place
6170013 of all the sounds in the world there is one that is shaped and sequenced just right yes
6170014 the sound is simply a signature it is the name of the event the physical name of the unlocking and what is a name it is a label that encodes anchors for a greater body of data yes it is shorthand it is a marker for a class of classes an attractor for a set of subsystems a flag to mark a country of informations
6170015 i dont know what any of that is supposed to mean
6170016 that a name is a kind of reductive algorithm whose form implies more we keep rules yes to extract what is more and fit it to context in the best of all systems the rules are encoded in the key encrypted by the key and are in fact one in the same with the key
6170017 the name it is a fold in the data telling us there are additional vectors of informations we cannot be directly sampling like your brain my friend it cannot store every thing you need to know without compression it uses sets and sets of sets each encapsulated by a label a distinct pattern for firing the neurones to synthesize the informations we can manipulate the symbols instead of the databases themselfs this is why mens can think as they do so quickly so broadly so insightful
6170018 this is broken in your brain but it is not broken in the world
6170019 these walls these airs these molecules and atoms they are not the core no they are emergent things they are signatures they are lines of compression that imply the geography of microscopic dimensions can we detect them no not at energies found in a normal world can we manipulate them though
6170020 we look at a door at a lock we see four dimensions
6170021 but there are more we cannot touch them but we can touch the things that touch them
6170022 we can even excite them given the right combination of the frequencies we can trick the air itself into doing our bidding yes
6170023 the pattern is paramount patterns that rhyme are intechangeable like a skeleton key the universe does not know the difference
6170024 i dont know why i could never see it before really it is very simple really it is obvious
6170025 the question is is amplification symmetrical will the wave still rhyme with itself when it has become small can we preserve these critical harmonic resonances as we are attenuating the signal to the proper sub microscopic scale
6170026 no it worked fine the bolt retracted but the door still will not open
6170027 sometimes youve just got to smack the living shit out of it
6170028 oh not me i dont mind it here my brothers coming to visit me tomorrow hell bring um baklava yes baklava i love baklava
6170029 good uh whats that thing that makes everything go the way youd hoped
6170030 weve lost contact sir all channels are drowned in noise
6170031 you must listen to me drago quickly now theres a car waiting for you in the alley yes
6170032 drago my name is bahram the shah is my father weve met before
6170033 yes now in the car lets not dally people are dying and the night is still young worse things will happen if we dont move along
6170034 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
6170035 devoted many hours to analyzing and improving the body structure safety belts and air bags of escape and mariner for better performance in front and side impact crashes

6170046 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
6170047 baa has argued that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist
6170048 we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
6170049 we fear the proposals put forward by the competition commission will lead to greater fragmentation and undermine a coherent and strategic approach to service delivery
6170050 in reality many of the travelling public have little choice as to the airports they are served by and can use we question the principle of market based solutions in this context
6170051 we are very pleased that the competition commission has recognised what is a fundamental problem for uk airports
6170052 we are not pulling out and pulling back troops behind this administrative border into the territory of south ossetia
6170053 agreed that russia must honor its commitment to withdraw its troops from georgia and to return to the status quo before the hostilities began on august the 6th
6170054 south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6170055 over the last seven days theyve promised three times to leave but theyve yet to fulfill their promises

6170070 why has dressage which is essentially dancing horses been in the olympics since 1912 the horse is the only athlete in that event even ballroom dancing which once applied for olympic status and was turned down requires more athleticism than a dressage rider
6170071 we can do no great things only small things with great love
6170072 most of us have no idea where were going most of the time perfect celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
6170073 over the course of our lifetime god ordained passions tend to get buried beneath day to day responsibilities

6170084 we can do no great things only small things with great love
6170085 instead of asking yourself whether you believe or not ask yourself whether you have this day done one thing because he said do it or once abstained because he said do not do it it is simply absurd to say you believe or even want to believe in him if you do not do anything he tells you

6170211 this report could hold a few surprises in terms of the number of cattle that were actually put into feedlots last month because of low priced corn
6170212 plus we already had a pool of cattle already on pastures when corn prices were much higher
6170213 with very slow placements this spring weve delayed the movement of these cattle into feedlots
6170214 they cattle stayed in pastures and kept eating so theyve been growing
6170215 this therefore suggests that producers were not particularly aggressive in moving cattle last month
6170216 we ultimately forecast a 3 annual increase for the report

6170219 and when these commodity prices come back down then were going to see some real challenges for the next six to seven months these farmers should be in good shape if they get a good crop and have a contract but you start looking at a longer term and there is reason to be concerned
6170220 if corn sells for 5 a bushel a farmer would need a yield of at least 110 bushels per acre to break even on inputs alone that doesnt cover land salaries or machinery costs
6170221 the cow calf operators have been hit the hardest because theyve also seen a decrease in revenue
6170222 a common misperception is that farmers can simply pass on increases in production costs through the supply chain to the consumer
6170223 in commodity markets farmers are price takers and individual farmers have almost no control over the prices they receive for commodities in the long run if profits are low then producers will decrease production thereby reducing supply and increasing price
6170224 a lot of the inputs that they use not just with fuel but with pesticides plastic and plasticulture which is used for a lot of our annual vegetables are all substantially driven by petroleum costs
6170225 these are highly perishable products that are shipped by refrigerated truck theres a cold chain that typically has to be preserved from farm gate to the supermarket or restaurant and the energy costs associated with that have pushed the cost of that whole value delivery system way up

6170229 it was more like the spanish inquisition or the salem witch trials than a reasoned hearing by the so called highest court in the land
6170230 the whole purpose was to discredit new zealand first and marginalise winston peters
6170231 he checked his records yesterday and found this was indeed the case
6170232 it is only a matter of time before the growing army of unemployed and underemployed turns from restless to violent
6170233 about 80 percent of the pacifics population growth is found in the low growth group of islands where employment is rare and living standards are not rising
6170234 but even high guest worker numbers of 50 000 a year for australia and 25 000 for new zealand would not help the employment problems of papua new guinea fiji and the solomon islands
6170235 the pacific can only avoid looming economic social and political crises if its large economies dramatically reform their policies to encourage substantial employment creating growth
6170236 more than two million men four out of five are unemployed in towns or underemployed in villages
6170237 er is steeds minder plaats voor afwijkende meningen en mediavrijheid
6170238 nu vrezen de bloggers betrokken te raken in rechtszaken die kunnen uitlopen op zware schadevergoedingen wegens smaad of het aanzetten tot onrust
6170239 het is wel zonneklaar dat een onmiddellijke stop van het gebruik van rioolwater de voedselbevoorrading op veel plaatsen in elkaar zou doen stuiken aangezien bijna driekwart van de steden minstens een deel van hun groenten in en rond de stad halen en daar wordt afvalwater gebruikt
6170240 maybe youve heard about the guy whose life goal was to climb a certain mountain when he finally reached the top he was terribly disappointed there was nowhere else for him to go and something was still missing in his life its like the pro football player who gets depressed
6170241 because we are created in gods image with spiritual intellectual creative moral and relational capacities we will never be satisfies with a superficial mindless culture or religion the result is that religious and irreligious people alike are experiencing deep spiritual hunger
6170242 you have made us for yourself and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you
6170243 these are the 750 people that dont like it and all we ask as minorities is to get the mural modified
6170244 those men were barefoot rowing a boat with white men on it if i put something on my barber shop downtown and it was offensive to whites there would be someway that this city would make me remove it
6170245 they will certainly be given consideration and hopefully in the near future there will be more dialogue if need be
6170246 were going to be at the next city council meeting and were going to make sure that were visible and were going to make sure that something is changed
6170247 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6170248 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6170249 just pricing the distributional effects of congestion pricing and sales taxes
6170250 at a time when public officials in los angeles and other cities are considering congestion tolls and sales tax increases for transportation
6170251 asking drivers to pay for road use ignites debates over fairness but the debate often fails to address the larger question of how funding for transportation projects is actually being distributed throughout the community
6170252 freeways are a premium transport service and they should be priced accordingly the study shows that if we are prudent we can do that while being sensitive to the circumstances of low income drivers
6170253 while regular users can pay dearly for the right to bypass 9 miles of bumper to bumper traffic about 700 a year for heavy users and 300 a year for moderate users all such payments are voluntary because traveling in the congested free lanes is always an option
6170254 are tolls regressive according to this and many previous analyses yes but for transport policy whether tolls are regressive fails to fully address the justice and fairness issues that arise in financing road use
6170255 using sales taxes to fund roadways creates substantial savings to drivers by shifting some of the costs of driving from drivers to consumers at large and in the process disproportionately favors the more affluent at the expense of the impoverished
6170256 we were able to show that microscale and even nanoscale indentations were picked up and reproduced by the plastic surface the idea was then born that if you could somehow engineer those surface to have the same sort of hooks and eyes as velcro it would be an ideal way of bonding surface together
6170257 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6170258 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
6170259 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6170260 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
6170261 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
6170262 weve got a nucleus in place to do good things it all just comes down to how things work out in negotiations

6170280 norway has noted that russia has decided for the time being to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6170281 nato has not received any notification from the russians saying they are going to cut military cooperation activities
6170282 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6170283 we must be very clear that our campaign has not violated any campaign rules and have received no notice to that effect
6170284 clearly the letter of the law would say that if you are an independent candidate you can only accept 1 000 per election
6170285 when we accepted the contributions and pledges for our campaign i was running in the progressive primary
6170286 there was no violation of any law the law says nothing about what happens if you change that party affiliation
6170287 one thing that isnt clear is that you cant find the law where they say it is written

6170293 i had parallel parked on main street in downtown lima i had to let a couple of cars pass before i could open the door and step out into the street
6170294 i looked down to see that i was standing there in my underpants my skirt on the street behind me im sure my face was red
6170295 i thought my dress must be even more attractive than id thought
6170296 but as i stepped outside i felt a draft from behind
6170297 too late to sew no safety pins with me what could i do
6170298 i looked at the check in table and saw the adhesive name badges luckily we had extra blank ones and i used them to fasten my drooping hem back in place just seconds before people began to arrive
6170299 we had gone to kettering rec pool with my 4 year old grandson who was in a grouchy mood
6170300 as grandma i tried to cheer him up by standing under a bucket of water which fills up and then dumps out i thought he would laugh when the water would spill down all over my head instead i shocked all the pool goers and myself when the water went down the front of my one piece suit and pulled it down to my ankles
6170301 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6170302 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6170309 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6170310 the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory and the u s installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement
6170311 i was very disappointed the event was cancelled as a fighter you like to have a goal a date and an opponent in mind to bring even more focus to your training but once that goal is removed it can be difficult sometimes to find the motivation as you did before
6170312 training is very hard as always but right now i am just going through the motions
6170313 i hope too that we myself management and paul get to fight on oct 4 we publicly call out jake shields we know as no 5 in the world jake may see no point to this but he is the champion he must defend the u s fans think its gonna be such a walkover for jake well lets see right easy pay day jake lets go
6170314 three reasons mainly first i know a lot of the elitexc fans think this is one of the only fights that makes sense as i am one of only a few elitexc fighters that will make for an exciting and challenging match with jake second the sept 20 show got cancelled so i thought id spit my dummy out and try and push to get on the big cbs show finally i want to be champion
6170315 his wrestling and submissions are great but his striking and stand up isnt quite so great
6170316 but he also seems to be a fighter with a point to prove so maybe he trains really hard and tries to stand up with me who knows
6170317 i hope he takes the fight hes the champion he must fight all challengers

6170322 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6170323 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6170324 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6170325 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6170377 our goal is to aggregate a very large multimillion person audience across a number of devices with our standard platforms so we can start to address the audience in a unified consistent way and ultimately create a liquid advertising market
6170378 im quite sure there are going to be products on this

6170386 fixed an issue that could allow cross site scripting as reported by chris weber of casaba security details will be disclosed at a later date
6170387 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
6170388 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
6170389 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage
6170390 you pay x dollars per session and you can only use it at a few locations
6170391 the explosion of free sites is really driving the market
6170392 wi fi grows like a weed it shows up in areas you never expect
6170393 operators have started bundling hotspot access with other services such as fixed and mobile broadband
6170394 this way consumers can access hotspots without paying a separate fee and operators can generate some access revenue by bundling the cost of the service into a bigger service package that consumers are willing to purchase
6170395 hotspot owners are still charging if they control a prime location like airports where there is no alternative
6170396 it is hard for them to just walk away from that revenue stream even if it will decline
6170397 the u s market is more competitive with free sites along with proliferation of cellular data and wimax rollouts
6170398 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal
6170399 a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6170400 today items paid with check or money order are 80 more likely to result in an item not received than those paid with credit card or
6170401 also buyers who pay with check or money order are 50 more likely to leave negative feedback than those who pay with electronic methods so starting in late october 2008 we are moving to 100 electronic payments credit cards propay or paypal
6170402 the main challenge ebay faces is that it is becoming easier and easier to find things to buy on the web simply by searching for what you want on google during the early days of the web people needed a few big e commerce sites they could trust and that could organize everything that was for sale online that need was filled by amazon and ebay
6170403 partly that is because ebay has done such a good job creating a semi professional class of online sellers that it is harder and harder to actually find bargains there
6170404 it doesnt make any sense they didnt fight they werent at odds they didnt have any financial problems

6170417 following an initiative by georgian citizens who immigrated to israel and became businesspeople
6170418 the fact that georgias defense minister davit kezerashvili is a former israeli who is fluent in hebrew contributed to this cooperation
6170419 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
6170420 the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
6170421 and with his help israels defense industries managed to sell to georgia drones automatic turrets for armored vehicles antiaircraft systems communication systems shells and rockets
6170422 israel has reportedly helped upgrade soviet designed su 25 ground attack jets assembled in georgia and former israeli generals serve as advisers to the georgian military
6170423 israel arms sales to georgia over the last decade have been estimated at some 300 million to 500 million

6170440 his goldsmiths admission that he read the second still secret memo that detailed specific interrogation techniques being used by the cia makes it flatly impossible that he did not know or suspect what was going on when he wrote the transfer memo
6170441 was used to facilitate the ghost detainee program in which various prisoners were hidden from the international red cross so that nobody would learn that they were prisoners
6170442 and contrary to the geneva conventions i gather their status health and whereabouts were not disclosed to their families
6170443 by not formally accusing them in any judicial way we could according to goldsmith transfer them out of iraq because formally they were not yet accused persons although in fact our government had already accused and convicted them every way but sideways this is true dissembling this is true reliance on minimal form over gigantic substance and this is exactly what jack goldsmith did in his memo of march 19 2004
6170444 until the time came to garner publicity in september 2007 for his new book
6170445 goldsmith was an enabler of evil including evil and crime justified by the tortured rationalizations of lawyers who set out to provide legal cover for torture for cruelly inhuman conduct and other horrors
6170446 whether lawyers in order to justify and provide a basis for supporting vicious and illegal actions of the government are free to assert the most outlandish arguments in favor of these actions are free to invent astonishing even evil arguments in favor of the positions are free to facilitate the governments evil actions and not to counsel against the positions even though the positions and actions are in violation of domestic criminal laws in violation of international law contrary to the american constitutional system and taken without consideration of the traditions and values of this country
6170447 gravely illegal conduct in this way would be subject to disbarment subject to criminal prosecution and disqualified from being on any respectable law school faculty
6170448 an enemy of the people the unending battle against conventional wisdom
6170449 usually you can see if its a home run because the ball gets smaller and that one started to get smaller real quick
6170450 you dont want to get a leadoff double i ended up getting a good grip on the ball and putting a good throw on the ball and just kind of got lucky
6170451 i was just really focused on executing my pitches after that first inning
6170452 its good to have a packed crowd thats cheering like that it definitely makes you more amped up
6170453 this week can make you or break you and if it makes you youve still got another week to make you or break you
6170454 it doesnt get any easier youve got to play well you cant afford to get swept youve got to win some series otherwise you can start thinking about next year
6170455 i believe we are coming to market with a very powerful and impressive projector duo for our first product offerings

6170463 ich bin geschockt ich bin regelrecht geschockt ich bin so lange hinter dem weltrekord hergejagt
6170464 das ist eines der gr ten talent das ich jemals gesehen habe
6170465 das wrack war total verkohlt und voller leichen da sah nichts mehr wie ein flugzeug aus
6170466 saldr a la venta el 15 de octubre a un precio de 199
6170467 es bricht jetzt keine welt zusammen es ist nicht so schlimm wie das qualifikations aus bei der wm 2005 in helsinki irgendwie hat sich das alles in der saison schon angedeutet
6170468 an den nerven lag es nicht ich hatte technische probleme
6170469 ich hatte ja schon vor olympia gesagt dass nicht auszuschlie en ist dass wir wie in athen nur zwei medaillen holen zumindest dieses ergebnis ist noch m glich
6170470 vor einem jahr habe man bettys hammer von osaka gefeiert
6170471 we made it through the bursting of the internet bubble and now the bursting of the real estate bubble
6170472 since credit card debt has been growing much faster than the economy more than 8 in last years third and fourth quarters and over 7 in may the most recent month reported people are apparently using it as a substitute for income thus for the past year or so we have still maintained the standard of living illusion
6170473 sustainable increases in living standards have to be earned not borrowed and that means performing ever higher value work that cant be outsourced we havent been meeting that challenge very well doing so will probably require much more and better education for millions of americans which takes time and money the result may feel like deprivation but i dont see it that way who knows we might even find that living within our means and saving a little money actually isnt so bad
6170474 at the risk of heresy let it be said that setting up the two presidential candidates for religious interrogation by an evangelical minister no matter how beloved is supremely wrong it is also un american for the past several days since mega pastor rick warren interviewed barack obama and john mccain at his saddleback church most political debate has focused on who won the winner of course was warren who has managed to position himself as political arbiter in a nation founded on the separation of church and state the loser was america his format and questions were interesting and the answers more revealing than the usual debate menu provides but does it not seem just a little bit odd to have mccain and obama chatting individually with a preacher in a public forum about their positions on evil and their relationship with jesus christ
6170475 suddenly and without warning put two of his fingers inside her vagina
6170476 norway has noted that russia has decided for the time being to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6170477 nato has not received any notification from the russians saying they are going to cut military cooperation activities
6170478 temporary decisions are being taken on current cooperation and not about cooperation in general
6170479 military naval exercises in the far east the mediterranean in the baltic
6170480 this is not going to happen if afghanistan is the new vietnam for the americans then it will be a problem for russia itself we are not interested in the alliances failure in afghanistan
6170481 we wish to continue the cooperation with russia as far as possible but now the conflict with russia has escalated further its a quite demanding security policy landscape thats developing
6170482 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6170483 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6170484 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6170485 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6170486 would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future
6170487 we asked them what security needs they had and they were quite specific and quite defined
6170488 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6170489 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6170490 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6170491 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6170492 when i am in beijing i will make clear to president hu and premier wen that respect for human rights matters to us every year not only the year of the olympics
6170493 i am looking forward to constructive discussion of these issues with the chinese leadership during my visit to beijing
6170494 i take a group of inner city kids from oakland and take them on a college tour i would say it is mainly just to put them in the environment of seeing that next level of education
6170495 all the kids we take have gpas that can get them into the schools they are in the inner city and arent as privileged as other students who can take trips across the country at any time this is a way for me to get them out there and show them some different things besides what is just in the bay area
6170496 you hear about places on the east coast like harvard but a lot of people never have a chance in their whole life to see these places everyone is very enthusiastic and elated to see the new places its really cool
6170497 the success percentages are great all the kids who graduated have gone on to secondary education
6170498 they havent necessarily chosen the schools we went to but theyve all gone on to college and are pursuing degrees
6170499 its important to share the wealth of knowledge with other people its important for the youth to see that education is cool and that it is okay to go to college

6170509 even though weve seen a decline in our developer checks weve seen a steady enrollment increase

6170540 as long as the intervention does not entail a restructuring of the debt and ensures the viability of the enterprises debt cds spreads can tighten
6170541 higher spreads imply the expectation of greater defaults in the future as investors demand greater compensation for taking on credit risk

6170553 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6170554 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6170555 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6170556 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6170557 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6170558 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6170559 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6170560 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6170561 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6170562 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6170563 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6170564 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6170565 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6170566 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6170567 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6170568 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four

6170659 with respect to traffic its still dismal traffic is its consistent however it has not gotten any worse for the last three quarters so we feel as though weve stabilized but i dont want to give you the indication that that makes us feel good its as though we walked into the tar pits sunk up to our nose our feet are touching a ledge and we are not going down any further but that sure doesnt make us feel that comfortable but we are heartened that at least we are able to spook up the traffic that indicates that there are buyers out there waiting to be nudged it will take a general turn in confidence for the big nudge to occur but sooner or later it will occur
6170660 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6170661 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6170662 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits
6170663 with the end of moores law in sight mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after
6170664 we expect cellular based femtocells to have taken over the baton from uma and sip based wi fi solutions by 2013 seizing 62 of the market
6170665 although uma based wi fi solutions have seen early gains in greenfield markets these solutions have not proliferated much outside their current carrier footprints this can be attributed partly to the carriers desire to assess femtocell developments but also to lingering concerns regarding the concept of wi fi based fixed mobile convergence

6170700 because of the miniaturization of all kinds of spacecraft technology these nano and micro spacecraft are becoming more plausible and possible in many types of missions
6170701 its our dream and vision and hope that eventually we can place smaller spacecraft in all types of missions not just in near earth orbit
6170702 for those missions you can be at various distances from the sun and being able to change your thermal balance is a good thing
6170703 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
6170704 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft

6170782 the police officer looked to see who he was going to pick off
6170783 this finding is not surprising because when you think about it logically the reason were living longer is because were healthier and if were healthier at any given age then were less likely to be disabled
6170784 all the nursing homes will choke as more and more people spend much more time disabled
6170785 but in reality that hasnt really worked out to be the case
6170786 as i like to say the older you get the healthier youve been
6170787 so getting to 100 really is a survival phenomenon and people who get there necessarily have to have been disability free not only in their early 90s but pretty much for the vast majority of their lives
6170788 unexpressed concerns are challenging because they can lead to different expectations and understanding of the problems patients are concerned about and treatment recommendations that are poorly tailored to patient needs

6170804 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6170805 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6170806 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6170807 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society

6170811 the 1250 1260 level for the s amp p has to hold to keep this rally

6170821 while they continue to rely on a lot of their legacy products that have brought them to this point i think they are a little more intent and a lot more deliberate in moving into the wireless and handheld type world and bringing them another revenue stream
6170822 thats probably where a lot of the market is going a lot more complexity in portable type and handheld type products

6170859 we took a calculated risk by agreeing to purchase the law firms existing building but we lined up a highly qualified buyer before we inked the deal so we essentially double escrowed the property we are very aggressive and creative when it comes to leasing in this case it really paid off

6170861 epower gathers web responses that are generated from door hangers or direct mail

6170896 were not anti coal but we worry how much co2 from the plant will get into the air we think you can sequester it and we think you can offset it
6170897 while environmental defense fund has done great work in cutting carbon dioxide emissions at the plant by as much as 50 percent its not enough to assure viability of our climate
6170898 it is important for us to give something back to the communities that have given us so much eventually we would like to have similar events in the other cities and countries where we have been fortunate enough to do business

6170947 in the letter house republican leaders called on the democrats to join them in asking speaker nancy pelosi d calif to bring the house back into session to deal with the energy crisis and support the republican american energy act
6170948 the letter signed by the entire gop leadership team targets several democrats who have endorsed an expansion of domestic drilling
6170949 well soon find out whether democrats have found religion on drilling or if theyre merely doing an election year incantation
6170950 house republican leaders on wednesday sent a letter to 22 mostly freshman democrats accusing them of being hypocrites for publicly saying they support more american energy but then voting against gop energy proposals that seek more domestic drilling the letter signed by the entire gop leadership team targets several democrats who have endorsed an expansion of domestic drilling and who may be facing a tough re election in november it cites seven instances where each of the 22 democrats voted against republican energy proposals seeking offshore and arctic drilling
6170951 house republicans are stepping up the pressure on democrats they believe would support an expansion of domestic oil drilling sending a letter wednesday to 22 democrats who they hope will sign on to the gop plan to address high gas prices many of the democrats on the list like pennsylvania rep jason altmire and louisiana rep don cazayoux have publicly called for an expansion of domestic oil drilling

6170953 the democratic choice is between sticking with an anticarbon theology that opposes all new drilling or siding with american consumers who want more energy supplies so they dont have to pay 4 for gas and blow their family budget to keep the lights on
6170954 theyve done a really really good job in engaging the community and providing fantastic facilities and delivering it on time and generally making the olympic games back really where it should be as the greatest sporting event in the world every four years

6170956 absolutely this is a hell of a challenge to be able to deliver as well as the beijing olympics its a really grand affair
6170957 i think in britain we seem to be more concerned with the bottom line and that its not going to cost too much whereas i get the impression that in beijing money was no object i may be wrong
6170958 i think in the current environment everyone is more cautious about investments
6170959 if and when a compelling opportunity came up in the us local space where we think were well suited wed have a look at that but wed be looking for a majority interest and control role

6170999 the thoughts of all europeans are with those killed or injured in the tragic crash this afternoon
6171000 and with the grief and anguish of their loved ones there is nothing to express except sympathy and sorrow
6171001 por eso es muy importante que con sensibilidad con racionalidad con inteligencia podamos articular esfuerzos en todos los niveles nacionales provinciales municipales p blico y privado sabiendo que estamos todos en el mismo barco que el barco se llama la rep blica argentina y que tiene que llegar a buen puerto
6171002 la presidente lleva el buque argentina al garete y con rumbo colisi n
6171003 somos conscientes de que los recursos pesqueros son cada d a m s escasos y s lo pol ticas serias de manejo a medio y largo plazo combinadas con la b squeda del m ximo valor agregado son el camino para que nuestras empresas sean competitivas y como consecuencia los puestos de trabajo sean cada d a de m s calidad y perdurables en el tiempo
6171004 las recientes detenciones de diversos barcos pesqueros espa oles en aguas bajo la jurisdicci n de argentina afirma oceana no son m s que la punta del iceberg de unas actividades ilegales bien conocidas por el sector las autoridades pesqueras y la opini n p blica en general
6171005 la pesca ilegal debe ser considerada un asunto de estado y las autoridades gubernamentales y la justicia deben intervenir para poner fin a la misma
6171006 ustedes miren lo que yo hago no lo que yo digo
6171007 los tribunales espa oles podr n juzgar cualquier delito de pesca ilegal cometido por uno de sus ciudadanos en cualquier oc ano del mundo y con independencia de la bandera en la que se ampare para realizar sus actividades piratas lo que se pretende es defender al sector legal frente al que est ejerciendo una competencia desleal de forma il cita dr espe abu n

6171010 many scholars currently see northern central america and southern mexico mesoamerica as the most likely location of the book of mormon lands however such views are private and do not represent an official position of the church
6171011 in years past the convention welcomed various types of adult oriented panel discussions and seminars on such topics as 2257 web cam girls and various alternative sexual lifestyles
6171012 unfortunately due to a more conservative leadership at dragon con many of these bits of programming have gone by the wayside in recent years we intend to bring back such adult oriented fun in a private safe and sane environment
6171013 the con sluts party is a unique way to introduce our product to a targeted mainstream audience
6171014 we have a great group of sponsors for this years party who truly understand the potential for exposure in such a mainstream environment
6171015 these are all luminary companies with amazing products to offer and were honored to be able to pass their marketing message on to what we feel is an extremely relevant and interested community of adults
6171016 theyve been writing every movie down with descriptions writing down every piece of lingerie with descriptions every general novelty everything
6171017 i dont see how he can survive all this attention
6171018 very few people would want to shop for adult videos in a store thats got more than half a dozen uniformed police constantly roaming around looking over their shoulders considering how shy most people are about what porn they buy thats got to be about the worst thing that could happen
6171019 may run counter to recent decisions to significantly increase the numbers of radios issued to each unit
6171020 i dont want to make you any more uncomfortable but where did she touch you
6171021 im gonna have to ask you some questions about what happened yesterday
6171022 im not sure whether you know or not but you arent the first person that yossy assaulted
6171023 yossy has a disorder in which she cannot control her libido
6171024 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
6171025 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
6171026 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you
6171027 is barack obama exaggerating when he compares his campaign to the great progressive moments in us history
6171028 obama has run a brilliant campaign but not necessarily a great progressive one but thats not to say his campaign isnt significant or important
6171029 i am unapologetic i dont write about things unless theyre true im a grown ass woman and ive experienced grown ass things
6171030 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6171031 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6171032 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6171033 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6171034 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6171035 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6171036 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6171037 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6171038 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6171039 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6171040 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6171041 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6171044 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6171045 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6171046 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6171047 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6171048 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6171049 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6171050 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6171058 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6171059 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6171060 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6171061 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6171062 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6171063 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6171064 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6171065 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6171066 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6171067 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6171068 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6171069 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6171070 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6171071 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6171072 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6171073 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6171074 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6171075 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6171076 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6171077 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6171078 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6171079 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6171080 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6171081 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6171082 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6171083 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6171084 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6171085 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6171086 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6171087 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6171088 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6171089 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6171090 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6171091 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6171092 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6171093 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6171094 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6171095 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6171096 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6171097 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6171098 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6171099 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6171100 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6171101 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6171102 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6171103 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6171104 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6171105 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6171106 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6171107 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6171108 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6171109 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6171110 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6171111 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6171112 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6171113 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6171114 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6171115 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6171116 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6171117 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6171118 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6171119 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6171120 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6171121 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6171122 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6171123 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6171124 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6171125 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6171126 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6171127 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6171128 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6171129 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6171130 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
6171131 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
6171132 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
6171133 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6171134 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6171135 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6171136 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6171137 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6171138 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6171139 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6171140 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6171141 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6171142 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6171143 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6171144 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
6171145 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
6171146 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
6171147 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
6171148 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
6171149 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
6171150 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
6171151 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
6171152 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
6171153 el aparato fue hacia la pista y volvi por un problema de indicaci n de temperatura que es completamente ajeno a lo que sucedi despu s

6171163 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
6171164 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

6171175 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews

6171247 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6171248 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6171249 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6171250 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6171251 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6171252 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6171253 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6171254 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6171255 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6171256 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6171257 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6171261 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6171262 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6171263 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6171264 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6171265 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6171266 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6171267 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6171268 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6171269 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6171270 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6171271 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6171272 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6171273 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6171274 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6171275 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6171276 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6171277 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6171278 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6171279 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6171280 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6171281 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6171282 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6171283 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6171284 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6171285 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6171286 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6171287 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6171288 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6171289 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6171290 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6171291 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6171292 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6171293 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6171294 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6171295 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6171296 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6171297 i am convinced that it would be impossible to carry out transfer without compulsion i do not see in this any immoral measure i want to help the jews to come to the jewish state and to help the palestinian arabs to cross to the arab state i know that these things are not easy and involve a lot of difficulties and also land expropriation must be carried out and we must suggest now that we are prepared to carry out land expropriation in lita and latvia there was also expropriation latvia finished the whole thing in two years and now everything is all right but we will carry out confiscation with money and not a small amount but it must be implemented as speedily as possible
6171298 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6171299 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6171300 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6171301 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6171302 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6171303 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6171304 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6171305 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6171306 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6171307 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6171308 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6171309 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6171310 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6171311 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6171312 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6171313 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6171314 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6171315 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6171316 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6171317 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6171318 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6171319 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6171320 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6171321 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6171322 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6171323 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6171324 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6171325 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6171326 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6171327 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6171328 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6171329 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6171330 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6171331 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6171332 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6171333 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6171334 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6171335 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6171336 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6171337 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6171338 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6171339 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6171340 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6171341 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6171342 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6171343 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6171344 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6171345 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6171346 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6171347 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6171348 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6171349 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6171350 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6171351 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6171352 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6171353 you know the casting agents are going to call up and say whos brand new and youre going to give them someone whos brand new and theyre going to like throw seven inch heels on her and then theyre going to be like she cant walk
6171354 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
6171355 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6171356 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6171357 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6171358 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6171359 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6171360 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6171361 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6171362 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6171363 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6171364 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6171365 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6171366 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6171367 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6171368 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6171369 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6171370 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6171371 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6171372 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6171373 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6171374 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6171375 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6171376 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6171377 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6171378 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6171379 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6171380 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6171381 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6171382 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6171383 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6171384 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6171385 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6171386 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6171387 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6171388 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6171389 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6171390 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6171391 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6171392 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6171393 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6171394 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6171395 this is a planning took where all things are going
6171396 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6171397 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6171398 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6171399 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6171400 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6171401 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6171402 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6171403 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6171404 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6171405 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6171406 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6171407 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6171408 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6171409 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6171410 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6171411 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6171412 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6171413 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6171414 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6171415 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6171416 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6171417 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6171418 it may be the beginning of a trend but it may also be a bad sign

6171456 each time you type one of these your brain is doing something amazing
6171457 your brain is performing a task that despite 50 years of research in computer science we cannot yet get computers to do
6171458 approximately 200 million of these are typed every day by people around the world each time you type one of these essentially you waste about 10 seconds of your time
6171459 if you multiply that by 200 million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting around 500 000 hours every day typing these annoying squiggly characters
6171460 especially for older documents things that were written before 1900 where the ink has faded and the pages have yellowed out the computer makes a lot of mistakes
6171461 and the number of words that weve been able to digitize like this is insanely large its like over a billion its like 1 3 billion by now
6171462 next year if all goes well we can do as many as 70 years which would be almost the entire rest of the archive that is not digitized
6171463 its just pretty cool when youre signing up for a web site and you see the recaptcha sign you sort of know gee im helping digitize part of
6171464 like for example some sort of ink blot on the page
6171465 we might think its a word and we present it and you know it says type the two words and sometimes one of the things is a word and one of the things is just a blob there so sometimes people can be annoyed
6171466 when you pull two random words from books you can get some very random combinations
6171467 and theres certain phrases and words weve asked them to make sure dont show up

6171498 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6171499 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6171500 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6171501 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6171502 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made

6171507 the building has stood for nearly a century and has been well used by the community since the second floor was added 25 years ago we encourage the public to continue to visit the museums
6171508 i think the decision to appeal is shameful to say the least its a complete waste of taxpayers money
6171509 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials go to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone
6171510 these include the wetland inventory mapping project sensitive habitat inventory mapping project and the sensitive eco system inventory project
6171511 due to their environmental significance and sensitivity many water based and land based features within the city of kelowna have already been designated as natural environment development permit areas
6171512 overall the proposed amendment would see the removal of 62 properties from the development permit areas while including an additional 686 properties
6171513 the only way this can be stopped is to re open the debate the only way to do that is through a new council
6171514 it will take a new council to defeat this approach
6171515 i feel this should now be in the hands of the electorate which will go to the polls on november 15 and encourage everyone to consider asking every candidate if they will vote to defeat the appeal of the covenant my answer is already that i will
6171516 i continue to support these initiatives of council but to walk proudly in the city of kelowna i cannot defend the approach taken by council today monday i am willing to deal with any of the consequences as a result of this decision and can only apologize to the citizens for not being able to bring forward a different decision than was reached monday

6171598 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient

6171600 white fat cells are the conventional form of fat designed to store energy by contrast the main role of brown fat is to burn calories by generating heat brown fat cells largely disappear by adulthood in humans but their precursors still remain the body

6171603 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6171604 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6171605 this would appear to be true even if the obesity results from binge eating as this disorder is characterized by eating patterns that are similar to drug taking patterns in those with cocaine dependency

6171610 elspa would like to thank south gloucestershire trading standards and employees of sainsburys distribution centre in emersons green for their work in shutting down brooks counterfeiting activities the simple fact about piracy of video games music and films is that it is illegal and punishable by fines community service and jail sentences counterfeiting it is nothing more than theft counterfeiters are only out for one thing money and because of this consumers who buy counterfeit games have no recourse under law for faulty goods
6171611 we are very pleased with the outcome of this case and especially with the fact that the crown court recognises the need to give deterrent sentences for this type of activity which many people seem to view as socially acceptable it has to be remembered that those who engage in it are at risk of losing their liberty and assets

6171737 given the recent events in georgia we do not believe that the current arrangement in the european democrat group in the council of europe parliamentary assembly can continue as it is
6171738 we are already in the process of consulting our partners within the group such as the polish law and justice party and the czech civic democrats about the way forward
6171739 we note that the socialist group in the council of europe of which the labour party is a member also includes vladimir zhirinovskys ultra nationalist russian liberal democrat party who has said that the georgian prime minister is seeking a mono ethnic state and a fascist style dictatorship and claimed that following the us polish missile agreement russia was now entitled to carry out a preventive nuclear strike against poland

6171786 the framers of the declaration of independence provided inspiration for this monumental task we have felt compelled to undertake while making no claim that this work is in any way comparable to their epic accomplishment we have used what they did to inspire us as a metaphor to frame our own efforts and to reflect our deeply held belief in the assertion of thomas jefferson that learning is essential to liberty so in that sense we like them find that we can no longer keep quiet and to continue the injustices the present bureaucratic school system is imposing on our youth and their future
6171787 educators and parents have vital contributions to make and their insights and commitments should be utilized we knew it was time to begin a new and different kind of dialog we also felt that the only meaningful way to address the issues and challenge underlying assumptions was to define and express a vision based on relevant beliefs principles and premises our urgent desire is that this document be used to begin disciplined dialog stimulate questions identify problems and frame issues that will eventually lead to strategic actions at the local level and in governmental capitols

6171854 he hadnt pitched in six days and was going to pitch regardless today
6171855 every hit in the ninth was big we just couldnt get that real big one at the end all of our guys had good at bats in the ninth and pena came in and picked up lyon
6171856 de eerste minister is volop campagne aan het voeren dezelfde non campagne als tijdens het laatste jaar van zijn vlaams minister presidentschap hij duikt overal op op televisie en op sportmanifestaties maar nooit om over politiek te praten ik ben jaren vicepremier geweest en ik weet dus uit ervaring dat wie echt met zijn beleid bezig is geen tijd heeft voor dergelijke onzin
6171857 i think that one of the things you learn in the history of medicine is that many people think that the way to study a problem is to define the problem and then study it that turns out again and again to be wrong because you discover
6171858 there is a feature of current law that especially for high income people some people get marriage bonuses some people get marriage penalties those same people would continue to get those bonuses or penalties under both the mccain plan or the obama plan the obama plan doesnt add any new people
6171859 what is important though is to look at the overall agenda that these two candidates have for working women and what they would do
6171860 your editorial today accusing barack obama of creating a new marriage penalty in his tax plan and declaring a war on women was an outrageous distortion
6171861 the truth is that under obamas tax plan not a single new couple would get a marriage penalty because they have high incomes not one
6171862 there were twenty two women of whom three are working full time at this point
6171863 the idea that a return to the tax policies of the 1990s would harm the economy is supported by neither theory nor evidence nor the longer term history
6171864 numerous economic studies have found that lower tax rates do little to encourage work effort among working aged males who already are generally working full time but do provide some additional incentives for women to enter the labor force

6172023 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security

6172057 in 2002 president bush signed a born alive bill into law obama had said he would have supported that bill the national right to life committee says the language in the bill was the same and accuses obama of a four year effort to cover up his full role in killing legislation to protect born alive survivors of abortions looking at the bills the language is similar but the obama camp says while there were concerns about undermining illinois abortion law
6172058 a provision makes clear that it does not affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion obamas campaign points out that that added provision in that 2005 bill was a measure he had wanted in the past
6172059 well 2003 the national right to life committee will say the language is very similar but what the obama camp pointed out is that it lacked a provision to protect roe v wade that was the measure that was added two years later so that is the explanation why the campaign said and obama has said that he opposed that 2003 law
6172060 said the federal version he supported was not the bill that was presented at the state level
6172061 acknowledged that he had voted against an identical bill in the state senate and a spokesman hari sevugan said the senator and other lawmakers had concerns that even as worded the legislation could have undermined existing illinois abortion law

6172080 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6172081 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6172082 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6172083 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6172084 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6172085 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6172086 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6172087 im on the track hes in the water we cant compare too much hes the best in what he do
6172088 as he gets older physically more mature he can only get faster
6172089 the biggest challenge facing the lds church is not distinguishing their present from the fundamentalist present but getting people to understand the difference between their past and the current practice of the fundamentalist groups this initiative i believe is their first attempt to do that
6172090 i have to say ive been a lifetime student and writer of mormon legal history at least i learned many many things in her book that i didnt know she captured it very very well and was able to stress also what remained unimpaired by the compromise other books have been published but not in a way that would grab the awareness of the average mormon
6172091 removed all information about plural marriage from all its manuals
6172092 i have constantly said no man shall have but one wife at a time unless the lord directs otherwise
6172093 inasmuch as this church of christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication and polygamy we declare that we believe that one man should have one wife and one woman but one husband except in case of death when either is at liberty to marry again
6172094 all objections whether they be on abortion plural marriage seventh day worship etc basically hinge on whether joseph smith and his successors were and are prophets of god receiving divine revelation
6172095 god has commanded that the sacred powers of procreation are to be employed only between man and woman lawfully wedded as husband and wife

6172190 when tottenham made their offer i was sceptical at first
6172191 but after spurs boss juande ramos called me personally and told me that he wanted me in his side the situation changed and i agreed in principle to join them
6172192 it is my prediction that arshavin is going to be a tottenham player this season
6172193 wasnt thinking of diane schroer when he helped pass the civil rights act
6172194 but james madison wasnt thinking of tv when he penned the first amendment either
6172195 portanto eu me glorio em cristo jesus em meu servi o a deus
6172196 na verdade eu acho que o cristianismo a religi o que mais claramente merece ser honrada e respeitada quer seja verdade ou n o sua afirma o de que uma revela o divina
6172197 when you turn off front end controls word gets out if there is money to be made people are going to find out
6172198 nobody knew what it was for who is responsible for that how did that happen
6172199 it appears to me that some of these decisions almost rise to the level of being criminal
6172200 and looking at this report is almost like looking at crime scene photos
6172201 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
6172202 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
6172203 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
6172204 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
6172205 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
6172206 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well
6172207 i was in and out of the hospital for two months put under anesthesia and all that
6172208 it was rough i mean talk about insane they put a laser up my wang to blow up the kidney stone i had to wear a catheter
6172209 only joined the band because he was too young to get into 21 plus shows to see us play i think thats probably the best reason anybodys joined a band ever
6172210 all i ever wanted to do was be able to sing and just do it the way i wanted to
6172211 i mean if i could have anybodys life it probably would have been sinatras but i like mine too though

6172215 is he as stupid as dumb boy huh you could stop all independent publications you could disable richmond miami austin n texas nola and any other imcs that might reveal just how gad damn stupid you are go for it
6172216 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
6172217 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works
6172218 hey ed do you know what it means to have such a gad damn stupid person tell you he is a doctor
6172219 let us go and worship the stupidity of these bush nazis
6172220 woe to you o destroyer you who have not been destroyed when you stop destroying you will be destroyed

6172224 be sure hes wearing his gold medals you could say you won them champion sh t eater champion ss picker champion sh thead etc
6172225 on the other hand dumb boy could just bomb beijing and claim all the gold medals he would be the ultimate olympian he would even win the medals for team sports for they would have to forfeit the games these bush nazis can do anything that they put their sh t eaten brains to
6172226 he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears or sees and he will tell you what is yet to come
6172227 this guy killed himself i found a gun in his hand and i took it
6172228 hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes that do not see who have ears that do not hear
6172229 oh that that was dreamed up by someone munching turds on the toilet
6172230 i wrote in 98 that david wolf was the one to take over and get davids house of jacob built
6172231 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
6172232 nothings going to happen no body is going to do nothing about it
6172233 hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes that do not see who have ears that do not hear
6172234 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
6172235 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
6172236 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
6172237 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots
6172238 let god hurry and do his work so we can see it
6172239 let me take you down cause im going to strawberry fields
6172240 nothings going to happen no body is going to do nothing about it

6172243 fiction is both artifice and verisimilitude and there is nothing difficult in holding together these two possibilities
6172244 literature makes us better noticers of life we get to practice on life itself
6172245 fiction builds into itself a lot of surplus detail just as life is full of surplus detail life will always contain an inevitable surplus a margin of the gratuitous a realm in which there is always more than we need more things more impressions more memories more habits
6172246 until this moment one did not have these words to fit this feeling
6172247 i think that novels tend to fail not when the characters are not vivid or deep enough but when the novel in question has failed to teach us how to adapt to its conventions has failed to manage a specific hunger for its own characters its own reality level
6172248 have so finely tutored us in their own conventions their own expansive limitations
6172249 our goal is to bring awareness of the technology to the public
6172250 with some creativity and innovation we have the technology now this isnt some far off pie in the sky
6172251 we should be able to begin building the final car early next year
6172252 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6172253 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6172254 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6172255 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6172256 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6172257 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 per cent of the citys need for electricity
6172258 want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful offshore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6172259 experienced a softening across nearly all geographies and merchandise categories
6172260 we should be getting towards the bottom but theres all this other uncertainty that cause us to remain cautious not just for the back half of 2008 but also into 2009
6172261 obama is the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton
6172262 for the liberal party to try and blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6172263 of course well talk with all of the senators but ultimately it will be on dr nelsons head if this measure is not supported and he needs to start explaining what the health impact will be if he stops this measure going ahead
6172264 it was actually my manager that introduced us to begin with and he thought we would be very compatible together and thats how it all started
6172265 people have offered other things my way it just wasnt the thing for me but when this came about i felt a great passion for it and thats where it really stems from
6172266 its very bright and fun and then you have your classic blacks and reds
6172267 its about the comfort the pleasure of wearing this bra the comfort the fit
6172268 there are things that i love and things that i dont love about certain pieces that i even had at home
6172269 the second time i met janet she brought this huge duffel bag of bras and we went through them i love i hate i hate ah i hate
6172270 janets very picky about the fit and its got to feel like it fits
6172271 weve just started weve got a long way to go
6172272 if you can do this and keep yourself going you can finish this thing and use it as at teaching tool to inspire other people
6172273 its a new test sunderland are a team we think are small but they are looking to progress with this signing they have given me a lot of scope to have a good season
6172274 one thing is for sure there is a lot of potential
6172275 from the first match djibril didnt feel that his place was assured and it affected him at that moment the idea of leaving came back to him
6172276 i asked him to be patient but in the last match against auxerre last weekend where he was subbed he had made his mind up that he would not be staying i didnt want to go against his wishes
6172277 wife probably has cancer from all of his second hand smoke and just the basic stress of living with a control freak
6172278 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime
6172279 to me bolt is like what michael phelps is to swimming
6172280 at the start of second half we wanted to come out and we had a particular set we wanted to run i had a lot of good looks and knocked them down
6172281 there are ominous signs that the earths weather patterns have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production with serious political implications for just about every nation on earth the drop in food output could begin quite soon perhaps only ten years from now
6172282 to scientists these seemingly disparate incidents represent the advanced signs of fundamental changes in the worlds weather the central fact is that after three quarters of a century of extraordinarily mild conditions the earths climate seems to be cooling down
6172283 climatological cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age
6172284 dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and fuel burning may be blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the earth
6172285 an editorial display contrasting the ten commandments with moral relativist views
6172286 you can remove those types of impacts but still most things pro active would stll run the risk of triggering a massive eis it would seem that we need a broader
6172287 there are still plenty of destructive proposals that need full environmental review such as nuclear power plants the problem is that the 1970s law listed traffic congestion
6172288 seniors living in the suburbs and getting too old to drive safely is going to be a big problem in this country
6172289 the guy in sf is a crank too much time on his hands and gets his jollys tweaking peoples noses too bad the judge fell for his bs hopefully once the city gets

6172294 it is worth stressing that the deployment of the third site in europe with genuine anti russian potential by no means enhances security on the continent

6172296 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6172297 its real strenuous doing the same thing over and over and over it helps you but it takes a toll getting up early in the morning and going to bed late at night you just try to keep yourself healthy
6172298 the worst thing is staying in the dorms you get terrible beds terrible rooms its just uncomfortable the best thing is hanging around with your teammates

6172310 i believe in what he has to offer america as a young person i wasnt just going to sit back and watch it all go by
6172311 but if he puts huckabee on the ticket he gets my money and he gets my physical labor
6172312 if youre willing to laugh at a candidate onstage thats a really deep personal affront
6172313 thats what really made me say im going to open up my wallet and im going to give to this guy because no one laughs at money
6172314 i have to admit that you do sloth like nobodys business
6172315 i just sic them on punks like that like a couple of pitbulls
6172316 talagang hindi ko kayang magtrabaho kaya binalik ako sa agency ito namang agency ko imbes na makatulong pilit pa rin akong pinagtrabaho
6172317 if ofws persist in sending more money it will not be physically sustainable for them
6172318 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6172319 that is the essential role that the commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations
6172320 it is important for the service to have the opportunity to point out on the ground exactly what our security requirements are while the event is under way
6172321 people will basically give their first young to get really good access
6172322 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6172323 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6172324 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6172325 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6172326 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6172327 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6172328 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6172329 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6172330 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6172331 today could be the day and you need to be ready
6172332 we were the unlikeliest lot and that is precisely why god has chosen us
6172333 we should remember the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain is a minority versus majority issue and if it would always be the tyranny of the majority that would be imposed the aspirations of the minority would never be realized
6172334 if the peaceful means to achieve that aspiration fail what are the options war and conflict come as possible options
6172335 why cant we accommodate these aspirations if nothing of sovereign value is lost anyway
6172336 the situation on the ground has become volatile violence has been inflicted in five municipalities of lanao del norte and before that in north cotabato the fighting has developed and has reached shariff aguak in maguindanao
6172337 some dynamics that are contrary to what it originally set out to do
6172338 i dont mean misperception by those here in manila but also misperception about the same moa among the members of the milf and then some incidents of violence came up
6172339 some people do not understand what is a tro which is to maintain a status quo
6172340 some people on the ground like commander ameril umbra kato did not understand the tro he went ahead and tried to engage the cvos civilian volunteer organizations and the military in a gunfight
6172341 we thought wed never see that a government of the republic of the philippines representative would be the one arguing for a bangsamoro homeland
6172342 i think one of the things we achieved in the peace process is that the panel of the grp seems to have a more sophisticated and intricate understanding of what is happening in mindanao
6172343 at the end of the spanish colonial period when the spaniards were defeated by the americans the moros remained unconquered
6172344 by the 1970s the demographics in mindanao was drastically reversed they moros now constitute only 20 percent the population of mindanao
6172345 that supreme court case legitimized a process where there were less than three fourths votes on the part of the senate and the house of representatives said yes so the constitution of the republic was properly amended
6172346 if for the americans we have changed our constitution if for mining companies we are open to changing provisions in our constitution why is it that at some point we are not open to changing our constitution when some of our peoples want their histories corrected
6172347 i think weve matured in the past five to ten years maybe in another five to ten years we can hope to achieve things that are currently available in singapore or thailand where the awareness is much higher
6172348 the beijing olympics have truly captivated the american public generating record performance across all of our platforms
6172349 in addition to the ratings success the games have also provided a valuable environment for our advertisers to deliver their messages the feedback from our partners has been tremendous and were already actively engaged in discussion with many of them for the 2010 winter games in vancouver and london in 2012
6172350 weve always known that the scale and unique qualities of the olympics make it a singular sales and marketing platform
6172351 now that we have been able to measure how effective advertising is on the olympic platform we are sharing the information with our marketing partners and using it to optimize our sales efforts in beijing and looking forward for vancouver and london
6172352 i love the idea of the specialized bar without the frills and white star bar
6172353 due to the recent heavy rainfall in the county the rockhill water supply has been under continuous surveillance the surveillance subsequently identified e coli in the water supply as water services authority on receipt of health service executive hse advice we wish to advise customers that water being supplied from now until further notice should not be used for human consumption except under a number of conditions and for certain purposes
6172354 can you imagine two old ladies in their 70s being re educated through labor
6172355 were extremely proud of being part of this historic event and to be able to celebrate with our community the success of our athletes and their commitment to excellence
6172356 the response from our viewers clearly confirms that our award winning sports division is delivering the most relevant and engaging spanish language olympics coverage to us hispanics

6172358 the things that my niece is saying that joey sanders did to her over the past years she is stating all the way up to forced rape
6172359 if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

6172368 were honored to have so many of our products represented in such a wide range of categories

6172374 this is a great way for us to help the local and regional community and our members at a time when they need us the most
6172375 weve got the best lineup of products to make a home more efficient and those looking to save a little green or the planet will appreciate our prices they will see savings at the register and going forward on their utility bills we are optimistic we will be able to bring this concept to more of our clubs

6172377 seals can sustain quite deep gashes theyre used to that they recuperate
6172378 theyve got lots of blubber on them so it might look bad to us but for the seal it will recover its a normal process
6172379 ive had seals come up from being shot from fishing boats
6172380 seals are wild animals and should be treated with respect
6172381 interference by humans and dogs can cause them great stress and they can be surprisingly aggressive when frightened

6172385 we are concerned about the impact that will have on traffic accidents and potential fatalities
6172386 i would be concerned about the state of the road in association with the extra truck movements particularly more b doubles
6172387 the road safety issues are not related to port expansion
6172388 the road has capacity for the increase all of the planning studies for the port have indicated that the road has capacity for all the additional traffic
6172389 i will always listen to the views of nsw police
6172390 i look forward to seeing the outcomes of the working party and will continue to raise this issue with the roads minister
6172391 im surprised that we werent told about the extra movements
6172392 obviously there may be reasons behind it but until we meet we wont know
6172393 will result in an additional 93 750 truck movements a year or approximately 120 b double and 250 rigid single articulated daily return trips
6172394 it is likely that such trucks would use mt ousley rd then picton appin roads and the hume hwy to access western sydney
6172395 despite an exhaustive search docs caseworkers were unable to place the child somewhere he would be kept safe
6172396 however the young boy has had a difficult start to life and can exhibit extremely challenging behaviours in this instance they resulted in significant property damage and a decision was made that remaining in the motel room left the boy at risk to himself and private property
6172397 as a last resort he stayed at the docs office from saturday august 16 under the constant supervision of two workers while docs continued the search for a suitable alternative
6172398 the boy is now safe with a docs foster carer who is being offered special supports to cope with his behaviour
6172399 i said i would look after the older ones but the younger ones would be moved on

6172402 in contrast to piezoelectric actuators that typically deflect or move a fraction of a micrometer comb drives can deflect tens to hundreds of micrometers and unlike conventional comb drives which only move in one direction our new device can move in two directions left to right forward and backward an advance that could really open up the door for many applications
6172403 twenty nanometers is about the size of 200 atoms so if you are scanning for a particular molecule it may be hard to find
6172404 with our design the higher atomic scale resolution should make it easier to find
6172405 this is a proof of concept the technology im developing should allow researchers to practically and efficiently extract dozens of geometric and material properties of their microdevices just by electronically probing changes in capacitance or voltage
6172406 sugar is fast and allows me to easily try out many design ideas
6172407 after i narrow down to a particular design i then use finite element analysis for fine tuning finite element analysis is slow but it is able to model subtle physical phenomena that sugar doesnt do as well

6172423 shall i offer to the lord that which costs me nothing
6172424 is causing me to ask new questions it is causing me to rethink how we coach christ followers it is causing me to see clearly that the church and its myriad of programs have taken on too much of the responsibility for peoples spiritual growth
6172425 and youll understand how the church needs to change in order to help people become more like christ
6172426 what we show in this paper is kind of a big shock we show that brown fat is derived from a muscle like cell and that brown fat and white fat are completely different
6172427 what it means is that muscle cells are precursor cells to brown fat cells
6172428 of missing the weddings and funerals and talking with other writers
6172429 there are so many different ways that language can be brought alive but there is a kind of poetry or memory that really is a poetry of place and for some writers an important way of participating in the life around us
6172430 where the place comes to you as a presence almost moves toward you and because of the feelings youve accumulated about it we say its sacred ground
6172431 there is a certain private rich energetic sense of life we get in certain places
6172432 its a larger world outdoors offering freedom and privacy and fantasy and some things that are frightening but also ecstatic

6172448 schalk has always won a lot of ball for us in the past
6172449 but we do need to be more accurate at the breakdown situation
6172450 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6172451 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6172452 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me

6172456 there always used to be a particular city that was the centre of cool at a particular point in time
6172457 but now theres no longer a place where its at theres no longer any centre of the worlds popular cultural universe for a time it seemed it would be a simple matter of shifting from london to tokyo but instead street style is everywhere and in places youd never have guessed it would be

6172461 american apparel and uniqlo are doing what vice did which is to stop using expensive models and photoshop they use point and shoot photography which is more honest and exciting cheap digital cameras and the internet popularised that
6172462 theyre now transmitted laterally and collaboratively via the internet you once had a series of gatekeepers in the adoption of a trend the innovator the early adopter the late adopter the early mainstream the late mainstream and finally the conservative but now it goes straight from the innovator to the mainstream
6172463 were more of a news magazine than a fashion magazine
6172464 even if were writing about a band we try to put some social context in it were the economist meets rolling stone but back when rolling stone was good
6172465 in 2008 the only prevailing trend is that there are no prevailing trends
6172466 its not just designers who are contributing to the end of boldface trends consumers too are rejecting the commandments of the editorial elite taking inspiration from peers around the world to craft their own interpretations of style rather than buy into one trend from head to toe like the preppy or punk movements of decades past consumers are appropriating eclectic influences and remixing them like a dj does with music
6172467 its pick and mix its retroactive and its nostalgic so you get a chronological misfit of products and references mashed together to create something completely different think about nu rave its a product of eighties romanticism a product of punk a product of straight edge and of old rave the growth in cool hunting websites and businesses has led to the decay of the traditional time scheme between an emerging group doing something and it being spotted embraced and codified it used to be a year then it was six months now its about six days we have 3 500 trend spotters stationed around the world i sit down with them four times a year and well find that the same trend has cropped up in about 25 different cities
6172468 if you google street style you can see street fashion photography from all over the world whats interesting is not just the images from london or tokyo but those from places like helsinki zagreb mexico city jakarta even tehran people always ask me whats the next big thing but there will never again be a next big thing the future of fashion is that all of these places will participate there will never ever again be one the place

6172536 there was not tension but we did have some disagreements
6172537 the fire marshal came into the process late and created his own rules without statutory authority
6172538 maybe they were in the best interest of the most vulnerable but if thats what we need to do then we need to go back and change the law and not propose rules that go beyond the intent of the legislature

6172546 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6172547 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6172548 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6172549 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6172550 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6172551 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 per cent of the citys need for electricity

6172553 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6172554 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6172555 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6172556 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6172557 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6172558 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6172559 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6172560 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over

6172563 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada
6172564 is it ethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6172565 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada
6172566 imagine for a moment a doctor who has a patient with a serious but treatable case of cancer
6172567 would it be ethical for that doctor to give that woman morphine and otherwise make her comfortable until she died of her disease rather than offer the patient treatment toward full recovery
6172568 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6172569 there has been more research done and some of it has been questioning of the research that has already taken place and questioning of the methodology associated with insite clearly there is a public debate going on and clearly there is an academic debate going on

6172572 were swimming in the amazon which is a rather famous river famous for piranhas and snakes and crocodiles and other things that could probably kill you is there any chance of us encountering those
6172573 no they dont want to swim in this area the water is way too dirty

6172580 the game still seemed like it was a little too fast for him
6172581 the search for truth as distinct from dogma was to be made through the exposure of falsity by means of argument reason and logic this reason not dogma was to decide what was right and what was wrong

6172592 for the liberal party to try and blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6172593 of course well talk with all of the senators but ultimately it will be on dr nelsons head if this measure is not supported and he needs to start explaining what the health impact will be if he stops this measure going ahead
6172594 it was actually my manager that introduced us to begin with and he thought we would be very compatible together and thats how it all started
6172595 people have offered other things my way it just wasnt the thing for me but when this came about i felt a great passion for it and thats where it really stems from
6172596 its very bright and fun and then you have your classic blacks and reds
6172597 its about the comfort the pleasure of wearing this bra the comfort the fit
6172598 there are things that i love and things that i dont love about certain pieces that i even had at home
6172599 the second time i met janet she brought this huge duffel bag of bras and we went through them i love i hate i hate ah i hate
6172600 janets very picky about the fit and its got to feel like it fits
6172601 weve just started weve got a long way to go
6172602 its not their first rodeo theyve been here a bunch were just going to keep grinding it out we can always find ways to win
6172603 on top of the tragedy that happened with the attacker another tragedy would have been if hugh would have been taken away from this whole experience
6172604 im happy thats not the case were going to do our best to do everything he wants us to do out here
6172605 our fearless leader our captain our general twelve guys 12 different characters 12 different emotions hugh has a pretty good beat on all of them he knows how to motivate guys in ways other coaches hadnt in the past
6172606 hes very good at the psychological part of the game a lot of teams get down on themselves we can let it roll off our backs a little bit and go to the next play instead of thinking about what has happened
6172607 but when im here and im in the gym with the guys were doing fine were ok
6172608 it would be a great tribute i would think that just what weve accomplished already theyre pretty happy with what were doing were playing our hearts out for them

6172618 this means that when voting in the house of commons only i would be able to vote with the will of my constituents and not according to the direction of a party leader
6172619 in recent elections mississauga streetsville has lacked a candidate with strong character and principles this has repeatedly resulted in embarrassing consequences
6172620 it is essential that voting not be a choice between the lesser of evils citizens should be able to be proud of their choice for mp
6172621 corporate tax cuts have taken the place of education and healthcare spending in regards to battling climate change they have made it apparent that they have no concern for the state of our environment this is the government who upon being elected in 2006 cut funding designed to help us meet our goals under the kyoto protocol since that time the government has repeatedly ignored the need to fund renewable energy technologies or offer any alternative solutions

6172646 whats interesting here is that your brain does log things that you arent even aware of and cant ever become aware of we show that there is a brain response in the primary visual cortex to subliminal images that attract our attention without us having the impression of having seen anything these findings point to the sort of impact that subliminal advertising may have on the brain what our study doesnt address is whether this would then influence you to go out and buy a product i believe that its likely that subliminal advertising may affect our decisions but that is just speculation at this point
6172647 this is exciting research for the scientific community because it challenges previous thinking that what is subconscious is also automatic effortless and unaffected by attention this research shows that when your brain doesnt have the capacity to pay attention to an image even images that act on our subconscious simply do not get registered
6172648 we are conscious of what we attend to and not conscious of what we do not attend to
6172649 language is a critical aspect of school readiness and pre literacy skills
6172650 research shows that early vocabulary and language skills are related to later standardized reading test scores
6172651 these results suggest that policymakers and educators should promote smaller teacher child ratios and teacher classes in child development to promote better language interactions between young children and their caregivers
6172652 parental income and education were not factors in this research it was the quality of care that was related to childrens language development
6172653 it is not extraordinary or anything coming from another world
6172654 from the point of view of psychology i suspect that this is like for us if we have stayed one week in the forest and came back to the world you are a little out of it so if we have stayed 18 years out of the office or of the world when we come back we need some time
6172655 the important thing is to try to help the family if they dont know how to manage her
6172656 only when she starts speaking can we ask her where she might have been or whom she might have been with the whole time
6172657 they validate the premium that people place on personal interaction despite the very busy lives we all lead
6172658 no matter how uncomfortable the situation there are certain decencies to be observed
6172659 someone youve been close to is owed a face to face meeting
6172660 dont resort to a dear john or dear jane letter dont e mail or fax or send a text message phoning may be necessary when time or distance are a problem but dont leave a brush off message or voice mail
6172661 i have a feeling that most people prefer to get bad news in person but im not sure that most prefer to give it in person
6172662 psychologists have known for some time that reactance can cause a person to work in opposition to another persons desires
6172663 we wanted to know whether reactance could occur even when exposure to a significant other and their associated wishes for us takes place at a nonconscious level
6172664 our participants were not even aware that they had been exposed to someone elses name yet that nonconscious exposure was enough to cause them to act in defiance of what their significant other would want them to do
6172665 the main finding of this research is that people with a tendency toward reactance may nonconsciously and quite unintentionally act in a counterproductive manner simply because they are trying to resist someone elses encroachment on their freedom
6172666 should now be better equipped to suppress his reactant tendencies
6172667 suggest that reactance to significant others is so automatic that i cant possibly be expected to control it if i dont even know its happening
6172668 it doesnt mean having a vasectomy will give you this disease but it may be a risk factor to increase your chance of getting it
6172669 there are other neurological models of disease which you can use as a parallel
6172670 i dont want to scare anyone away from getting a vasectomy
6172671 its obviously a major birth control alternative this is just a correlational observation
6172672 it is common for the bride or groom to have some moments of realization about what they are about to do the pre marriage jitters are pretty common
6172673 i wonder if i can really give up my search for the perfect match now that i am getting married
6172674 what if they suddenly change and show me a side of themselves i havent seen
6172675 is my spouse really going to fit in next christmas when my whole family gathers
6172676 a newly married couple often makes the marriage ceremony so much about the illusion they want to project rather than a time of special bonding for the bride groom family and friends
6172677 so much goes into the thousands of details that it can become a tremendous challenge for bride and groom to stay focused on each other
6172678 the wedding and all of its trappings have little to do with the ultimate success and happiness of the marriage
6172679 if you are very nervous the opportunities for these mental snapshots will pass without notice because our self consciousness has robbed us of the ability to see what is most memorable
6172680 if you are more insecure when you are 1 you are more likely to experience more negative emotions in your relationship with your current partner when you are 21
6172681 the kid learns i can count on my parents to calm me down
6172682 do you rely on your best same sex friend at 16 to calm you down or do you distract yourself
6172683 we find if you are insecure at age 1 that predicts being rated as being less socially competent than your peers during grades one two three which predicts less reliance on your best same sex friend when you are upset at 16 which then predicts more negative emotion in a romantic relationship at age 21 to 23
6172684 it is a lot easier for people to take risks and accept challenges when they know someone is available to help them and comfort them if something goes wrong
6172685 the most secure individuals are able to turn to other people for support
6172686 the idea that evolution is an important determinant of who we are as human beings is unquestionable
6172687 the question is what does our evolutionary history or our theories of evolution tell us specifically about the nature of human problems or about their potential solutions
6172688 really a technical question that none of us have a good answer to
6172689 were not at a point where every discovery leads to another discovery were at a point where a bunch of people are trying to think hard about it
6172690 there are so many genes that are involved in growing a brain and each of the genes is vulnerable to mutation in every generation
6172691 the mating mind how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature
6172692 for our ancestors it was quite useful to follow impulses strongly and spontaneously
6172693 the point is really to quit wasting effort and to conserve energy when the situation has proven itself unpropitious
6172694 theres increasing evidence that we were never designed for our sedentary socially isolated indoor sleep deprived frenzied poorly nourished lifestyle

6172709 as the solar industry continues to shift toward thin film photovoltaic applications the technology will continue to evolve
6172710 today our expertise lies in the process know how required to produce a complete line of manufacturing equipment for the production of thin film amorphous silicon modules and we believe that amorphous silicon offers cost advantages over other commercially viable thin film materials available in the market at the same time we want to prepare for the emergence of other cost effective thin film technologies including cigs and micro crystalline by forming partnerships with companies like amelio solar and through our own research and development activities therefore our plan is to position solar thin to utilize other thin film materials as the industry evolves
6172711 programs and policies to eliminate this behavior may be more personally tenable and politically feasible
6172712 this is the first study to demonstrate that parents who report spanking children with an object and parents who frequently spank children are much more likely to report other harsh punishment acts consistent with physical abuse
6172713 addressing the use of objects in and the frequency of corporal punishment and their relationship to physical abuse may be appropriate places to begin this discussion

6172739 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6172740 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6172741 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6172742 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6172743 this haircut is from this morning i cant directly say why i did it its connected with certain things that the olympic charter forbids but i will say that its symbolic
6172744 unless the chinese regime becomes more moderate ill compete with my head shaved in a gesture of solidarity with the tibetan monks
6172745 i am outraged by whats going on in tibet when i read about it i can hardly believe ill compete in a country that bloodily suppresses street protests and persecutes people who dont agree with the party i cant believe the chinese have launched an immense operation to block lhasa
6172746 this month in beijing is a chance for the worlds biggest audience to see how china persecutes the tibetan people

6172847 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
6172848 this is not something we take likely but given the incident of this weekend we need to take firm action and this is the kind of action thats required in order to ensure the safety of our residents

6172879 met to discuss a proposal to the annenberg challenge for support of this citys public school reform efforts
6172880 smart schools smart kids a proposal to the annenberg challenge to create the chicago school reform collaborative
6172881 we envision a process to unleash at the school site the initiative and courage of lscs
6172882 t he local schools councils are important both for guiding educational improvement and as a means of strengthening americas democratic traditions
6172883 the profound educational reforms underway here in venezuela under the leadership of president chavez
6172884 share d the belief that education is the motor force of revolution
6172885 a powerful catalyst for chicago educators and parents to build on this base toward a sustained and serious advance this is the critical step that must be taken now and the time is now
6172886 over lapping entities each of which has clear tasks and responsibilities
6172887 the chicago annenberg challenge board the board the chicago school reform collaborative the collaborative and the consortium of chicago schools research ccsr
6172888 creating a grant making system to disperse monies to schools and networks
6172889 a clearing house for ideas for resources for information the place where strategies are created successes and failures analyzed and plans made and shared the collaborative under the leadership of the project director will publicize the challenge develop the rfp requests for proposals and application criteria host seminars to inform and assist schools through the process select participating schools establish working groups oversee program evaluation develop the metropolitan strategy broker waivers and resources and provide services for networks in other words the collaborative is the place where the challenge digs its deepest roots into the community and the schools and it is the heart of the operational work
6172890 which was widely circulated and they held a series of informational meetings throughout the city to acquaint public school staff school reformers and potential external partners with the mission and goals of the cac
6172891 in 1996 the chicago public schools were scheduled to hold the fourth election of local school council lsc representatives since the school reform of act sic of 1988 was passed as in the past two elections support from the central office of the chicago public schools appeared to be minimal
6172892 until that is members of the collaborative coalesced with school reform groups around the city and began to put pressure on the chicago public schools central office to promote the elections both by recruiting enough candidates for the open seats so that contested elections would be held and by urging parents and community members to vote
6172893 part of their effort was to seek funding to support efforts at the school level to locate and elect active lsc members the cac board was asked in early 1996 to approve funds for a citywide coalition of local organizations who agreed to work on both candidate and voter turnout for the 1996 elections
6172894 to make clear the connection between organizing a base of supporters for school reform with local schools and a training program on educational issues to assist parents and community members participate in their schools
6172895 after some expression of concern for how the rfp and the initiative itself would directly support the criteria used by the challenge in its general grant program chairman obama volunteered to meet with representatives of the collaborative to clarify the purpose of the rfp and to request another draft which would be more carefully tailored to meet the criteria and program of the challenge
6172896 a new rfp for leadership development was issued in june 1997 to address the challenges interest in organizing an informed constituency of parents and community residents who will actively support and participate in educational changes in their local schools the rfp went through a number of revisions as both the board and collaborative discussed its goals and implementation the initiative is a critical aspect of the work of the challenge as it seeks to increase not only numbers of parents and community residents who are actively engaged in changing their schools but also participants who are knowledgeable of promising and successful educational academic practices in schools
6172897 has been the most elusive to date with no major progress to report at this time
6172898 the challenge began its work in 1995 at the same time a dramatic change in the leadership and management of the chicago public schools took place the illinois state legislature awarded complete control of the schools to the mayor of chicago in 1995 a new management team and reform board of trustees was installed and a major emphasis began on administration financial stability and accountability measures that are tied to specific test scores the challenge began its program at the time the central administration of the public schools took off in a different direction
6172899 continued to meet throughout 1998 and provided advice and outreach
6172900 regularly participated in site visits and proposal reviews assisted schools and their networks in developing leadership programs and assisted in raising funds for the 1998 local school council elections to support a wide range of community organizations who worked to recruit both candidates and voters for the spring 1998 elections
6172901 supported efforts to recruit candidates and build turnout for the lsc elections in both 1996 and 1998 and provide support
6172902 completing funding of seven leadership development initiative projects by june 30 2001 focused on organizing parents and local school councils into more effective relationships with school personnel to affect curriculum and other academic changes in schools
6172903 also in the midst of creating a special fund to support future work of the lscs including ongoing training and development of lsc members as well as to assist in recruiting and electing members for the councils in future years
6172904 this was similar to improvement across the system there were no statistically significant differences in student achievement between annenberg schools and demographically similar non annenberg schools this indicates that

6172958 i made an effort to remove our claims as far away from the bankruptcy as i could
6172959 my reasoning on this was that if you reviewed the bankruptcy filing it became patently obvious that fox collision had more liabilities than it had assets given the bankruptcy preferences it was clear that the employees would see little if any money from the bankruptcy estate
6172960 i did however encourage my clients to submit proof of claim forms to the bankruptcy court to protect their interests
6172961 i also encouraged them to submit claims to the oklahoma department of labor since claims submitted by the government to a bankrupt company are treated differently under the bankruptcy code
6172962 i got a call saturday morning saying i had to get my tools because they were closing the doors at noon it was crazy
6172963 there are at least 100 people here in tulsa that this happened to
6172964 i am receiving conflicting information as to mr foxs residency status
6172965 the evidence i have indicates that his last known location was minnesota and prior to that colorado his attorney claimed in her version of the joint status report we submitted to the court that he was still a resident of oklahoma this is a crucial question that must be answered for the case to stay in oklahoma however regardless of his current residency this case could still move forward but may have to do so in oklahoma state court
6172966 the claims remaining in the former employees case are an oklahoma wage and hour claim for the unpaid wages of oklahoma employees in tulsa and oklahoma city and certain tort claims that i added in an amended complaint
6172967 these tort claims are related to mr foxs alleged conversion of funds in that it is our belief that he wrote payroll checks to his employees and then removed the money from the bank before the checks had an opportunity to clear i do have evidence of this fact from one of his former employees who put together the payroll according to her the money was in the bank when she put the payroll together and he signed the payroll checks there was no reason for the checks not to clear unless he removed the money another interesting point on this issue is that the money removed from the payroll account was not listed in the bankruptcy filings so far as i could see my suspicion unconfirmed at this time is that mr fox absconded with the money and did not list it as an asset on the bankruptcy filing
6172968 i was unable to establish a warn act violation since mr foxs facilities here in tulsa did not have enough employees and i was unable to establish the required connection between each of the shops simply put each of the stores operated as an autonomous unit and could not be combined under the warn act to constitute one facility
6172969 given the state of the law and the bankruptcy issues related to fox collision center i elected to dismiss the warn act claims and the fox collision defendants and repostured the case to where the claims were solely directed to mr fox as an individual

6172980 integrated interdisciplinary inquiry is one of usfs strategic priorities and i am counting on dr tobin to work with faculty members chairs and deans to identify and mitigate institutional barriers to enhanced scholarly collaborations
6172981 dr tobins experience as a researcher instructor and administrator provide the perfect blend of knowledge and skills to lead this extensive initiative
6172982 in spite of recent budgetary setbacks usf remains a remarkable university as we move ahead i look forward to working alongside other faculty staff students and administrators to help us all achieve our ambitious goals
6172983 the university of the future will be a global university
6172984 linda whiteford is the perfect person to develop and lead our efforts in global research and learning
6172985 this new position is part of our efforts to organize the universitys leadership around our strategic goals and usfs role in the world is a central goal
6172986 we want to make a real difference in the global quality of the education our students receive at usf
6172987 one immediate initiative is creating the usf world task force with donna petersen the dean of the college of public health where we look forward to developing exciting opportunities for both students and faculty
6172988 there isnt a night thats gone by that i havent thought about it
6172989 alls he had to do was undo his seatbelt and he would have went to jail
6172990 well i was trying to get out of the way but in that 1 6 seconds thats all i had to recognize what was happening formulate a plan and take action
6172991 i wasnt even aiming when i fired my two rounds
6172992 i dont want to put ideas or words in his mouth but it appeared that he was trying to use me as some kind of political you know chip in the pot
6172993 the one thing i want to leave my children is an honorable name

6172997 craig williams spotted the grenade and recognised what it was immediately so he rang the police
6172998 he picked it up and put it into an empty skip so that if it did blow up it might contain the blast
6172999 at this stage we dont know where it came from but we will be able to go through our records and work out where we picked the skip up from
6173000 help help someone is trying to kill me im being crushed
6173001 the other people we can remember in incidents like this have not been quite so lucky most people stuck in these lorries while they are compacting receive very serious injuries and its difficult to get them out
6173002 we managed to reverse the crushing process back at the depot and with a bit of exploration and digging around in the rubbish the man was helped out
6173003 i think he has certainly learnt a few new english phrases after his experience
6173004 the other people we can remember in incidents like this
6173005 he was very lucky the compactor was not switched on or he could have been seriously injured
6173006 all businesses must undertake responsible waste management and disposal the epa has an obligation to take action where companies are clearly flouting environmental laws inappropriate management of waste may pose a hazard to both local communities and the environment and will not be tolerated
6173007 its been a mad few days i came into work yesterday and they had a tub of green body paint and some sponges i knew it was going to be a long day but its all been good fun and the amount of funny looks and positive comments we have received has been well worth the effort
6173008 we have drummed up a tremendous amount of publicity over the last few days everyone in cardiff is gripped by the recent ufo sightings and its been a great opportunity for us to boost sales during difficult times with the recent credit crunch
6173009 im shocked when i paid for the thing and someone else is filling it its inconvenient and distressing and i was so cross
6173010 its an inconvenience as ive got a lot of rubble upstairs that i cant put in my skip i would tell other people to get a skip with covers
6173011 i phoned scarborough council and they told me i would be prosecuted if i took anything out and dumped it on the side of the road
6173012 if a resident employs a private contractor to help dispose of their waste then it is the residents responsibility to keep it secure
6173013 the council and ultimately the council tax payer cannot be held responsible for securing private skips within the borough
6173014 while we sympathise with this resident we have limited powers in much the same way with regards to fly tipping on private land
6173015 if however a skip has been placed on the public highway and is causing a defined nuisance for example obstruction to other road users then action may be undertaken by the highways authority depending upon the circumstances
6173016 we offer material damage insurance which can include cover for the skips themselves however the excess on these policies can be as much as 1 000 which is fine for the large bins but would be more than the cost of a smaller skip
6173017 skips are very big and very heavy and as long as the public are encountering them youd better believe that insurance is a good idea
6173018 in the event of the skip being stolen the customer will be held liable replacement of the skip will be on a new for old basis
6173019 danger caused by the skip or its contents to third parties
6173020 if the skip is involved in an accident you are liable if the skip is stolen you are liable
6173021 the amount of waste wood still going to landfill in the uk is astonishing the addition of the flexhammer helps us to divert more material from landfill and recycle it into products for a variety of uses including energy production
6173022 this is a necessary part of providing the reliable efficient and on time service we are renowned for
6173023 as well as ensuring a reliable and dedicated service it means we are always one step ahead this is also reflected in our purchase of the first mobile iqr flexhammer in the uk
6173024 the flexible hammers make this a true multi material machine we can quickly and easily move the machine to a different part of the yard and switch from wood waste processing to converting residual waste into rdf without having the laborious task and associated downtime of changing the hammers to cope with the change in material material that would previously have gone to landfill can now be converted into a highly sought after environmentally sustainable rdf product
6173025 some material just cant be recycled but it can be converted into a valuable carbon friendly fuel that can form part of the answer to on going sustainable energy production
6173026 this machine will help us to divert even more material from landfill and provide an environmentally sustainable fuel that can help reduce carbon emissions
6173027 although there has been great progress in diverting frames from landfill i feel underlying perceptions have to change if we are to maintain this momentum volumes of waste pvc u are growing as more early generation windows are replaced and the material should be regarded as a valuable and very recyclable resource rather than rubbish to be uselessly thrown away
6173028 because of the escalating price of virgin material there is demand for replacing this with recycled pvc u wherever possible hence we have invested heavily in new plant and equipment to supply this growing market
6173029 with environmental and sustainable issues at the top of the agenda changing our perception of waste and re using what weve got should be top priority in twenty years time we wont see plastic pop bottles lying around theyll be a resource for recycling it should be the same for waste building plastics
6173030 its the first time ive ever bought volvo so i spoke with friends in the industry who run them and everyone using them gave a good report we trialled one and the drivers were pleased with it specifically they liked the image the driving position the access the good steering lock manoeuvrability and the overall driving experience
6173031 from the operational point of view we need trucks back on the road quickly after services and when things need fixing the local volvo dealer hartshorne has a good reputation and the trucks are reliable
6173032 everything so far has been very good as well as specifying supplying and warranting vehicles hartshornes hy parts service caters for the supply service and repair of ptos and hydraulic systems which is an added bonus
6173033 skeltons new treatment facility is a significant investment for the business and marks an exciting new era for the company as we continue to offer more services to the private and commercial customer
6173034 having made the decision to invest in our waste treatment and transfer facility we needed a supplier who was experienced in waste handling systems and could also provide a high quality of processing machinery
6173035 carmac listened to our requirements and their knowledge and expertise of the recycling industry made them the ideal partner for this project
6173036 as part of the sites commissioning phase we have also been testing the capabilities of the site by trialling it with selected customers initially they have had daily access from 7am until 2am but we are confident that our objective of having a 24 7 364 day operation will become a reality in the near future
6173037 im not planning on using it for a while yet
6173038 interest in working with the probation service comes right from the top at viridor the resource management sector is expected to be short of human resources in the next few years and is in need of a good sustainable source of employees
6173039 viridor has given me the opportunity to get back into work and learn new skills that will allow me to move my life forward towards a positive future ex offenders can experience discrimination during the interview process and this scheme puts us on equal footing with others offering us a clean slate and training opportunities
6173040 its a great honour for everyone involved with topskips to be recognised in this way the award is as much for my partners katy attwood and kenny goodman and our fantastic team including louise malpas and steve wild as it is for me especially as most of them went to the dinner to collect it as we were on holiday
6173041 were very proud of what weve achieved in skip hire over the past five years and really excited about what were going to achieve in skip hire total waste management container hire toilet hire plant hire and many other projects not yet released to the public in the future
6173042 we are very pro active in investigating fly tips and these cameras will help us track down the people dumping rubbish and putting a blot on the landscape
6173043 cleaning up fly tips costs councils 76m a year nationally using these cameras will hopefully act as a deterrent and the evidence gained lead to more successful prosecutions with those responsible punished and paying the price
6173044 a world of difference to the management of resources and waste
6173045 waste industry can rightly lay claim to dynamic and fast changing business sectors and pace of change has been relentless saturated with legislation targets escalation costs and a lot of competition we still have to satisfy the criteria of sustainability
6173046 never before have we been faced with the challenge of building 800 or more waste facilities in such a short time frame
6173047 time lags between policy demands and institutional responses are lengthening and institutions charged with these policies need to change now to keep up with the process
6173048 never before has there been so much uncertainty over whether the planning system will facilitate the substantial infrastructure development needed for these waste diversion targets to be met
6173049 the planning system is stretched to the limit and although much has been done to simplify the process the truth is that its not delivering at the speed it should be
6173050 one of my priorities for the year is to help the institution to strengthen its position as the leading professional body for waste and resource management both nationally and internationally
6173051 weve been told we can only dump the waste in wellingborough and northampton this isnt viable because we only have an hour at a time with the students and if we had to travel to wellingborough or northampton that would take up all the time the county council funds our project and yet another part of the authority is blocking its work we just hope common sense prevails
6173052 we get told off for riding our bmx bikes in the town now we get told off just for helping people why should we bother
6173053 theyve helped residents including people with disabilities single mums with young children and elderly couples the work theyve done has been fantastic we hope this issue can be resolved
6173054 reverend evans at whitefriars church was advised in march prior to the work being carried out that a charity permit was required to dispose of waste at specific sites in the county one a landfill site in wellingborough one a waste transfer station in northampton when charity workers arrived at the rushden household waste recycling centre they did not have the required permit and were again advised of the need for a permit permits cost 25p each and would have been issued in this circumstance so the waste could have been taken to the landfill sites which are set up to take such rubbish
6173055 we are looking at all the options we have asked estech to prove the things they say they can achieve and were waiting for some of the details but there are other options
6173056 i had no idea id done it weve been clearing out the house
6173057 in terms of significant discoveries during my career this table has got to be right up there in the top 10 because it is so rare
6173058 people have nothing to lose and everything to gain from getting a professional valuation
6173059 can it be tailored to suit an individual vehicle or operation can it be transferred from one truck to another is it accurate to within 50kg is it simple to operate is it robust and reliable does the system come with a tailor made warranty is it quick and easy to install does the system come with a nationwide aftersales and service backup
6173060 companies trying to dispose of their green waste material like to come to us because we provide a very low cost service we also think they like our genuine environmental intentions
6173061 weve had to try to replace vehicles weve had to cancel work and we might have to lay some of the part time workers off at the end of this week some customers have been good as gold but some have not been sympathetic at the end of the day its not our fault we are going to bear the brunt and hope the insurance is sorted as soon as possible were in their hands
6173062 its a time of the year when everybody is struggling all were trying to do is earn a living
6173063 its our livelihood someone is trying to put us out of business some people like to brag about things like this so i hope if anyone hears anything they will tell the police
6173064 the stickers have several purposes they will indicate that the environmental protection team are aware of an incident of fly tipping they may help jog someones memory and help bring forward potential witnesses and will also highlight where waste has been incorrectly disposed of they also carry the important message that people shouldnt touch fly tipped materials similarly the bags we have introduced are to contain waste that may have escaped from plastic sacks or may spread around the area if we dont do something about it they are biodegradable too which means that we are doing our bit in terms of waste minimisation
6173065 im so angry its not just the scouts who have missed out the people of dringhouses rely on us to pick their paper up were trying to do something good for the community and this is how we are repaid it is so frustrating normally we fill a skip with 10 to 12 tonnes of paper but on saturday it was barely half full were also going to pay for a new set of boards which will cost about another 200 that is really annoying because we had only just bought a new set of boards after the old ones got worn out
6173066 ive no idea why they did it we cant think why anybody would want our boards and it would have been a very odd prank there is a worry that whoever has them might use them for nefarious purposes because they have the official scout emblem on them they might pretend they are collecting money for the scouts
6173067 martin hudson continued to operate cheap skips illegally deceiving customers and undercutting legitimate businesses this is not his first offence and the sentence imposed reflects this
6173068 i got out and got beside the lorry and put my coat over my head to shelter myself from the rain the next thing i knew i felt an explosion in my head and ended up 10ft away from the lorry and i was like a jelly there was no feeling in my arms or legs
6173069 it is incredible really i cant get over it i am a big bloke and to be thrown that far is amazing
6173070 policies should focus on pricing the bad rather than on subsidising the good
6173071 environmental issues which are not well managed are in a bad or worsening state and which require urgent attention
6173072 yesterday a car blocked off the top of the road and the lorries could not get in which could have caused a problem if something like a fire engine wanted to get through the lorries are large and it is a narrow road so the implications are it could cause a lot of problems i thought the developers were just using the skips in order to scare the council
6173073 the developer has to make money somehow but i do wish they would get on with it with the council and get something done youve got rats running about in there its got an asbestos roof its a monstrosity everybody wants a residential development
6173074 these are very exciting times in our market place and with our partnership with untha we are in a good position to benefit
6173075 i have a problem with skip lorries especially when they arrive to a symphony of beeps scrapes and bangs on saturday morning the drivers usually behave as if theyre filming a remake of mad max
6173076 when they block the road just when i need to drive somewhere or when they block the neighbouring street so all the traffic diverts down our road
6173077 the inconsiderate neighbour who parked opposite my house preventing the skip lorry from accessing my driveway
6173078 the town planners who failed to see the future necessity for a private expressway connecting my local
6173079 they deliberately targeted sites that are out of the way so they had plenty of time to get in and steal items their vehicles would have been very dirty and im appealing to anyone who may have seen them around weymouth and portland over the weekend to contact the police i understand they may have camped on portland do you remember seeing them on the island
6173080 if the driver hadnt been using sat nav this would not have happened we dont issue sat nav to drivers we issue devon road atlases and expect drivers to use them
6173081 i had to take out a loan on my social security so i could pay the 134 for the skip
6173082 ever since the skip got full ive been trying to get in touch with the company and its been pointless eventually i called averies waste management because their details were on the skip that was when i found out that they had been contracted by countrywide to deliver the skip to me they also told me that they hadnt been paid either and that countrywide had gone into administration averies were really helpful and have been working with me to try and get some sort of solution i feel like ive been deceived i shouldve been told that countrywide were contracting someone else to deliver the skip also why did they take on more customers companies dont run into these troubles overnight they must have been having problems for a while so why did they continue to take on customers when they knew they had problems
6173083 the way it works is they take on a customer contract a local whats happened in this situation is that a number of local skip operators have been left financially out of pocket and the companys liabilities are over 1 5m from what i understand this is a nationwide problem and skip operators have been taking away their skips and leaving the rubbish
6173084 i explained we were financially unable to take on the cost of recycling her waste without any contribution as much as we sympathise with her situation especially having been hit with a large unpaid bill from countrywide and the ever increasing landfill tax we acted completely within the law we took our skip and regrettably had to give back the rubbish
6173085 ilderton road and the area is notorious for speeding lorries and this junction is much too fast our questions to southwark council about why similar new railings are going in on southwark park road grange road and long lane as those on walworth road come out have never been answered its too early yet to know what really happened last tuesday morning but well ask southwark for a full review of this dreadful incident and that junction of course all our thoughts go to ngas family friends and colleagues
6173086 the incident is currently being investigated by the police following this the council will conduct an investigation into the incident
6173087 in 2007 some rogue fly tipping idiots were sent to prison by local authorities for a crime they did commit these men were eventually released and may be responsible for the continuing incidents of such crime in the calderdale area today still wanted by local government the fly tippers continue to operate as soldiers of filth if you have a fly tipping problem if no one else can help and if you can find them maybe you can hire the fly team
6173088 we have big problems with this in calderdale and its absolutely disgusting it brings the area down it attracts rats and rodents and its totally unnecessary
6173089 businesses need a licence to carry waste and that is what we will be asking for when we stop vehicles if they cannot produce a licence within seven days they are breaking the law and we will prosecute because were determined to crack down on offenders
6173090 the amount of waste we produce in the uk is phenomenal and basically were running out of holes
6173091 the chancellor has missed a perfect opportunity to help a vital sector of the uk economy merely putting off a tax increase is of minimal value to an industry already shackled by punitive levels of taxation skip operators needed a significant fuel tax reduction but this has just made effective fuel cost management more important than ever
6173092 fuelcard holders still cite guaranteed lower prices as the main reason for joining but we regularly hear that this is closely followed by the account management benefits
6173093 in the timber industry the margins are so small that it makes good sense for us to tackle the
6173094 the skip flip is far better than the tower system we tried as in addition to normal sized skips it can cover small skips right down to the mini skips because of the way the sheet is mounted we are only two miles from the town centre so on local runs with the time saved we can get another four loads per day the driver on the other wagon fitted with the skip flip is on longer runs and reaps the benefit of one extra skip however although significant it is not the major benefit the skip flip sheeting system has made it so much easier for him because theres a lot less effort involved he is approaching 65 and has decided to stay on as the physical element has been taken out of his job and its just a matter of pulling levers
6173095 the two wagons now do the work of three we save so much time
6173096 two wagons now doing the work of three due to the time saving is fantastic we were aware of the benefits but the true magnitude of this statement has blown us away just think of the savings against the cost of a new truck
6173097 but as each area has a unique waste stream so all our plants are different this plant at skelmersdale consists of two processing lines each delivering about two tonnes of clean recycled polymer per hour ready for manufacturing into new products
6173098 we are passionate about what we do and have found that exported material is not always separated properly making for a lower category end product recycling plants close to collection and bring points reduces the carbon footprint of the recycled material which in our view makes economic and environmental sense
6173099 we believe everybody in the uk wants to recycle but they want to know the materials they diligently save are being used to produce useful products rather than being exported the plastics recycling market in the uk can only increase as manufacturers come under ever greater pressure to use more recycled materials
6173100 stadler are a great supplier and we have found their engineering quality and back up service to be excellent
6173101 in the last few weeks i have recovered amazing details from georgian buildings which have been tragically left unlisted a friend tipped me off about the demolition of a supposedly mid victorian house near egham in surrey i was horrified to be confronted with a high quality oak staircase of the 1720s the best london quality equal to the finest houses in spitalfields with three barley twist balusters to each tread carved tread ends and ramped handrails
6173102 last year i was given a whole set of architectural details from a 1796 house in kennington which a neighbour salvaged as they were being put on the skip
6173103 surrey houses with wonderful arts and crafts detail are biting the dust week by week
6173104 wherever i go the old windows are being stripped out and replaced by plastic imitations yet the old georgian hard wood sash windows last for centuries if properly looked after
6173105 the collection is of vital importance for the restoration industry its essential to give it a permanent home and were seeking to raise 7 million
6173106 on the basis that a picture tells a thousand words etc clearly alans
6173107 i was told there was not enough food in the warehouse and the company wanted to avoid complaints it was treated as a bit of a joke
6173108 we expect the highest of standards from all of our suppliers and are investigating
6173109 why provide something for free when we can squeeze more revenue out of it
6173110 this discriminates between those able to place a skip on their drive and those who live in terraced houses who will have to pay it is unnecessary and should not be introduced
6173111 were being used as tax collectors its ridiculous it penalises people for not being able to afford a house with a drive
6173112 it is not the kind of thing you expect to see in a police chase i was expecting to see a car and people running about but there was this great big skip lorry there
6173113 it was stolen from us at 10pm on monday it is worth between 16 000 and 20 000 and it was probably stolen to order
6173114 lead construction professionals through both the development and implementation of the plan at each stage of construction
6173115 mr rumble is an extreme example of someone who blatantly and repeatedly breaks the law on waste but any skip company or site dealing in mixed wastes whether sorting it treating it or storing it needs a
6173116 it looks very impressive and to have more recycling of building materials makes perfect sense an initiative and enterprising scheme like this to recycle building materials can make sure that the gravel shale bricks and stones that we need to build new houses can come from recycled sources
6173117 over the last 20 years the environmental landscape has shifted dramatically to address the way we use and dispose of our non reusable fossil fuels the forge recycling centre will reduce pressure on overstretched landfill sites transform more waste into useful materials and help local homes and businesses to cut their carbon footprint
6173118 its a double edged sword nobody would complain at the governments initiative to reduce landfill but this move is going to encourage fly yipping for sure its no longer enough to say that increasing prices will inevitably increase recycling rates is it not obvious that we are recycling as much as we possibly can landfill rates at 24 a tonne are prohibitive enough this is going to squeeze my profit margins even more
6173119 as far as i can see this is a tax on tax we are forced to increase our prices and the government rakes it in in increased vat how are we going to benefit its not as if the government will reinvest this revenue into recycling initiatives also this is going to have a knock on effect on the building trade as it will inevitably increase the on site costs
6173120 its not easy trying to tell customers that our prices have to rise by over 20 overnight how many other industries could cope with such a hike if they really want to push a green agenda this is not the way to do it our domestic customers are going to laugh down the phone when we tell them how much a skip costs now
6173121 raising the tax by 8 per tonne per year to 48 by 2010 for active waste will make a whole range of waste treatment technologies financially viable for all wastes not just municipal the three year plan for the escalator is good too businesses need time to change and even the anticipation of a 48 per tonne tax plus steadily increasing landfill gate fees will be enough to influence many waste and resource management decisions
6173122 more of the increase should be regularly put back into the landfill community fund lcf and some of the money should be ring fenced and passed to the environment agency ea to assist them in dealing with environmental crime
6173123 we support the government in diverting more funding than it does at present from landfill tax into fighting waste crime
6173124 the upside of this approach is that it would help to push waste into licensed sites where it will generate more tax which could eventually make the eas environmental crime unit self financing
6173125 theres a canny bit of steelwork hidden under the water like youll not see one of them on the skip hire list
6173126 we were discussing untried methods of making the crossing and a mate joked how about skipping hire skip i would bet him 1m i could do it and here i am he is not returning my calls now though
6173127 these compact towable crushers bring full recycling potential to any building site rather than sending useful aggregate to landfill it can be crushed and reused on site or sold on to be environment can be significant
6173128 we had around 750 nominations this year and presented about 80 awards so red rhino did particularly well to triumph a gold national award against some very strong competition
6173129 if theyd unloaded before we managed to contact them then there really would have been no chance of finding it so we were very lucky to catch up with them in the nick of time
6173130 we would like to welcome mr anthony small of cox waste management and mr john sweeney of ethos
6173131 we will have representatives from insurance companies environmental departments and other authorities appertaining to the industry giving up to date information that affects us all
6173132 had basic health and safety precautions been observed it is most unlikely that such a fatality would have occurred scrapyard owners need to ensure that they make a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of the movement of vehicles and pedestrians on site and identify and implement appropriate control measures to prevent people being struck by moving vehicles
6173133 there were times when i felt like packing it in and paying up
6173134 but it was a matter of principle i had done nothing wrong and i was not guilty im an honest guy
6173135 this has cost taxpayers like me money that it shouldnt have done the whole thing has been a nightmare and shouldnt have happened
6173136 it was clear that the case should not have reached the courts the prosecution had to prove without any doubt that mr jones was on his phone they clearly didnt do that
6173137 you have to make the most of what you can do
6173138 we check incoming loads for quality as we know that not all suppliers have the same quality standards then shred using a powerscreen shredder trommel to remove dirt and any aggregates and then pass over magnets and eddy currents to remove any metals and fines the material is then fine shredded and passes into our separation plant where it is washed dried granulated and separated into single polymers using our separation chambers for the technically minded this is pe hd md ld pp pp pe mix ps hips and abs our finished product is sold to manufacturers in the uk and europe where the material is used to make a range of products including clothes hangers pipe flower pots and wheelie bins
6173139 we take in rigid plastic that meets our specification no paper no aggregates no metals no pvc from a range of suppliers over a wide catchment area our research indicates that many waste disposal and skip hire companies are now looking to outsort the plastic in their waste stream and seek a market in the uk
6173140 consequently its a much neater cleaner installation and its so much easier to use navigate
6173141 individual axle loadings and gross vehicle weight readings are available simply at the touch of a button
6173142 there are people in the county who are taking franklin county garbage out to essex this is a problem for the county because the county relies on fees from garbage disposal to fund waste management
6173143 shut up you hippy im creating jobs for street cleaners
6173144 at mitchells skip hire and recycling we always stand by local projects we are proud to have over 30 years business experience in the mansfield sutton in ashfield area
6173145 winning this contract with ikea is a significant sign that our can do attitude our constant innovation and our focus on setting ever higher service level targets are keeping us on the front line of the recycling and waste management industry we have a company objective of reducing the percentage of our product that goes to landfill each year and have managed to continue to achieve this even whilst tripling our turnover in the past twelve months
6173146 ikea has a policy of only working with responsible suppliers who take responsibility for the environment seriously
6173147 the police might have decided the lorry driver was not at fault but it is not good enough to say there was a blind spot and he didnt see surely there needs to be a change in the law with hgv drivers made responsible for their mirrors and to ensure they are trained to be aware of cyclists if cycling is being promoted then we need higher standards of driving
6173148 i have a large show in edinburgh mid june where i will be taking two or three midi skips into a large gallery where around 4 000 people will see the exhibition along with some of my other work
6173149 hi my name is jaine green and i am a tv director currently researching a documentary about waste management i wondered if you could help on a legal issue i believe at the monent it is criminal law not to have lights on a skip to have a skip without a lience to overfill a skip or not to cover it first is that right second i have heard that its about to be made civil law and that traffic wardens will be able to issue tickets for skip offences do you know if there is any truth in this and what effect will this have
6173150 thanks for your enquiry these are my initial reactions to the questions the law that most skip hire companies adhere is the highways act 1980 lights they are a legal requirement when the skip is on a public highway each council in the uk has a different interpretation of how important this is so adherence to the law is different in different areas of the uk there is also an argument over whether its the skip owner or the hirer thats actually responsible licence again different across the uk each council interprets differently as to whether these should be charged for or how long they take to issue only applicable if on a public highway funnily enough i had decided to start a petition at downing street about homogenization of skip permits 10 minutes before your email here is our permits petition we did at the skip recently skip permit petition overfill covering reading the act it is illegal to take a skip when theres a danger of anything falling out nets coverings etc do help contain this and skip companies would not take anything that presents them with a hazard insurance legal problem plus as it is getting more expensive to dispose of waste with increased costs of recycling and landfill they dont want it unfortunately it is the nature of customers to fill them to the max or even less controllable for people to add waste to other peoples skips this is something i have been interviewed on bbc radio 2 about as this is effectively stealing traffic wardens issuing tickets why have we not heard that it doesnt surprise me but as i hope you can see from the above who are they going to issue the tickets to for overfill the skip could have been loaded by a neighbour at 3am for lights cones not being on these get stolen all the time permits fair play if theres no permit and its on the highway than there should be a fine although we strongly believe that permit price terms should be rationalized across the uk the problem with a story like the traffic warden is that whoever has come up with the idea has not consulted with the skip hire industry at all they are probably doing it as a quick revenue stream but they just havent thought it through the skip hire industry is under enough huge pressure as it is and this kind of scheme just doesnt help sure there are people that abuse the rules but they are the minority
6173151 i was able to finish my rounds in record time and i even got to eat all the carrots myself this year
6173152 marisa fell for svens smooth charm hook line and sinker
6173153 by bringing these cases to court we want to draw attention to the fact that licence holders have a legal responsibility to dispose of waste properly and that might mean returning it to the person who deposited it
6173154 our error came about due to the fact we failed to fill out the correct form we tried to comply with our licence by putting the waste into one skip this complied with the allowance of having one skip of permitted waste within the licensed area while we take full responsibility we feel that as we have never been in trouble during our entire 25 years of trading we are just an easy target for their publicity machine even the local agency representative was apologetic as he felt the fine was far in excess of the crime especially as we had accepted responsibility for our error and pleaded guilty this was not irresponsibility on our part but simply an admin error we have learned valuable lessons from this and have put in stringent methodologies to ensure compliance in the future
6173155 its not the normal bit on the side we like
6173156 the only thing hurting was the drivers pride with the leg pulling from the other lads
6173157 zoes place isnt funded by the nhs and relies entirely on charitable donations last year we raised 1400 with a previous album and thought it was worth doing again except this time the music is even better
6173158 i have been using the skip locks for the past 4 months to reduce the theft of my skips and i am very pleased with the results
6173159 and its absolutely crazy one day i looked into one of the skips id collected to see what goodies it might contain and i saw an old waterlogged laptop
6173160 i took it home and hung it on my washing line to dry out i switched it on and to my surprise it worked perfectly
6173161 its almost beyond belief that a man with no training can set up a fantastic business so cheaply
6173162 the key to the sites success is its domain name the polish plumber the brainwave came when i heard the phrase used on the bbc news about the influx of new emigrants to the uk from poland with migration such a hot topic these days the phrase is hardly out of the media
6173163 in fact i cant walk past one without a quick look in
6173164 over the years ive found printers cameras and even a set of antique silver spoons i love it its better than sex
6173165 this is another example of an act of vandalism against the countryside and another cost to the taxpayers of peterborough for its clearance
6173166 i dont know why he did it but he put everything from the house in the skip
6173167 i didnt know until it had been done otherwise i would have talked him round
6173168 throughout the whole offence mr lewis did not deliberately fail to deliver addressed mail was not deliberately hiding mail and was not deliberately storing mail
6173169 on those occasions addressed mail he assumed wrongly had been dealt with while he was away from work but sadly wasnt it became mixed up with the door to door mail which he transferred from the vehicle to his garage
6173170 your actions have caused a great deal of harm not only to your employers to whom you were in a position of trust but also the community who lost goods and services to which they were entitled
6173171 this was aggravated by your efforts to dispose of the mail with the skips
6173172 chung is probably extremely dirty and may look dishevelled and wet due to hiding in the waste lorry anybody who sees a man fitting his description is asked to contact us immediately
6173173 while the camera was there it was quite effective but apparently it was needed at priory marina because of vehicle crime and since it was removed the fly tipping has got completely out of hand
6173174 its a daily problem which the council deals with by sending someone out to clear the rubbish up but now people know their rubbish will be taken away if they leave it there while some even think its an approved dump
6173175 actually its an atrocious mess people are turning up and leaving their garden waste flower pots planks of wood general rubbish they just dump it all over the pavement
6173176 some people are demanding skips to be emptied on a regular basis as a solution but who is going to provide them and bear the expense ultimately it will come back on the taxpayer
6173177 we take fly tipping very seriously but this camera has been relocated following a request by the police we are continuing our efforts to catch and prosecute persistent offenders
6173178 we encourage anybody discovering an incidence of fly tipping to report it to the councils environmental hotline 0800 121 8888 so that it can be investigated and removed
6173179 we pride ourselves on being able to handle just about anything but recycling waste from antarctica is unusual even for us
6173180 we were impressed with pearsons because they really engaged with us and seemed genuinely interested in what we are doing we have a legal requirement to recycle and we are committed to it
6173181 we arrived with a wreath and found the skip just sitting there blocking out the flowers and memorial we were on holiday when she died and did not get to say a proper farewell so this is upsetting
6173182 there was a lot of mess but i thought they were going to tidy up a bit there was china in the cupboard wrapped in newspaper they threw that out
6173183 i just sat in the chair and didnt say anything i didnt know what to say when they left i started crying
6173184 i went to shave but my shaver and cream were gone
6173185 i feel like my home has been invaded i dont want anything more to do with the social services
6173186 i had to go out and buy him new razors toiletries and cutlery the next day when i complained social services asked us to take what he wanted out of the skip
6173187 we are sorry to hear that mr watson has been upset by the clean up of his house he agreed to it some time ago and a social worker and care team have visited him several times to discuss and agree the process
6173188 a team of four women and one man spent the day at mr watsons home and cleaned and tidied the house from top to bottom
6173189 the care team was at pains to make sure that he agreed with every step of the process and mr watson okd the disposal of every item that was thrown away
6173190 they made his bed up with a clean lightweight duvet and put some food in his cupboards when they left mr watson said he was very pleased with the work the care team are now distraught to find out that he is upset
6173191 there were teeth marks down its side it looked horrific
6173192 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6173193 i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while

6173206 but wait a minute i love to go swimming and snorkeling and im a certified scuba diver can i still do those things and abide by the dress code
6173207 i understand most people are accustomed to not seeing a lot of clothing on the beach or in the water
6173208 we dont want to look like freaks or stick out like sore thumbs for being so covered up on the beach but i wanted to help make water activity accessible to muslim women
6173209 we went on a cruise in february and we wanted to go to the jacuzzi and i wore the suit im sure people were wondering what the heck i had on i wish they would ask instead of just staring but i understand

6173212 there are so many different ways that language can be brought alive but there is a kind of poetry or memory that really is a poetry of place and for some writers an important way of participating in the life around us

6173230 i so wish i had listened to my mom and grandma when i was 18 and would complain about some little tiny bump or feeling bloated
6173231 theyd say sweetheart appreciate it for all its worth because it all changes when you get into your 30s i used to scoff and say no i feel fat today now the jokes on me i wish i had been nude from the time i was 12 until i was 28 i looked great

6173235 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
6173236 it is inexcusable that so many parents fail to appropriately monitor their children fail to keep dangerous prescription drugs out of the reach of their children and tolerate drug infected schools the parents who smoke marijuana with children should be considered child abusers by identifying the characteristics of problem parents we seek to identify actions that parents can take and avoid in order to become part of the solution and raise healthy drug free children

6173258 probably the most interesting member out of all of those was scott smith
6173259 sometimes players dont get it but they obviously get it because here they picked a player hes not the big name not everyone knows who scott smith is but it shows me that the players understand what leadership is all about
6173260 youve got the captains when i have a problem the easiest people for me to go to are the captains because they were the guys that were overwhelmingly supported by the entire team as the people they perceived to be the voice of the team
6173261 but the problem is sometimes because theres three guys there are position players who feel they dont have somebody they can vent to or have a voice and by having this group of guys it gives them a mechanism
6173262 its encouraging because hes got the ball in his hands on every play
6173263 hes the guy that one thing you do know whether good or bad hes going to be involved in the mix anytime the players look at the quarterback as one of the guys that they want to have a voice for them youre moving in the right direction
6173264 i wouldnt say hes been a pleasant surprise but hes definitely put himself in the mix in a very short amount of time
6173265 you look at him and hes 275 and he looks like he weighs 250 so you can see his growth potential body wise is big but right now he has very good quickness he has very good instincts hes got pass rush ability anytime you have a defensive lineman who has pass rush ability usually they can find their way to get on the field before its all said and done
6173266 kyle rudolph what he lacks a little bit in explosion at the line of scrimmage in comparison to a more veteran player i mean the kids 255 but hes just grown into 255 he still looks skinny at 255 because hes so big but his straight line speed he gets down the field in a hurry and hes got great ball skills anytime youve got a tight end that can run that is at least an adequate blocker and that can vertically threaten all three levels of the field you know youve got something
6173267 at the risk of heresy let it be said that setting up the two presidential candidates for religious interrogation by an evangelical minister no matter how beloved is supremely wrong it is also un american

6173271 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6173272 president hamid karzai immediately called to congratulate nikpai he also awarded him a house at the governments expense said humayun hamidzada the presidents spokesman
6173273 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6173274 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words
6173275 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6173276 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6173277 gayezabi had a lucky few hours of electricity that allowed him to watch his former teammates victory he feared he would only be able to listen on the radio since kabul averages about four hours of municipal electricity a day
6173278 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee taekwondo team in iran
6173279 it is wonderful that an afghan athlete can win a medal in the world olympics
6173280 young people should draw hope and inspiration from this olympic win
6173281 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6173282 in a country like afghanistan the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting

6173338 the apa needs to hear from you that a new more scientifically based report is needed

6173424 while they continue to rely on a lot of their legacy products that have brought them to this point i think they are a little more intent and a lot more deliberate in moving into the wireless and handheld type world and bringing them another revenue stream

6173461 we can repair any small arms in the armys arsenal and we even repair some weapons for the iraqi army on the other side of the base such as their 50 caliber machine guns
6173462 the maintenance shops have averaged about 635 jobs a month since their arrival in december 2007
6173463 thats over 4 400 jobs at least in the last 7 months some jobs are definitely more time consuming than others but in the end every job has to be completed with the least downtime possible
6173464 provide direct support as well as organizational support to fourteen units within the 1st sustainment brigade and the 165th cssb and thirty three external units from various mitt teams to special forces we also provide 24 hour support to the convoy support center for any unit needing maintenance repairs passing through the greater baghdad area
6173465 my soldiers understand that the armor that they upgrade the trucks that they repair and the electronic warfare kits that they install save lives and they take pride in that

6173473 thirty seven percent of the colleges fleet runs on some form of renewable energy including biodiesel
6173474 using the butter sculpture is a unique way to fuel the esf fleet
6173475 this separates out the triglycerides which will be split in our reactor at esf a process known as transesterification that creates the biodiesel
6173476 dairy farmers are the original environmentalists recycling nutrients and water on their land so it makes sense that this annual tribute to them is itself finding new life in fuel rather than being discarded
6173477 this is a fitting way to mark the sculptures 40th anniversary
6173478 as onondaga countys local recycling agency ocrra is thrilled with this innovative project
6173479 turning butter art into fuel for their vehicles is a great demonstration of esf turning knowledge into practice what a terrific way to reuse what was a waste in the past
6173480 humans are no more born to be hunters than to be gardeners
6173481 we wrote this update to answer some of the criticisms and to provide more evidence for our view of early man as prey
6173482 one major alternative theory that has gained more attention since we wrote the original book is that early man was not a hunter but was a scavenger instead
6173483 we have found that while early man may have done some scavenging it was opportunistic very little of early humans diet came from meat
6173484 not one of the more than 250 living primate species is a scavenger
6173485 once a paradigm becomes established within a scientific community most practitioners become technicians working within the parameters of the theory but rarely questioning the validity of the theory itself
6173486 we are not saying that our theory is absolutely correct and will never be disproven
6173487 but we are saying that the evidence we have today best fits the theory of man the hunted than of man the hunter
6173488 it developed from a basic judeo christian ideology of man being inherently evil aggressive and a natural killer in fact when you really examine the fossil and living non human primate evidence that is just not the case
6173489 most theories on man the hunter fail to incorporate this key fossil evidence
6173490 we wanted evidence not just theory we thoroughly examined literature available on the skulls bones footprints and on environmental evidence both of our hominid ancestors and the predators that coexisted with them
6173491 australopithecus afarensis was probably quite strong like a small ape
6173492 it didnt have the sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods
6173493 these early humans simply couldnt eat meat if they couldnt eat meat why would they hunt
6173494 in fact some archaeologists and paleontologists dont think we had a modern systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60 000 years ago
6173495 primates that are edge species even today are basically prey species not predators
6173496 one of the main defenses against predators by animals without physical defenses is living in groups
6173497 in fact all diurnal primates those active during the day live in permanent social groups most ecologists agree that predation pressure is one of the major adaptive reasons for this group living in this way there are more eyes and ears to locate the predators and more individuals to mob them if attacked or to confuse them by scattering there are a number of reasons that living in groups is beneficial for animals that otherwise would be very prone to being preyed upon

6173545 humans are no more born to be hunters than to be gardeners
6173546 we wrote this update to answer some of the criticisms and to provide more evidence for our view of early man as prey
6173547 one major alternative theory that has gained more attention since we wrote the original book is that early man was not a hunter but was a scavenger instead
6173548 we have found that while early man may have done some scavenging it was opportunistic very little of early humans diet came from meat
6173549 not one of the more than 250 living primate species is a scavenger
6173550 once a paradigm becomes established within a scientific community most practitioners become technicians working within the parameters of the theory but rarely questioning the validity of the theory itself
6173551 we are not saying that our theory is absolutely correct and will never be disproven
6173552 but we are saying that the evidence we have today best fits the theory of man the hunted than of man the hunter
6173553 it developed from a basic judeo christian ideology of man being inherently evil aggressive and a natural killer in fact when you really examine the fossil and living non human primate evidence that is just not the case
6173554 most theories on man the hunter fail to incorporate this key fossil evidence
6173555 we wanted evidence not just theory we thoroughly examined literature available on the skulls bones footprints and on environmental evidence both of our hominid ancestors and the predators that coexisted with them
6173556 australopithecus afarensis was probably quite strong like a small ape
6173557 it didnt have the sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods
6173558 these early humans simply couldnt eat meat if they couldnt eat meat why would they hunt
6173559 in fact some archaeologists and paleontologists dont think we had a modern systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60 000 years ago
6173560 primates that are edge species even today are basically prey species not predators
6173561 one of the main defenses against predators by animals without physical defenses is living in groups
6173562 in fact all diurnal primates those active during the day live in permanent social groups most ecologists agree that predation pressure is one of the major adaptive reasons for this group living in this way there are more eyes and ears to locate the predators and more individuals to mob them if attacked or to confuse them by scattering there are a number of reasons that living in groups is beneficial for animals that otherwise would be very prone to being preyed upon
6173563 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6173564 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6173565 i think that sexuality is something that each individual should deal with in their own way
6173566 the american economy has been getting pummeled by the one two punch of soaring oil prices and the collapse of the housing bubble but a stubbornly resilient economy has failed to produce the two quarters of declining output that have become the focus of the medias recession watch
6173567 even if we are not in the midst of a classical recession the recent experience certainly qualifies as a growth recession sustained subpar growth accompanied by job losses and rising unemployment
6173568 although weve experienced seven straight months of job losses totaling 463 000 since last december the 2001 recession was twice as bad in the corresponding seven months in fact every recession dating back to 1953 produced considerably more severe job loss than weve just experienced
6173569 regardless of the price measure used changes in home prices from the same period a year earlier have rarely been negative and never as hugely negative as those now being reported at least since the 1960s
6173570 the corresponding drop in the price of gasoline isnt sufficient to reverse the shift in the vehicle market toward more fuel efficient cars or to curtail the push for alternative energy sources and additional exploration
6173571 some stability in the price of oil however should begin to relieve some of the pressure on consumer prices that has resulted from the sharp run up in oil
6173572 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security
6173573 we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
6173574 what is notable is how this is spreading up the income scale
6173575 it was my first nude scene and it wasnt supposed to be me i had a body double and we had some complicating factors with her it was sort of a last minute thing where i said ill just go ahead and do this i was really uncomfortable this crew that id been working with that knows me when i put on my producer hat suddenly sees me naked it was really humiliating

6173651 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6173652 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6173653 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6173654 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6173655 how are you going to deal with that when it comes up
6173656 but i told myself if i was going to get the world record it had to be here because the track is so fast

6173754 maybe if you talk to them without the intention of sex youll find out they are just like men
6173755 i believe in america and its protestant german value system
6173756 that is a good idea but you arent in power
6173757 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
6173758 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
6173759 according to the initial call two intoxicated females were inside the residence breaking things and tearing up the place
6173760 cpl j h thaxton and lt b c robbins responded to the call they located both females at the residence and both were extremely intoxicated still causing a disturbance
6173761 it is a pretty serious rebuke of the bush administrations efforts to tie the hands of states at the behest of industry
6173762 is contrary to the statutory directive that each permit must include adequate monitoring requirements
6173763 john mccain will say anything to win the presidency hell even lie to you about his tax plan foreign policy environmental policies
6173764 a r ssia foi arrastada ao conflito pela imprud ncia do presidente georgiano mikhail saakashvili ele n o teria ousado atacar a regi o separatista pr russa da oss tia do sul sem apoio externo depois de faz lo a r ssia n o poderia ficar de bra os cruzados
6173765 dirigir se r ssia de forma condescendente sem levar em conta suas posi es e interesses
6173766 de suspender as hostilidades o passo correto a ser tomado por um l der respons vel
6173767 o presidente russo agiu com calma seguran a e firmeza os que apostaram em confus o em moscou ficaram decepcionados
6173768 ataque propagand stico contra a r ssia com os meios de comunica o americanos frente
6173769 a cobertura noticiosa foi qualquer coisa menos objetiva e equilibrada especialmente durante os primeiros dias da crise
6173770 ao declarar que o c ucaso uma regi o localizada a milhares de quil metros do continente americano pertence a sua esfera de interesse os estados unidos cometeram um grave erro
6173771 claro que a paz no c ucaso do interesse de todos por m apenas uma quest o de bom senso admitir que a r ssia tem ra zes nesta regi o devido a uma geografia e s culos de hist ria comuns
6173772 a r ssia n o busca a expans o territorial mas tem interesses leg timos nesta regi o
6173773 o resultado que o conselho n o p de atuar com efici ncia logo no in cio do conflito
6173774 os dirigentes georgianos s fizeram isso porque tiveram o sentimento de serem apoiados e incentivados por uma for a bem maior
6173775 esse apoio acompanhado pela promessa de uma ades o otan fez os dirigentes georgianos acreditarem que poderiam conduzir sem maiores conseq ncias uma guerra rel mpago na oss tia do sul
6173776 acusar moscou de agress o contra uma ge rgia fraca e sem defesa n o apenas c nico desumano

6173778 we are excited to continue our longstanding relationship with pearland
6173779 we worked with them on the original gis plan over six years ago and have since worked alongside pearland staff to ensure that they are utilizing the latest and best gis tools this move to the arcgis server is the logical next step for pearland pearland staff members understand that they need to keep pace with the latest and most sophisticated tools
6173780 it was business as usual in mobile on friday night until a dark furry creature appeared from beyond the right field wall and began galloping around the warning track with seemingly no purpose although he did manage to swipe a braves jersey during his trek from the georgia woods
6173781 fearful of nothing and no one teddy bear took it upon himself to chase down the sasquatch and club him unmercifully until he retreated back into the freezer and grainy unreliable photos that made him famous
6173782 don and i have served together in congress for many years and i consider him a friend
6173783 don has been an outspoken voice against environmental extremists over the years and has strongly opposed the types of federal regulatory overreach advocated in the name of environmentalism
6173784 devo manifestar nossa profunda preocupa o pela estranha coincid ncia de se decretar uma greve c vica que cont m cinismo viol ncia e provoca o na mesma data em que na bol via se completam exatos 37 anos do in cio do golpe militar mais violento da hist ria do pa s

6173787 nobody likes to be called dead especially when they think they are still alive
6173788 breakthrough from the death of environmentalism to the politics of possibility
6173789 is the updated book length version of nordhaus and shellenbergers thesis its an important book as it encapsulates a body of thinking that has done much to reorient the us environmental movements response to climate change from al gore downwards
6173790 martin luther kings i have a dream speech is famous because it put forward an inspiring positive vision that carried a critique of the current moment within it
6173791 how are we going to get a democrat into the white house and blue majority in both houses of congress
6173792 politicians who vote against such initiatives wont pay a price at the next election
6173793 environmentalists need to tap into the creative worlds of myth making even religion not to better sell narrow and technical policy proposals but rather to figure out who we are and who we need to be
6173794 breakthrough from the death of environmentalism to the politics of possibility
6173795 notice how they contort their bodies in relation to the hand apparatus one cannot be separated from the other
6173796 if theyre really good at it you almost dont notice the apparatus it becomes one with the body
6173797 it was such an honour to hear my national anthem being played and six times
6173798 i broke a world record for my sport and the commonwealth games which i never thought i would ever accomplish it was the highlight of my career
6173799 what was traditionally successful in this sport was to be very very skinny and for me im totally not not that mold and i was never like that i had many people tell me you know you might not go as far as you want because of how i looked
6173800 that was hard because i was just as good as everyone else i deserve to be able to go and compete amongst the best in the world you know just because im slightly bigger than what was normal for a rhythmic gymnast i wasnt going to let that stop me
6173801 when you take the stress away or the weight away her body reacts in a more explosive way and in sport thats everything
6173802 we are now the best bigfoot trackers in the world
6173803 its definitely something we have never seen before everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
6173804 a freezer with something appearing large hairy and frozen in ice
6173805 as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
6173806 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6173807 if you hear of any leprechauns unicorns large cats or dinosaurs leave us a message with your tip
6173808 this we thought was an answer to a mystery thats been going on for far too long the best term i can use is it was heart breaking
6173809 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud
6173810 despite the strong headline number for retail sales if you look at it in real terms stripping out the price effects retail sales were actually down
6173811 is consistent with an economy thats just struggling to turn out growth of any variety
6173812 it now looks like gdp gross domestic product managed to eke out a tiny advance in the second quarter
6173813 the underlying story in this retail sales report is consistent with that
6173814 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6173815 what we saw through the second quarter is that exports and manufacturing really pulled up the slack in the economy
6173816 were expecting that to be really the driver of any growth that we see going forward
6173817 the leading indicators for the second month in a row were flat
6173818 signalling modest growth at best in the second half of the year
6173819 well probably see the economy over the next couple of months treading water
6173820 just based on the fact that one of the key sources of support for the canadian economy the u s demand for our goods and services is going to shrink further
6173821 until the u s starts to have a convincing turnaround
6173822 canada is probably going to at the very least tread water if not contract
6173823 tenho certeza que a volta de marta para a prefeitura a melhor coisa que pode acontecer para s o paulo temos plena afinidade e juntos poderemos fazer muito para todos os paulistanos e em especial pelos mais pobres
6173824 sou uma pessoa mais madura e preparada tenho coragem e apoio pol tico
6173825 vamos ampliar a inclus o dos mais pobres e apoiar a nova classe m dia
6173826 quando serra assumiu e kassab assumiu a prefeitura estava falida com obras paradas e caos na sa de
6173827 est provado ningu m trabalhou tanto e aplicou t o bem o dinheiro de s o paulo
6173828 quem foi que disse que s tem um jeito de fazer pol tica
6173829 these products have been distributed nationally primarily to food service institutions such as restaurants hospitals and nursing homes
6173830 in addition these products may also be sold at retail and deli counters
6173831 its not like salmonella most people have never heard about it
6173832 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6173833 when there was a breakdown in talks in 2006 it took the momentum out of the industry
6173834 if these talks had failed for whatever reason it would have taken the momentum right out of the industry
6173835 is extremely important it reconfirms that there is an industry going forward here for the next 30 or 40 years
6173836 now that the democrats were nice enough to fold up on fisa
6173837 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
6173838 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6173839 so the next president cant do a damn thing about unraveling this disaster which is appropriately enough an embryonic police state
6173840 ive always been intrigued by those people who are out there who you have never heard of who have written a million shows and who still believe in it musical theatre with all their heart and soul
6173841 but i never knew what kind of context to put him in until 9 11
6173842 i dont know why 9 11 made me think about everything in a different way but as an actor i remember auditioning for things back then things that were getting cancelled
6173843 i thought what if somebodys big break was about to happen and for some reason because of 9 11 the show is cancelled and that was sort of the stepping off point for the musical then i had to fill in the rest of his career
6173844 we kind of have the same responses to a lot of things
6173845 a smart look at politics pop culture and all the days top stories
6173846 n s ouvimos um grande choque da paramos e vimos muita fuma a
6173847 as far as practice today i thought the quarterback was very good from the beginning of practice through the end he was really throwing the ball extremely well he was throwing against the wind most of the day too so we feel real good about where he is
6173848 i think its an example of two guys who havent missed one offseason workout theyve been out here on their own throwing thousands of passes to each other and it shows
6173849 ive never seen a quarterback like him with his kind of arm
6173850 hes calm cool and doesnt get flustered hes always on to the next play
6173851 you have to know the ball is going to get on you quick
6173852 at first i thought the ball rose it came so hard but its so much easier to catch now i dont know if hes changed anything or im used to the speed of the ball but all you need to do is make sure you get your eyes around and have fresh gloves
6173853 there was one play in offseason workouts where he stepped up saw something he liked and threw a 30 yard strike on an all go
6173854 i remember looking back and as soon as i got my hands up it was into my chest i caught it but it was on me so quick i couldnt believe it you try to catch with your hands but it still gets right through them to your pads
6173855 he took me under his wing when i was staying at the hotel during offseason training in may where i was sitting there looking at all four walls wed just hang out and chill
6173856 its just like any other teammate when you come in young you need people to be around to feel comfortable outside of football
6173857 he didnt have to be in the hotel for so long i brought him up there to let him know he was family we didnt really talk about football i just took him up there to let him be himself and chill out
6173858 i always said hey you think i am doing good you should see my little brother the elder busch said
6173859 you can see it coming and i am glad hes transitioned well into his new team kurt busch said
6173860 the next thing i am waiting for is for him to remember who helped him get to this point and give some of that information my way
6173861 i attribute it all to the car of tomorrow busch said
6173862 one day i might call it a race car but i keep calling it a cot because we just havent quite turned the corner literally with this new car and trying to get it to handle better
6173863 its not the normal championship type effort but you are going to have your good years and your bad years and you have to balance them all out he said
6173864 the mind set for me at bristol has always been to protect the race car and get toward the end and then you really start to race these guys he said
6173865 sometimes you sneak up on them and dont press the go pedal until its 200 laps to go
6173866 once everyone admitted it to themselves that we needed to try a bit harder that was the first step busch said
6173867 theres a lot going on behind the scenes right now
6173868 its a continued effort to find little things here and there busch said
6173869 i dont think its going to be one little thing that puts us back in the mix its hard work commitment and the belief that we can get it done and get back to the top
6173870 my approach was simple when we won the championship it was consistency the 30 year old said
6173871 we had nine finishes in the top 10 in the last 10 races and even though its a shorter quick run in the last 10 races its the same mentality and philosophy for 36 races and that is just go out there and get the best finish you can
6173872 you might want to take a few less risks but thats tough for a 24 year old to digest kurt said
6173873 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent the letter states
6173874 we had high expectations for the 2008 season the letter states
6173875 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6173876 your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6173877 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6173878 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers
6173879 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6173880 obviously what we had wasnt working might as well try something else the electrician said during a break from work wednesday
6173881 you might not be able to print what i think about them he said
6173882 they thought he was going to be the savior the miracle man wilson said
6173883 i told them i would double the purse to 500 000
6173884 i would add an additional 250 000 for each jewel of the triple crown a horse in the race has won
6173885 liu xiang was our only hope in track and field
6173886 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army
6173887 i hope all the bush cheerleaders who backed musharraf simply because bush called the ex dictator a bulwark against terrorism are thoroughly ashamed of their support for such an amazingly dangerous lie
6173888 the motive for that cover up seems to have been providing an appearance of progress in the war on terror rather than an actuality style over substance
6173889 which mounts a serious challenge to the foreign policy plans of both the presidential candidates does either have the courage to call a spade a spade and to call pakistan a major sponsor of terrorism

6173897 the crimes being investigated by the police in this episode are apparently organized by not a small number of involved parties

6173964 the death of the mainline is the central historical fact of our time the event that distinguishes the past several decades from every other period in american history almost every one of our current political and cultural oddities our contradictions and obscurities derives from this fact the mainline has lost the capacity to set or even significantly influence the national vocabulary or the national self understanding
6173965 they are saying that the roman catholic church is now more hospitable to confessional lutheran teaching than the church in which they were baptized and confirmed
6173966 the single best predictor of church participation turned out to be belief orthodox christian belief and especially the teaching that a person can be saved only through jesus christ amazingly enough fully 68 of those who are still active presbyterians dont believe it
6173967 the churches desperate hunger to mean more in politics and economics had the perverse effect of making them less effective opponents of the political and economic pressures on the nation they mattered more when they wanted to matter less

6174002 throughout practice maggios percentage has been really good hes in the 85 percent range you can live with that in field goal range and hes 100 percent with extra points anything of any great distance wed certainly go back in there with joe

6174005 for the first time im not going to say im pleased but im encouraged a great deal by our specialists and their work
6174006 weve heard nothing from the dod ig that causes us concern
6174007 we feel pretty confident that there was nothing that needed to be fixed
6174008 con pasar a la final me dar a con un canto en los dientes
6174009 the case for health reform only grows stronger during an economic downturn
6174010 together we are embarking on a project that will not only impact the ethnic make up of the health care system but undoubtedly increase the quality of care provided to the minority populations that are underserved by the current system
6174011 increasing the number of nurses from underrepresented minority groups is a key strategy for addressing health disparities
6174012 i do not believe government should interfere in decisions that are best made by women their families and their health care providers
6174013 health and safety of young women must not be jeopardized in those cases
6174014 i think we should continue to look for ways to encourage adult involvement and support where possible in these cases
6174015 instead of fixing the law the liberal majority in concord led by gov lynch took the opportunity to eliminate it they have now created a situation where girls who are seeking abortion s will come across the border to have abortions
6174016 it was one of the worst decisions that a sitting new hampshire governor has ever made
6174017 the american people are entitled to a president who knows how to conduct foreign policy
6174018 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest
6174019 the land was purchased with the idea of future development
6174020 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
6174021 the bill of rights really is outdated and doesnt apply anymore
6174022 we as a nation should work to eliminate the poor and sick through social programs enacted by the government for all citizens to ensure our strength and bond as a brotherhood of americans
6174023 those who would sacrifice liberty and freedom for the false promise of security deserve neither security or liberty
6174024 one of the firemen initially began cardiopulmonary resuscitation but attempts to revive him were unsuccessful
6174025 i bring my kids here and the service its been good i come here when theyre open because its close to my home
6174026 ms johnson has medicaid and could go anywhere but shed rather come to us because of the service we provide
6174027 i enjoy working here and with my background providing care to those without insurance is very rewarding to me
6174028 when you compare the difference between the hours in the private sector what we are paid in the clinic might come out even
6174029 we as a nation should work to eliminate the poor and sick through social programs enacted by the government for all citizens to ensure our strength and bond as a brotherhood of americans
6174030 those who would sacrifice liberty and freedom for the false promise of security deserve neither security or liberty

6174051 we cant let one american girls dream take down the 12 of our dreams
6174052 you always have a chance but its a long shot
6174053 theyre the best team in the world i think theyve proven it for the entire month theyve been together
6174054 the good thing about basketball and why its so exciting is that anything can happen on any given night
6174055 you always feel confident with a team that you have gone this far with
6174056 ive faced russia before at this level its going to be a tough game
6174057 il nest pas n cessaire de le dire aux enfants
6174058 today is not a good day why do i always do this to myself
6174059 allies a complicated girl man theres nothing i can tell you thats gonna make everything make sense you think just because she likes owls thats the reason she wont return your texts shes not a fucking test subject and wait a fucking minute why am i helping you you fucked my girlfriend im gonna fucking kill you
6174060 dude its her im going to beep her in for a three way
6174061 what no dont fucking hey isnt this cozy hey allie
6174062 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
6174063 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
6174064 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent
6174065 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6174066 your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6174067 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6174068 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries
6174069 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6174070 obviously what we had wasnt working might as well try something else
6174071 you might not be able to print what i think about them
6174072 they thought he was going to be the savior the miracle man
6174073 i can take you all the way back to when the reds traded frank robinson to baltimore for milt pappas
6174074 its the closest thing to hell ive seen the corpses were boiling everything was burning there was nothing left that resembled a plane it was in pieces its a miracle anyone survived
6174075 i was on the runway and i could see the cloud of smoke the whole field erupted in flames over an area of about 1km square
6174076 the rescue workers couldnt get to the plane because of the fire engulfing the whole fuselage
6174077 this was a fairly elderly aircraft but saying that there are many of them flying
6174078 ive been trying phone them but they just dont answer i just dont know if they were on it
6174079 they were very dear friends and they would have put into effect immediately the full emergency evacuation system if they had been in a position to do so
6174080 we had just landed at barajas and were taxiing to terminal 4 when my wife pointed out a ball of flames at the end of the runway
6174081 at first i thought it was just landing but then i saw that it abruptly changed direction to the right and the wing seemed to hit the ground it seemed to break apart with a large explosion
6174082 i saw it take off and it climbed to about 200 metres when flames appeared in the engine it then crashed to the ground and disappeared from view in a hollow past the end of the runway
6174083 we extend deep condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the crash we stand ready to provide technical assistance
6174084 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6174085 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6174086 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6174087 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6174088 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6174089 i believe that i can be a better sheriff by having a better understanding of jail operations from the perspective of an inmate
6174090 my experience in the jail will help me to better understand our existing programming as well as any possible unmet needs that exist in our inmate programming

6174127 the song is about the idea that we have so much incredible potential as human beings to be destructive or to be creative and its tragic to me that the appetite for military innovation is endless but when it comes to taking on a project like ending world hunger its seen as outlandish its not treated with the same seriousness
6174128 the lyrics came to me as i was riding a bike home from work with my hands in the air i had just learned how to do it and i felt triumphant but at the same time i knew there were people at that moment who were being bombed by our own country and i thought that was incredibly powerful we have these little moments of creativity these bursts of innovation and every time that happens that innovation is used to oppress and destroy people so it struck me as beautiful and tragic at the same time
6174129 denver really is a music mecca theres a ton of bands an incredible array of venues and every genre is alive and well the hip hop scene is incredible the rock scene and the indie scene are incredible but theres a whole lot of bands that exist between those genres hip hop with latin indigenous instrumentation or folk hop the whole gambit
6174130 and our band represents the spirit of the city the fact that we got on alternative radio were really at the outer edge of it i think it stands out if people hear handlebars they go what
6174131 this is real exciting for us weve been a band for three years just performing locally and to just have a song that everyone in the country is hearing and this chorus that seems to be stuck in everyones head its pretty incredible
6174132 we have a friend who works in an office in l
6174133 if i were to pick our two biggest underlying principles one of them is that music is powerful probably more powerful than most people have acknowledged and we have set up structures to harness that power flobots org and the mission is to use music to mobilize and engage people

6174150 i think you misunderstood mark the class was taking about shreaded wheat
6174151 its a breakfast cereal its a healthy breakfast cereal made from whole grain wheat youve never heard of shreaded wheat
6174152 well for one thing your father is a colonel in the united states air force
6174153 yes he is did you know that he was a colonel
6174154 that means your father has very many people that he gives orders to but very few people who give him orders he is very high up in the chain of command he is an important person did you know that
6174155 that isnt all nathan he flies some of the greatest fighter and bomber jets in the world he flies f 117 stealths f 4s and f 4 phantoms f 15s the f 22 raptor did you know he flew the fastest jets in the world
6174156 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6174157 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6174158 well weve only done this twice but damian is pretty sharp may have seen this coming and may have warned john about the possibility of a secret party
6174159 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6174160 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6174161 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6174162 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6174163 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6174164 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6174165 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6174166 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6174167 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6174168 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6174169 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6174170 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6174171 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6174172 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6174173 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6174174 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6174175 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6174176 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6174177 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6174178 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6174179 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6174180 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6174181 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6174182 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6174183 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6174184 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6174185 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6174186 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6174187 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6174188 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6174189 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6174190 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6174191 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6174192 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6174193 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6174194 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6174195 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6174196 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6174197 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6174198 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6174199 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6174200 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6174201 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6174202 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6174203 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6174204 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6174205 who are open to doing something on the production side
6174206 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6174207 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6174208 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6174209 the exact number of sex workers trafficked into the city for the dncc would be impossible to calculate but
6174210 the police have a whole list of things they have to be concerned about as well and prostitution and sex trafficking is not at the top
6174211 my personal feeling is that we need to do a lot more im not 100 percent convinced that people understand what theyre looking at
6174212 the widget channel enables interactive applications and tru2way technology has opened the door for these types of innovations to work in the cable industry
6174213 were looking forward to working with intel as we continue to bring our customers new features and services that further enhance their viewing experiences
6174214 the success of the widget channel framework relies heavily on the support of industry leaders like comcast
6174215 we feel this support will foster innovation and help bring new and exciting internet widgets to millions of television sets across the country
6174216 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6174217 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6174218 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6174219 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6174220 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6174221 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6174222 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6174223 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6174224 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6174225 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6174226 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6174227 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6174228 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6174229 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6174230 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6174231 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6174232 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6174233 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6174234 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6174235 you are on a class field trip to the zoo while walking by the duck pond you see something glistening under the water upon closer inspection you find
6174236 damian did anybody else get sucked into the vortex or was it just the adults
6174237 was it the adults that were in the zoo all the adults in albuquerque or all the adults in the united states
6174238 well damian your story leaves out some of the details if every adult in the whole wide world got sucked in how long did it take for them to get sucked into this vortex
6174239 well your story is missing these details lets write this down in your prewriting plan ok we have that written down now tell me what did you do during those two hours
6174240 so every adult in the world every single one of them are being sucked into this vortex and you sat there and watched for two hours
6174241 what were all the other kids at the zoo doing while all these adults were disappearing were they watching too
6174242 heh heh heh yeah they were sitting there watching too heh heh
6174243 so when all the chinese adults were pouring into this vortex you looked at all your classmates and the other kids and said well there goes all the adults from china
6174244 heh heh yeah i guess we just sat there watching em go in
6174245 damian did any kids go get popcorn or a corn dog while all this was happening or did they just sit there with you and watch
6174246 mr r they just sat there all the kids just sat there and ha ha ha just watched the adults get sucked into this alternate universe ha ha ha
6174247 when all the adults from africa got sucked into the vortex did every kid say oh look
6174248 hah hah hah oh my god i think i need to rewrite this part
6174249 damian i think youre pretty smart for getting my offbeat sense of humor lets just say that your story needs detail well let this part go as it is for now
6174250 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6174251 do you believe in god since this was portrayed so incredibly well
6174252 dont ever base your faith in christ off of a man or woman they will always fall short and let you down

6174263 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6174264 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6174265 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6174266 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6174267 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6174268 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6174269 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6174270 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6174271 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6174272 whats alleged is pretty serious flashing a knife at a child

6174285 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6174286 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6174287 when were on the court were always on the same page
6174288 my brothers there now and i want to go there and help him out

6174291 they could possibly take a strike action but these are tough economic times and they have to have smaller contracts instead of larger ones
6174292 i dont know oh wait a minute i must have left them on the bus

6174300 there are reasons and i really dont want to get into that
6174301 es la peor situaci n que se puede esperar en una empresa de aviaci n y nos ha tocado a nosotros

6174306 que transmiten los servicios de emergencias de la comunidad de madrid y el ministerio del interior
6174307 parece ser que ha sido un fallo del motor pero las causas las tienen que esclarecer la compa a y los servicios de investigaci n hay que esperar
6174308 en estos momentos lo prioritario es apoyar a las v ctimas en esto est volcada la compa a y en la medida de lo posible nosotros apoyaremos en lo que haga falta

6174313 oh no she wore out those shoes long ago these are her third pair of red glitter shoes
6174314 j d strong has a proven track record of protecting the states environment and preserving oklahomans most precious resources
6174315 i have no doubt that he will hit the ground running and keep the focus on our states environmental priorities i greatly appreciate his willingness to serve the people of oklahoma in this important position
6174316 this is a great honor and i appreciate gov henrys confidence in me
6174317 i look forward to serving the public in this new role
6174318 they make us hate one another without them we could go anywhere say china and have tea wed communicate fine through sign language i think this exhibit should be on the desk of every politician who wants this technology
6174319 he the mayor was a little boy when the bombs were dropped
6174320 his mother was trapped under a huge concrete beam he couldnt get it off being just a boy his mother told him to go and do something good with his life
6174321 i guess they really wanted to show the world what we could do
6174322 people to this day are being affected by the radiation
6174323 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6174324 how do you find something to write about every day
6174325 will allow consumers to enjoy rich internet applications designed for the tv while watching their favorite tv programs
6174326 costs are down and sales are up and thats a magic formula in this business
6174327 weve indicated to the market if we can hit 2 6 2 5 per cent then were doing reasonably well so to hit a 4 were really happy
6174328 i think in the current environment everyone is more cautious about investments
6174329 if and when a compelling opportunity came up in the us local space where we think were well suited wed have a look at that but wed be looking for a majority interest and control role
6174330 interest rates petrol prices and consumer sentiment will tend to affect the low end of the business more than the high end
6174331 it seemed to me that the web wasnt going to be all that interesting if it just tried to reproduce what was in the newspaper i saw the importance of readers comments and interactivity
6174332 its a complex thing these days in journalism in how you view online collaboration and all these new frontiers i think if you look at sandeeps background its a perfect map for where journalists need to go
6174333 theres a constant openness a constant need to experiment and explore and more than any of that is the willingness and eagerness to collaborate with the public
6174334 several years ago i got active as a saja board member because i thought i could give back some of what i had gotten as a member of the organization
6174335 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6174336 im glad they wanted me back so i could redeem myself and what the team did last year
6174337 i think were on the right track i know bees coach paul fixter has been working his butt off hes going again on a recruiting trip and i know bees assistant coach sean gillam is leaving sometime this week to go off recruiting as well they really didnt have time to take a breather because they went right at it and right to work
6174338 i think its a great hire for our organization unfortunately for everybody in their organization its a loss
6174339 i say that with all due respect because i know how much paul put into that organization and how proud he was to be a part of that organization were fortunate to have him
6174340 youve got tons of fans a great ownership group thats committed to winning they take care of their players great housing an hour from south padre the gulf theres tons of stuff that goes into it its all here a lot of perks
6174341 we played prison rules all last year it was pretty bad
6174342 i was looking for a change this year there were some issues with ownership in muskegon we didnt get treated the way i thought we should have gotten treated and it was time for a change
6174343 a decision to trade a player like trevor weisgerber is never easy and never any fun to make weisys been with me a long time and is one of the most dependable goal scorers in the chl
6174344 but with the leagues rules for veterans we were forced to make some difficult choices among our players from last season and wanted to make sure we got something in return when you look at where we need to improve scoring goals has never been a problem we need to get better defensively
6174345 i think i do bring some leadership i hope and bring some size and the toughness and stuff
6174346 hopefully i can provide space the for the skill players out there to know the other team isnt going to take liberties on them im very willing to step up and answer the bell if thats the case
6174347 i turned to my deputy chief of the jail patrick firman and said i am going to spend a week in the lake county jail
6174348 i believe that because the idea came to me in a church that it may have been divinely inspired
6174349 i am sure some people will spin it that way but i do not live my life for other people
6174350 i live my life doing what is right and let the chips fall where they may
6174351 conmovidos por la triste noticia del accidente se unen al dolor de los familiares de las v ctimas y encomiendan a dios el eterno descanso de los fallecidos
6174352 una manera muy modesta de expresar nuestro sentimiento con las v ctimas
6174353 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and men
6174354 did you not know that i must be about my fathers business
6174355 i must work the work the works of him that sent me whilst it is day
6174356 i have glorified you on the earth i have finished the work you gave me to do
6174357 es lamentable que despu s que se desarrolla un modelo de educaci n f sica se olvida de la educaci n f sica de los ni os o sea esa es la base que necesitan nuestros ni os para mantener un estilo de vida saludable
6174358 crea diversos proyectos de salud pero en la prevenci n f sica no invierte dinero eso es una contradicci n
6174359 de aprobarse este proyecto el departamento estar a en la situaci n de no tener otra alternativa que incumplir el mandato de esta legislaci n debido a la falta de maestros certificados en esta materia
6174360 el sistema tendr a que aumentar alrededor de 600 maestros y econ micamente eso tendr a un valor de m s de cien millones de d lares
6174361 en este momento el departamento de educaci n ofreci un aumento a todos los maestros del sistema en el que tuvo que invertir 80 millones para aumentarle 150 d lares mensuales a todos
6174362 hay cerca de 1 100 escuelas y tenemos cerca de 1 600 maestros y la matr cula de nivel elemental es alta hay escuelas elementales que tiene alrededor de 400 a 500 estudiantes y en ellas hay s lo uno o dos maestros ah se nos iba a hacer dif cil cumplir esa meta

6174371 oh love i am so sad that i need to be by myself
6174372 it is important for the service to have the opportunity to point out on the ground exactly what our security requirements are while the event is under way
6174373 people will basically give their first young to get really good access
6174374 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6174375 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6174376 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6174377 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6174378 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6174379 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6174380 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6174381 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6174382 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6174383 today could be the day and you need to be ready
6174384 while hes an exceptional talent hes just not ready to handle some of the situations
6174385 that became apparent in the scrimmage prior to tuesdays weve gotten together with him and hes fine with that
6174386 this is disturbing and should act as a wakeup call for all those people out there that do not want to get involved in a neighborhood watch program
6174387 the criminals are organized and we need to get organized to fight them
6174388 if you have to ask what jazz is youll never know
6174389 the troops were recently withdrawn from counter insurgency operations and kept for dealing with law and order problem
6174390 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6174391 given the pricing and lack of carrier sponsorship in the u s we believe initial sales of the treo pro will be limited
6174392 as long as the intervention does not entail a restructuring of the debt and ensures the viability of the enterprises debt cds spreads can tighten
6174393 some people love me some people hate me but no matter what you think im shooting when im triple teamed
6174394 we start bringing in people more and more and mistakes start to get made there are going to be missed shots and there are going to be opportunities one thing about it the guys on the court can go all out because weve got five guys who can come in and do the same thing we keep bringing them in waves
6174395 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6174396 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations
6174397 a new paper bankruptcy reform and foreclosure argues that the 2005 bankruptcy amendments are deepening the mortgage crisis the article was written by david bernstein an economist at the u s treasury who chose to post this analysis as private citizen listing only his home address and home e mail address drawing on data from the survey of consumer finance he links credit card debt access to bankruptcy and mortgage foreclosures
6174398 the dog is unidentified and still on the loose the woman has begun the rabies series of injections
6174399 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6174400 they rank right up there with the great stories of our olympic history
6174401 i think we were all very proud and some of us not her because i heard her interview after the race would have been satisfied that she made it to the final at her age and at this stage of her development
6174402 currently we have flights from chennai delhi and mumbai to brussels and those planes go beyond to us and canada we were planning to link bangalore and ahmedabad to brussels and now the bangalore link will happen first for obvious reasons
6174403 with air india direct bangalore new york flights becoming unlikely the fight for bangalores international traffic will be contested between jet and kingfisher both offer service and inflight experience as usps how they try to do better than the other and lure passengers from big players like ba and lufthansa will be interesting to watch
6174404 i was quite disappointed the obama campaign to me represents a change from traditional politics and embodies an america which supersedes discrimination and racism this incident is in stark contradiction to that notion
6174405 for a candidate who is talking about change and who is a minority who is talking about giving hope to everyone it was very offensive to me as a muslim woman who wears a headscarf
6174406 americans just want to be left alone our enemies are determined not to leave us alone but our media our intellectuals and the democratic party are trying to soothe us and assure us that we dont actually have to fight anybody we can win just by sitting still and being america
6174407 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education
6174408 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6174409 we calculated about 135 times hed been interrogated and about the first 120 the only interest they had was al jazeera
6174410 they told him that they thought al jazeera was an al qaeda front
6174411 they were trying to get him to finger a number of well known al jazeera journalists as being in the muslim brotherhood
6174412 they wanted me to betray the principles of my job and to turn me into a spy
6174413 if we were going to try to silence al jazeera it would be at a higher level of personnel than some cameraman trainee
6174414 was trained by al jazeera in the use of cameras
6174415 these teams really care and they may despise each other
6174416 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america 2008
6174417 the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs

6174661 yes im afraid so i finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right people were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look
6174662 and for more than three hours too the mother was constantly squealing and yelling i could hardly concentrate and when darkness approached i had to rush my shots finally when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment i just had to pack it all in

6174689 its worth it and im going to pay for it
6174690 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
6174691 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
6174692 i am not only representing myself i have a responsibility to fight for my country
6174693 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down li said
6174694 it shows the dream of chinese sportsmen for generations and also the common aspirations of 1 3 billion chinese people
6174695 otaku the nickname given to the chinese couch potatoes glued to olympic tv coverage
6174696 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr
6174697 and were seeing people crowd around big screen tvs to watch the events theyre more interested in sports than in cultural programs
6174698 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up
6174699 with the sports infrastructure the facilities the coaches who are being developed here and the young people who will be inspired by these games we think this will be a formidable system that well have to contend with for a very very long time said jim scherr head of the u
6174700 in shooting we call it the home venue curse said wang yifu coach of chinas shooting team
6174701 mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles
6174702 there is so much psychological pressure on them that i thought more athletes might collapse she said
6174703 i have a responsibility to fight for my country i was fighting for chinas glory
6174704 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6174705 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6174706 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6174707 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6174708 i have family friends whose 10 year olds are asking for turntable s
6174709 he did a whole speech about how sound matters and someone needs to stand up for soun d
6174710 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6174711 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get

6174715 you can unplug your cell phone as soon as it is fully charged
6174716 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6174717 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6174718 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6174719 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6174720 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6174721 i told everyone on twitter last night that i would not be blogging today but i had a slight change of heart
6174722 do innovating firms perform better evidence from academic research on the topic is certainly equivocal it is very hard to find solid evidence that firms that innovate e g obtain more patents perform better
6174723 regular readers know that im a pretty positive and mellow dude
6174724 the demand for leadership development hits me right in the face every day
6174725 for those who dont notice ive withheld patrick williss name from the ballot i was actually quite tempted to include him considering his all world rookie season however i elected to withhold his name barring a barrage of complaints in the comments we included frank gore in the running back vote in part because he had put together more than just one good season im actually feeling rather conflicted on this if enough people want willis included id certainly be willing to reset the vote but i think for now its fine my thought on this is that in the coming years as eligible candidates arise we can reopen some of these votes for instance if gore starts setting career 49ers records we would definitely consider him in the ballot versus roger craig as with patrick willis and others id love to hear peoples thoughts on this
6174726 there appears to be some movement of russian troops out of gori

6174731 due to significant marketplace and economic changes gm and navistar have decided not to renew the memorandum of understanding to purchase gms medium duty truck business which has expired
6174732 gm will continue to run the medium duty business as it has in the past including providing sales service and marketing support to gm dealers for its medium duty trucks gm will continue to review strategic options for the business including continued discussions with navistar
6174733 weve retained the medium duty truck line which we think will be good for flint
6174734 we wanted to retain our work cal rapson uaw international vice president worked hard to maintain that work
6174735 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6174736 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6174737 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6174738 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6174739 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6174740 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 per cent of the citys need for electricity
6174741 want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful offshore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can

6174750 nuestros abogados presentaron ayer ante la comisi n de justicia de la fpf la denuncia contra la directiva de alianza lima por inducir al jugador a abandonar la instituci n chimbotana y esperamos que haya una sanci n ejemplar para evitar que se repitan este tipo de situaciones
6174751 el pueblo chimbotano es muy amable y si jayo defiende con orgullo la camiseta del jos g lvez la hinchada lo aplaudir y pedir que contin e en la instituci n eso depende nicamente del jugador

6174753 there are so many talented players here you guys have great technique im sure i can do some good work
6174754 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6174755 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6174756 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6174757 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6174758 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6174759 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
6174760 because it was devoted to the actual tactics as the cia people were demanding a golden shield that would protect them from later prosecutions and only a memo approving specific tactics could do that
6174761 he read and was horrified by torture memos after he was put in charge of the olc and long before he wrote the transfer memo he is convicted out of his own mouth
6174762 his goldsmiths admission that he read the second still secret memo that detailed specific interrogation techniques being used by the cia makes it flatly impossible that he did not know or suspect what was going on when he wrote the transfer memo
6174763 was used to facilitate the ghost detainee program in which various prisoners were hidden from the international red cross so that nobody would learn that they were prisoners
6174764 and contrary to the geneva conventions i gather their status health and whereabouts were not disclosed to their families
6174765 by not formally accusing them in any judicial way we could according to goldsmith transfer them out of iraq because formally they were not yet accused persons although in fact our government had already accused and convicted them every way but sideways this is true dissembling this is true reliance on minimal form over gigantic substance and this is exactly what jack goldsmith did in his memo of march 19 2004
6174766 until the time came to garner publicity in september 2007 for his new book
6174767 goldsmith was an enabler of evil including evil and crime justified by the tortured rationalizations of lawyers who set out to provide legal cover for torture for cruelly inhuman conduct and other horrors
6174768 whether lawyers in order to justify and provide a basis for supporting vicious and illegal actions of the government are free to assert the most outlandish arguments in favor of these actions are free to invent astonishing even evil arguments in favor of the positions are free to facilitate the governments evil actions and not to counsel against the positions even though the positions and actions are in violation of domestic criminal laws in violation of international law contrary to the american constitutional system and taken without consideration of the traditions and values of this country
6174769 gravely illegal conduct in this way would be subject to disbarment subject to criminal prosecution and disqualified from being on any respectable law school faculty
6174770 i feel that me and um i dont even know his na

6174775 i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6174776 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6174777 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6174778 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6174779 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6174780 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6174781 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6174782 im on the track hes in the water we cant compare too much hes the best in what he do

6174785 his feat is unparallaled just for the fact that he had to face so many hurdles the environment that time was very different india was trying to stand in its feet having just gained independence five years back there was no encouragement for a sportsperson
6174786 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6174787 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6174788 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6174789 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6174790 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6174791 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6174792 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results
6174793 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6174794 through these calling cards the customer can make long distance calls from telephone of any access provider the consumer can subscribe to any access provider and still not be dependent on that provider for long distance calls
6174795 the meeting was negative it was an eyewash no good intention was expressed it depends on their strategy they are not willing to deliver the goods

6174797 two centuries ago newspapers so dominated the traffic carried by postal services accounting for about 95 of the weight but at the same newspapers provided only about 15 of the postal revenues
6174798 communications service providers do have a problem but it is not that of a flood of video instead it is the erosion of their main revenue and profit source voice
6174799 i got a kick out of my mii because it looks like he has a lot of fun on the pitch and hes capable of pulling off some wild moves
6174800 its fun to take control of my character and blast outrageous shots on goal with a flick of the wrist
6174801 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6174802 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist

6174807 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6174808 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6174809 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6174810 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6174811 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6174812 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6174813 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6174814 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6174815 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6174816 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6174817 were aiming to win more championships and looking forward to getting off to a great start this fall

6174829 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6174830 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6174831 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6174832 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6174833 but it is not the fact that it repeats sections verbatim over and over or that it wasnt exactly proofread before it went out

6174848 i would certainly feel that the whole process is demeaning and i would be concerned about what sort of rates of pay are being offered if no irish people want to do the jobs
6174849 to me its highly reminiscent of apartheid in south africa and the usa before civil rights i think nightclub owners might think of doing this in a more sensitive way and maybe redeploy the people in areas which are less demeaning

6174856 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6174857 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6174858 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6174859 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects
6174860 for example seafood is one of the few wild foods still consumed by large numbers of people though we know that the mercury found in marine fish and shellfish poses a threat to humans not to mention the ecosystem itself we know very little about the physical and geochemical processes that link mercury in the atmosphere to the toxic form found in seafood
6174861 fate and bioavailability of mercury in aquatic ecosystem and effects on human exposure
6174862 science should inform regulatory and public health decisions about issues such as the accumulation of mercury in our environment

6174900 our position is that we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security

6174906 it is only a matter of time before the growing army of unemployed and underemployed turns from restless to violent
6174907 about 80 percent of the pacifics population growth is found in the low growth group of islands where employment is rare and living standards are not rising
6174908 but even high guest worker numbers of 50 000 a year for australia and 25 000 for new zealand would not help the employment problems of papua new guinea fiji and the solomon islands
6174909 the pacific can only avoid looming economic social and political crises if its large economies dramatically reform their policies to encourage substantial employment creating growth
6174910 more than two million men four out of five are unemployed in towns or underemployed in villages
6174911 it was more like the spanish inquisition or the salem witch trials than a reasoned hearing by the so called highest court in the land
6174912 the whole purpose was to discredit new zealand first and marginalise winston peters
6174913 he checked his records yesterday and found this was indeed the case
6174914 i think winston has lost all credibility and he is making up a new story every day to fit the facts
6174915 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6174916 do be very careful of what you say in my presence i have put up with a great deal of your boorish bad manners in the last year and i have decided this is the last warning you are going to get i brought you to my palace this morning because you made statements last night in the presence of foreign dignitaries and they found your statements both outrageous and even treasonous they came to me to tell me of such things this from people who are not even my subjects i am inclined to think you are only stupid dont glare lord garver because treasonous is not entirely out of the question yet since that is the other choice am i clear on this lord garver
6174917 everyone hears about the consumer side of an interaction gone bad

6174922 dark gray water big storm clouds reminded me of a song by a band called brand new called crack the sky its about shipwreck as a metaphor for love

6174930 a trade in of test equipment to us prevents it from ending up in a landfill where it could be harmful to the environment plus our customers can save money on the test equipment they need today or in the future
6174931 we also take in non functional test equipment to supplement our extensive parts inventory which ensures we have the parts needed to repair models that are no longer supported by the original manufacturer we are always careful to use appropriate asset refurbishment repair and disposal methods as recommended by federal state and local authorities

6174948 with todays order the fcc acted to protect the rights of internet users and set the precedent that unreasonable discriminatory behavior like comcasts will not be tolerated
6174949 it agreed with public interest advocates and technical experts that comcasts conduct violated fcc principles and was not reasonable network management
6174950 we reiterate our call for a fifth fcc internet principle preserving non discrimination
6174951 while the commissions order sets a strong precedent internet service providers still interfere with customers traffic the commission and the public must keep a watchful eye on isps to ensure that these practices cease and that other discriminatory practices do not take their place
6174952 most often you meet als patients who slur their speech
6174953 hes been housebound the only way out is the stairs
6174954 none of my friends knew i had als but i e mailed a poem to frank and said it was written by a fellow als patient he e mailed me back and scolded me pretty hard for not telling him about it
6174955 telling him that trevor and i were measuring the porch to build a ramp and frank said you are going to let your friends do it for you
6174956 i argued with him for three weeks before i accepted i hate the idea of not being able to do it myself but it has definitely been a blessing it is amazing their compassion their love they are great friends

6174961 its all about wayne all of a sudden these people show up and we havent seen them for 35 years
6174962 wayne was always quiet and he never had a mean bone in his body i never heard him say anything bad about anybody hes the type of person if a neighbor came down with a sickness wayne would help him
6174963 i knew wayne came down with this illness and if i was in his shoes id want friends to come around me he comes out in his wheelchair and watches us and laughs
6174964 people who know wayne really like him and said if they cant be here theyll send a check
6174965 the important thing is connecting with wayne its about togetherness and relationships wayne has always been a really good person
6174966 anything i can do to advocate for als im there in a heartbeat i dislike it when people put a happy face on a disease als destroys the people around you the family doesnt escape its hard going through this but even harder to watch the family going through this

6175020 robinho nunca dijo que no disfruta en el madrid pero el hecho es que tiene una oferta econ mica m s interesante es solamente eso
6175021 s tengo que decir que hasta el 31 de agosto todo es posible hasta que no se cierre el plazo de fichajes no damos el asunto por cerrado robinho recula y acepta viajar con el real madrid para jugar ante el valencia
6175022 stronger tie in to the historical narrative that originally inspired me to make this version in the first place
6175023 somewhat ambiguous juxtaposition of this mythical game and the historical events of september 11th
6175024 a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power
6175025 a lot of the smaller players will have a tough time surviving long term in the solar space
6175026 music is the art which is most nigh to tears and memory
6175027 ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever
6175028 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
6175029 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we
6175030 and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even we think so
6175031 hes still good but hes not the liriano we saw before the surgery his stuff is probably 3 to 4 miles per hour less than what it used to be the changeup is pretty much the same speed but the slider and the fastball are not the same dont get me wrong hes still good but hes not that wow he was before hes not as electric hes not as intimidating but hes still a good useful no 3 4 starter type and thats not a bad thing
6175032 dieser rekord bedeutet mir viel viel mehr als der ber 100 meter
6175033 wir haben vor allem an der ausdauer gearbeitet nachrangig an der schnelligkeit
6175034 weil mein coach ja darauf dr ngt ich will das aber so lange wie m glich hinaus z gern
6175035 the possibility of fay reaching hurricane strength is becoming smaller now that fay is moving northward along the coast and is not expected to move more than 30 nm offshore during the next 24 to 36 hours
6175036 pete is honest and independent and never afraid to take a tough stand
6175037 like me he denounces islamic terrorism and supports offshore oil drilling and energy independence pete king is a great congressman and i am proud to call him my friend we need pete king fighting for us in congress
6175038 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6175039 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6175040 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6175041 john mccain can talk all he wants about paris and brittney but i dont have time for that mess
6175042 cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved
6175043 lower quality reduced accessibility reduced efficiency and higher costs particularly where it is linked to increase private for profit delivery
6175044 lets stop pretending that healing the sick is like trading a commodity lets stop diverting doctors energies into unholy bidding wars for jobs they already do
6175045 the planes are still in the air people are scared and are staying indoors
6175046 we think we have the right to decide on the presidency
6175047 we wouldnt want someone to go home leave their waders for a couple of days then go fishing in another watershed
6175048 weve been back a few times to collect some snails and confirm thats what they are
6175049 if they get into the lake they could cause problems with water intakes theyre new to b c and i really dont want to see them spread
6175050 they could affect food webs because they can displace a lot of the animals that the fish feed on or if the fish start to feed only on snails which dont have many nutrients the condition of the fish could be reduced
6175051 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6175052 we want to be on location there are many questions
6175053 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
6175054 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
6175055 theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come
6175056 we really hope this will be successful in not only education our students
6175057 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil

6175059 as always i invite you to write in with any story ideas
6175060 i should be outlining plans for the next book an am if my editor or agent happen to be reading this i really am but its just been such a lovely summer so far otherwise not too much to report spending way too much time at the new whole foods that just opened in tribeca been there every day for the last five playing with the dogs and alternately shaking my head at the masses lined up 10 deep to buy an iphone and wishing i were one of them oh yeah and outlining constantly outlining as always i invite you to write in with any story ideas youll get zero acknowledgement sic credit and ill vehemently deny taking your idea but if you dont mind that send away xxx
6175061 no just joking wouldnt that be funny if oh but if youre serious
6175062 i bet that girl has a tough time finding cute tops that dont make her look like peyton manning in a baby tee
6175063 were pretty happy that we came up with rather realistic tumor sizes although this is a very basic model it should give researchers a tool to use when deciding if a particular secreted protein would be a good biomarker
6175064 early cancer detection is a very challenging but important goal for the cancer field this modeling work enables a very deep understanding of the problems that will have to be solved for blood based cancer biomarkers to be successful in this effort
6175065 above and beyond the prediction made by performance on neuropsychological tests if you take into account the degree to which the individual varies in their cognitive abilities theres an independent risk of dementia
6175066 the investigators found that relatively brief measures of memory and executive function reassessed annually would allow physicians to predict of dementia before the patient scores in the clearly impaired range
6175067 this study brings us one step closer to a simple safe and reliable test of dementia risk
6175068 our findings do not support the use of b vitamins as secondary prevention in patients with coronary artery disease
6175069 it appears to be consistent that for subjects who have underlying cardiovascular disease and are on multiple medications adding b vitamins on top of a whole host of other medications doesnt appear to provide any further benefit
6175070 it applies only to a very narrow section of the population it doesnt answer the question that were all interested in
6175071 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
6175072 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
6175073 this technique will give us additional information to use in selecting patients that need aggressive treatment
6175074 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes
6175075 consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia
6175076 because when you think about it logically the reason were living longer is because were healthier and if were healthier at any given age then were less likely to be disabled
6175077 all the nursing homes will choke as more and more people spend much more time disabled
6175078 but in reality that hasnt really worked out to be the case
6175079 this is very good news that i can give to some very old people
6175080 i can tell my elderly patients that their chances of being able to take care of themselves 10 years from now is the same as it is now
6175081 as i like to say the older you get the healthier youve been
6175082 so getting to 100 really is a survival phenomenon and people who get there necessarily have to have been disability free not only in their early 90s but pretty much for the vast majority of their lives
6175083 given widespread exposure to inorganic arsenic from drinking water worldwide elucidating the contribution of arsenic to the diabetes epidemic is a public health research priority with potential implications for the prevention and control of diabetes
6175084 it is prudent to minimize arsenic exposures while its effect on metabolic diseases continues to be researched
6175085 medicare web site is somewhat difficult for people to use
6175086 when e health tools are designed designers really have to think about a broad and inclusive group of users and what their needs and abilities are
6175087 we really have to think who we are designing these web sites for what their needs are and what their capabilities are
6175088 we cant assume that everyone has a sophisticated level of computer skills
6175089 without that information we question the usefulness of the study
6175090 cms has worked to organize and format these tools in a consumer friendly manner by conducting both qualitative and quantitative research of the web site tools with multiple audiences
6175091 the information gathered from testing is used to make improvements to the web site our research is ongoing and the web site continues to make enhancements on an incremental basis
6175092 it would be nice to have an administration more committed to people understanding what their rights are
6175093 the administration could provide better quality services with more accuracy
6175094 in fairness its also true that congress and the bush administration has made so much of medicare so complex that even folks with the best of intentions are going to be misdirecting consumers
6175095 its absolutely true that the complexity that president bush has brought to medicare during his two terms in office has been unfortunate
6175096 this technique is really the first time that cancer surgeons can see structures that are otherwise invisible providing true image guided surgery if were able to see cancer we have a chance of curing it
6175097 the 2008 report shows some states and communities have taken positive steps but overall we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the seriousness it deserves
6175098 this is the fifth annual report and with each and every year we see more evidence the obesity epidemic is gaining speed and destructive force
6175099 the resources devoted to improving the health of our families and our children remain too few and too ineffective
6175100 the federal government continues to cut its own effective programs at the federal level the only obesity number going down is the number of dollars being spent to end the epidemic
6175101 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america
6175102 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between enlarged prostate and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the precise mechanism of action by which pde5 inhibitors may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
6175103 the findings presented here offer important information related to bone health for premenopausal women undergoing adjuvant endocrine therapy
6175104 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6175105 i have to laugh at this because to mccain this is all new fangled witchery i hope someone puts in a

6175107 will we ever know whether we are watching a real person in the future
6175108 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
6175109 pushes drinking into hiding heightening its risks including risks from drunken driving and it prevents us from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

6175133 nas exumas que usamos como cen rio em ambos os filmes foi muito dif cil mas inacreditavelmente organizado
6175134 deveria ter sido muito mais confuso do que foi n s voltamos tr s vezes quela loca o para finalizar o trabalho e foi uma equipe extraordin ria que realmente conseguiu isso os departamentos de transporte e de marinha mais uma vez colocaram duas enormes barca as ao largo da praia de white cay como acampamento base e n s levamos o elenco e a equipe at a ilha em pequenas embarca es a equipe encarou o desafio e respondeu muito bem a tudo
6175135 o dubl s tiveram que se pendurar em uma corda de 46 metros de comprimento m o a m o enquanto alternavam as pernas que se prendiam na corda conforme eles se moviam as exig ncias f sicas j eram extremas mas o que n o previmos foram o mau tempo e o mar agitado n o estamos falando s de ondas estamos falando de um mar raivoso imprevis vel muito agitado o mar ficou turbulento demais para os barcos de apoio a pr pria corda balan ava para cima e para baixo a quase 3 metros as condi es n o podiam ter sido piores acabamos usando outra embarca o que tinha cobertura para resgatar os dubl s da corda a cobertura teve que ser refor ada j que n o foi projetada para suportar o peso de pessoas os dubl s tiveram que sincronizar a transfer ncia da corda para a cobertura do barco a cenas de a o de verdade foram feitas longe das c meras naquela noite
6175136 preste bastante aten o nessa cena voc nunca mais ver um filme desta escala de novo logo tudo ser feito com tela azul isto a hist ria do cinema acontecendo agora
6175137 porque desde que come amos a filmar eu fiz uma pe a no west end e um musical na broadway entre o trabalho nos filmes piratas sempre bom voltar rever os amigos ficar alguns dias ou semanas depois ir embora e fazer outra coisa
6175138 isso quer dizer que as pessoas ficavam contentes de me ver quando eu chegava
6175139 tenho muita admira o pela equipe eu trabalhei com a maioria nos tr s filmes e sua energia nunca diminui e nem o entusiasmo e a criatividade de gore no set desta enorme m quina gore sempre acha tempo para os atores e para as interpreta es porque ele sabe que no fim das contas nisso que o p blico se concentra em um filme deste tamanho e com este sucesso n o h como ser complacente como fazer um musical em que n o existe espa o para cinismo n s rimos muito em piratas mas quando come vamos o trabalho era pra valer
6175140 para o empress n s partimos da id ia de que o capit o sao feng se parecia com um pav o
6175141 ent o h elementos no barco que refletem isso tais como os arcos longos que parecem formar uma cauda na traseira do barco e as extens es de velas nas laterais do barco que s o como asas que ajudam a direcionar o barco
6175142 necess rio um excelente artes o para construir um barco como o empress
6175143 o nico problema foi que por eu ter nascido em uma fam lia de fazendeiros eu nunca andei de barco ent o quando eu estava no empress eu ficava enjoado assim que embarcava embora seja um belo barco eu n o tive nenhum sentimento especial porque eu estava tonto demais
6175144 que podemos perceber no enorme globo que est em sua cabine semelhante ao grande mapa do mundo que ele tem em seu escrit rio em port royal sobre a mesa de beckett na cabine vemos r plicas de navios e instrumentos de navega o que intencionalmente se parecem com instrumentos de tortura ele n o s tem o mundo em um torno como tamb m quer esfol lo
6175145 voc fica em um barco por 10 12 14 horas por dia
6175146 n o h como fugir e se isolar voc est em um barco com outras cem pessoas e todas est o tentando fazer o filme da melhor maneira poss vel eles nos mantinham ocupados com muita gua e comida levavam caixas de mantimentos para os navios mas n o d para controlar o mar que te sacode pra l e pra c voc fica mentalmente atordoado e no final volta para o hotel acorda oito horas depois e come a tudo de novo e at de noite na cama ou sentado diante do computador continua balan ando como estar em uma montanha russa
6175147 a coisa mais terr vel de se filmar no mar que voc est acostumado a fazer seu trabalho sentar se de vez em quando e talvez tomar um caf ou ler um pouco
6175148 mas sempre que voc se senta em algum lugar no p rola negra algu m pede licen a e diz com licen a preciso tirar este canh o daqui ou espere preciso despejar sangue neste cara ent o voc acaba ficando 10 horas por dia circulando no barco como um gato tentando achar um lugar para ficar exaustivo

6175152 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
6175153 as part of general international law and customary international law
6175154 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
6175155 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
6175156 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
6175157 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
6175158 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
6175159 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
6175160 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
6175161 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water
6175162 fundamental doctrine of the constitution to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature
6175163 determine the existence of any threat to the peace or act of aggression and if necessary take military or other actions to restore international peace and stability
6175164 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
6175165 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
6175166 don joins our team at an exciting time for allstate and will help us reinvent protection and retirement for the consumer
6175167 don is a highly talented leader who brings to allstate the right mix of business and financial expertise and leadership skills he is results oriented and has been successful in balancing good stewardship with decisive action his financial acumen in a range of corporate settings demonstrated management skill and significant experience working with key stakeholders make him ideally suited for the role of allstates chief financial officer
6175168 dons broad base of experience and leadership in combination with our strong financial team will help us continue our focus on creating shareholder value
6175169 im honored and energized to join such a capable management team at allstate
6175170 allstate is a prime example of how financial strength and a passion for innovation can be combined for the good of the consumer and i look forward to helping the organization advance that strategy
6175171 i am grateful to sam pilch for his strong contribution as acting cfo during this transition period
6175172 the fact that we were able to smoothly and seamlessly manage this transition speaks to the strength of our finance organization and the depth of our management team
6175173 increase intensity and the number of colours that can be displayed and is easier to view in natural light
6175174 we believe that the suffering many people associate with this condition is best addressed by a careful objective scientific analysis
6175175 weve basically gotten such lip service from the cdc for so long that i would not know if they were being sincere
6175176 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6175177 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6175178 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6175179 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6175180 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6175181 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6175182 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6175183 tds received by companies has increased to rs 22 128 crore from rs 13 782 crore during the corresponding period april july 2007 08
6175184 our preferred alternative is to allow stocking to continue in up to 42 lakes with non reproducing populations of trout the sticking point is that we dont have the legal authority to allow that in order for us to implement that alternative we need congress to give us that authority
6175185 all the fish in these lakes were put there by man and that is anathema to many in the park service
6175186 i think the park service is clearly moving the responsibility for this from themselves to congress we dont see a need for congressional approval but we are more than willing to work to accomplish that
6175187 im passionate about the mountains the wilderness and being in that country
6175188 to me thats the ultimate expression of fishing being in the best setting in the world theres no loud motors no boats its an experience you cant have in a lowland lake
6175189 the park was clearly established with a different mandate and now the park service wants to change that
6175190 they promised fish stocking would be allowed the study documents that we can have fisheries that allow us to maintain native species
6175191 if those compromises werent made there might not be a park today
6175192 it certainly is no secret that there are folks both inside and outside the park service that are concerned wherever were not adhering to our policies whether its fish stocking or something else because of impacts for not only one park but others as well
6175193 i understand why some people say they felt there were commitments in the past its unfortunate that those commitments were not codified in the law its a difficult situation because of the confused 40 year history of the issue
6175194 we believe that by providing biologically based fisheries we can reduce the impacts on native biota maximize the growth rate of the fish and the two are linked and provide a quality fishery in a wilderness setting that is unique
6175195 the science indicates there would be a coexistence between fish management and ecological prudence then suddenly the park needs an act of congress to violate their own policy its only a policy there is no law that says they cannot stock those lakes
6175196 congress has been quite clear in saying it expects the park service to adhere to and be consistent in using our policies
6175197 park service policies have been the subject of some degree of controversy over the last few years and the subject of extensive hearings and oversight
6175198 on kind of an intellectual level its an interesting intersection of social values where conflict exists among those who share common goals the love of the outdoors the love of north cascades the love of wilderness
6175199 we are going to retain our policy of all female cabin crew on international flights also
6175200 the need to reduce deficit was initially for reducing the crowding out effect but now it is needed to control inflation also
6175201 the option of increasing revenue through indirect taxes is virtually impossible
6175202 the alternate revenue mobilisation option can only come through direct taxes
6175203 we are in consultation with trai and a final decision will be taken on thursday
6175204 quality and productivity have improved manifold in maruti suzuki in the last few years let us now channelise it to the next level where we become the exclusive base to manufacture small cars for europe
6175205 we now want to take it to 2 lakh cars annually by 2010 11 exports will enable the company to be at the frontier of technology quality and manufacturing excellence
6175206 the company has taken a decision to develop its in house capability with the support of suzuki in line with this the numbers of engineers will be scaled up to 1000 by 2010 the company will also set up an r amp d centre and test track at par with the facility at suzuki japan
6175207 the commodity exchanges would be required to divest foreign equity equal to the amount by which the cap was being exceeded
6175208 mr gambari said mr ban ki moon will visit burma in the last week of december this year and he said this mr ban trip is only about political issue
6175209 however this doesnt mean that the regime has to sit pretty until december rolls around they do really need to show that they are willing to engage in reforms and to make that dialogue with mr ban meaningful they can for example release all political prisoners now and stop attacking people in eastern burma
6175210 an engine failure in itself should not lead to the loss of an aircraft
6175211 all aircraft are designed to be able to cope with an engine failure even on takeoff the aircraft should be able to either stop on the runway or continue its takeoff safely using the remaining engine

6175218 yaghor used to be a member of the old shattered hand clan he took out his own eye with a rusty dagger during a ceremony to prove his worth and to raise in ranks the other two orcs who wished to achieve the same thing failed however and died a slow awful death yaghor became one of the top ranked assassins of his clan using his pets to do most of his work making him the ideal killer he could use the venom from his scorpids to envenom his weapons or his arrows or use a swift creature to hunt down yaghors prey easily being able to track down his targets made the job even easier those days in the shattered hand are over now however now he does almost everything to get a quick buck he enjoys the hunt for his targets still but he put this on a sidetrack he may change his mind though if the price is right he joined up with the sixty thieves a criminal organization mugging people is what they do best gladly taking some precious golden coins from unfortunate people the members are never called by their real names instead each member gets his own nickname yaghor got the nickname patch because he now wears an eye patch where his eye used to be
6175219 we are not pulling out and pulling back troops behind this administrative border into the territory of south ossetia

6175221 south ossetia and abkhazia are part of georgia and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6175222 over the last seven days theyve promised three times to leave but theyve yet to fulfill their promises

6175251 it was running over the top of them and there was no water when he went in
6175252 we quit keeping track of the damages at 180 000 and that didnt even go into a lot of the hand tools
6175253 weve been through it before and we were a little better prepared this time
6175254 as bad as it is i still consider us pretty lucky
6175255 if we would have had another 8 or 10 ft then basically my building would have disappeared under water

6175257 one of my fears was that in 1993 the cell phones went down
6175258 this year we didnt have that problem so we were still in good communication with everybody the inconvenience has been having to relocate our office temporarily

6175264 due to increased demand and focus on water efficiency the emerging water and energy conservation market has the potential to revitalize not only the plumbing industry but also traditional construction and small businesses across the country at a time when most small business owners are suffering because of tough economic times
6175265 it is our suggestion that additional testing and analysis be performed to evaluate the compatibility of the existing water and sewer infrastructure
6175266 at this time there are concerns that americas existing infrastructure cannot handle the water efficient products being considered testing and analysis should be performed for both residential and commercial systems before mandates for high efficiency toilets or other ultra low water consumption products are adopted
6175267 what i hope to demonstrate today is that going green with new hvacr equipment can have a positive impact on the bottom line for home owners small businesses and the overall economy
6175268 the potential for americas small businesses and the hvacr contractors that service those small businesses for job creation economic growth and environmental protection are limitless

6175310 it is just not good enough that some parents are going without out the maintenance they need to bring up their children
6175311 but i would also urge those parents to work with us to keep the lines of communication open
6175312 they should give us whatever information they can to help track down and secure payments from those parents who evade and avoid their responsibility
6175313 it reflects the type of enquiries weve had from lone parents since the agency has existed basically it means money isnt getting to children who need it
6175314 that causes poverty it traps lone parents on benefits and stops them getting into work and lets non resident parents away with their responsibilities of maintaining children
6175315 if students are at risk of being permanently excluded we avoid that by putting them on an agreed transfer to another school for four to five weeks
6175316 if that doesnt work then permanent exclusion goes ahead so its a last chance and a change of scene often helps
6175317 we saw a 31 reduction in permanent exclusions in that cluster last year
6175318 we are looking at rolling that out across the county because we can see it having a positive impact
6175319 i have listened to two medway head teachers and the authority
6175320 the refusal of police forces to provide basic information on the use of taxpayers money is difficult to understand
6175321 it is not as if we have been asking for operational details on the informants used by the police which understandably should remain as confidential information
6175322 but surely the public is entitled to a rough idea on the amount of public money spent on informants in the interests of transparency
6175323 that highlights the dangers there are when an informant is paid for information
6175324 there is scrutiny of this process there will be records within each agency making payments to sources but there is no centrally aggregated figure
6175325 it is open to chief officers to make details of payments made to sources available to the police authority and for the police authority to scrutinise the payments made to sources as part of its audit and assurance responsibilities
6175326 i did not realise that the metropolitan police authority could scrutinise these accounts and i will be requesting that they do it is unbelievable that these payments do not get scrutinised in some way by a publicly accountable body
6175327 there is a global figure for the amount spent on the security services which is going up but we would not break it down into what is spent on covert human intelligence sources
6175328 it is part of the governments over arching policy not to discuss the details of such matters
6175329 the police ought to be open about it and if they think that its a justified use of taxpayers money they should tell us how much they have spent if they have got nothing to hide they should be open about it
6175330 it is a murky and complex and unsavoury world most of these people lie for a living the trick is to find the lie and the truth
6175331 its quite likely that the spending is going up as the police become more focused on organised crime and terrorism but you just dont know
6175332 even if there is a trend the question is are they getting value for money for that spending
6175333 even someone like me who has been on the receiving end fully believes that the public has a duty to help the police with providing crime intelligence
6175334 but can it be right for police officers to have the power to induce with public funds one suspect to give evidence against another suspect who the police officer thinks is the most guilty

6175366 we met with the minister michael mcgimpsey last week on all of this and the minister agreed with us that people need to see the money in their pay packets
6175367 the government rushed into ill thought out reform when the system didnt work they changed it
6175368 these are the kind of costs that result from endless reorganisations not one penny contributes to the health of patients
6175369 inevitably there will be short term costs as a result of reorganisation and it is right that nhs staff who are made redundant get what they are contractually and legally entitled to
6175370 the sbc will be funded from within existing budgets and will be supported by scottish government staff and use existing offices
6175371 mr jenkins will receive a daily allowance as chair of 387 based on that paid to the chair of the previous administrations cultural commission but members of the commission will be unremunerated
6175372 the cultural commission budget was around 500 000 while a similar figure has been set for the scottish broadcasting commission budget it is expected that the commissions overall spend will be less as the timescale is to be quicker and speedier as agreed with the commission chair blair jenkins
6175373 it is absolutely astonishing that the snp believe this is the best use of half a million pounds of taxpayers money
6175374 the snp are paying hundreds of thousands of pounds to fund their commission set up to look at something they have no responsibility for while at the same time they are looking at making cuts to areas that are important to the people of scotland

6175378 we have lots and lots of lunchtime activities where we have equipment available for the students to be able to pick up and do any kind of activity they want

6175380 as a defence lawyer i would say no it wouldnt be a good thing
6175381 but if i wear my citizens hat i would say if you go along to any estate and see the age of kids marauding around like a pack of wolves youd see that reducing the age of criminal responsibility to eight or nine would be vital
6175382 i mean if you look at how children are treated by government and legislation you have to be 18 to be able to vote 16 to have sex and yet 10 to be held accountable for committing a crime
6175383 the best approach to serious child offenders is to deal with them as children who need effective care measures
6175384 on the first occasion an employer of a relatively small computer supplier to the nhs was looking up information about one of his relatives by getting access to a gp medical records system
6175385 then an employee of a hospital trust was using his access to their medical system to look up information about one of his relatives
6175386 my concerns are that they need to put more stringent safeguards in place and also that they need to consider perhaps smaller local databases that actually link up but with explicit patient consent so that would put the patient in control

6175390 this deal with annington means that the mod is contractually obliged to pay rent on the homes occupied by service families

6175394 when youre asking these guys to go out to afghanistan and iraq in a worst case scenario they are giving their lives its very important that the families are in a community together with people who understand what they are going through who can help with their children and who can talk through things

6175411 its like planting a big red flag on the tumor to attract the attention of the bodys immune system which normally ignores cancerous cells
6175412 its a great idea we just dont know how to do it yet
6175413 we will ask the igg antibodies to carry the bacteria derived nucleic acid as a guest throughout the body
6175414 this will allow the nucleic acid to circulate for days which is different from how antibodies have been used in classical targeted delivery
6175415 rapidly growing solid tumors are surrounded by imperfect almost chaotic blood flow
6175416 the tissue is very leaky because of this unusual permeability the antibody nucleic acid complex should become lodged in the tumor periphery this should mimic a local infection which the body will work to eliminate
6175417 with nearly half of all infants in north america being delivered by caesarean section or after episiotomy there is clearly a requirement for pain relief for mothers
6175418 however our study confirms that codeine as a treatment for pain may be unsuitable and cannot be considered safe for all breastfed infants
6175419 the good news is that those breastfeeding children who were exposed to these high levels of morphine showed dramatic improvement once they were taken off the morphine tainted breast milk
6175420 by removing the exposure most children will demonstrate a complete reversal of symptoms and show no long term adverse effects

6175447 sitting down with morrissey was both daunting and exciting he is such an interesting person with strong opinions and immense musical talent he does not mince words when he dislikes something but when he talks about music he respects he is an outspoken fan
6175448 traveling is difficult but the actual moment when you are on stage with your songs is perfect
6175449 at the time when music happens to you and grabs you and jumps on top of you you dont realize that it will stay with you forever you think youll outgrow everything but with music with artists you actually fall in love you fall in love with that moment hearing them and you fall in love with them

6175457 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6175458 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6175459 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6175460 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6175494 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
6175495 this is a message of intolerance and a perfidious scene of ethnic cleansing that was preconceived as a way to drive away people of other ethnicities and religions living in sarajevo
6175496 two such messages circulating by e mail and popping up in comments on blogs for months are reproduced below and annotated and debunked point by point to illustrate the tactics obamas been up against for most of the campaign
6175497 ill get him in a headlock for you miss field and cut off his air so hell open his mouth
6175498 i have to marvel at how similar animals and humans can be neither group likes to be forced into anything and try as i might i cant seem to convince him were trudging toward freedom

6175502 ill take on your watch tonight like we agreed but hickorys getting antsy about having you and your aunt in your own wagon you were last in the row and last to set up camp tonight
6175503 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
6175504 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
6175505 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
6175506 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
6175507 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
6175508 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
6175509 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
6175510 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
6175511 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
6175512 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
6175513 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
6175514 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
6175515 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
6175516 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
6175517 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
6175518 ill clean up and join you in a few moments

6175561 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6175562 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6175563 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6175564 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6175565 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6175566 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6175567 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders

6175570 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6175571 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them

6175577 the u s was not involved in that raid it was an element of one of the iraqi special operations forces do we support it in principle absolutely not
6175578 it was what appears to be a rogue operation its definitely concerning that we have an element that would go do something like that
6175579 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6175580 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations
6175581 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6175582 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6175583 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6175584 he tried to work through it but wasnt able to function very well with it during practice so we decided to go in this direction
6175585 to run a 19 3 hes going to have to run the curve a lot better hes going to have to hold that speed for a very very long time
6175586 thats not the most easy thing to do even for him
6175587 it was the most impressive athletic performance ive ever seen in my life
6175588 michael johnson is a great athlete and he revolutionized the sport
6175589 hes been able to take the long stride he has and been able to coordinate that and achieve a very long stride
6175590 that combination is deadly as the people in the 100 final found out
6175591 i had a few bone fragments floating around in my elbow joint causing inflammation there were also bone spurs that needed to be removed it has been ongoing for a while it reduced my flexibility in the right arm and if it was extended too much it would swell up and be useless for a few days until the inflammation went down
6175592 so it was a priority to get it fixed as soon as this last fight was over which is what we did dr sanders and young operated on it in las vegas on july 10 and removed the bone fragments and bone spurs
6175593 mostly because i am training on it so much but should be completely healed within the next few weeks i have been doing cardio and some grappling but havent been able to spar for some time i am trying to be ready by november but its a safer bet to say i will be fighting in december
6175594 i want to fight top contenders i have already fought burkman and davis so i want to move up from there and continue to test my abilities against the best
6175595 i am extremely motivated and excited to get back in the octagon mentally and physically i will be where i need to be to return to the aggressive explosive fighter that i used to be
6175596 after the okami fight i was immature professionally and let pressure and other issues cloud my mind i know i could have fought better but didnt and it handed me my greatest loss
6175597 after this instead of making up for it with a better fight against burkman i let issues effect that fight as well and again was disappointed in my performance it was a tough lesson to have to swallow but it matured me as a fighter
6175598 you hear of fighters going through a bad time in their career but you never can understand what its like until you go through it yourself its like everything else in that you have to learn as you go and most of the time learn from your mistakes i have definitely learned from mine and i feel have become a more mature complete fighter
6175599 we are fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6175600 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players

6175613 even if i had lost today i think i would have been pretty satisfied with my performance if a bit disappointed
6175614 these are the kind of matches i have been losing in the last year at some point it affects your confidence so to win one like this is good and hopefully i can build from here
6175615 i didnt play any matches for two weeks and i had never played her before so didnt know what to expect
6175616 but it was ok i lost my rhythm a bit on my serve but i fought to the end and i am very pleased with the win
6175617 only the tail was recognisable there was wreckage scattered all over the place and dead bodies across a wide area a lot of them were children
6175618 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6175619 they are pulling out burnt corpses the plane has been completely destroyed
6175620 the planes tail has broken off from the rest of the fuselage its difficult to describe the scene because its just a mess of metal
6175621 i saw how the plane broke in two and a huge explosion
6175622 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgement senator obama has made it clear he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq
6175623 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt thinks it matters whether american wins or loses
6175624 it is important for the service to have the opportunity to point out on the ground exactly what our security requirements are while the event is under way
6175625 people will basically give their first young to get really good access
6175626 it is precisely in issues like this where the interests of the muslims are involved that our muslim religious leaders must be united to promote the welfare of the bangsamoro
6175627 issuing irresponsible and inflammatory statements that deepen the crisis and cause unnecessary conflict among the different religious and ethnic groups in mindanao

6175866 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6175867 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6175868 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6175871 i started the site dkos for a simple reason i felt ill served by the undemocratic gatekeeping mentality so prevalent in our society and at that time we seemed to be on an inexorable march toward war with no avenue for dissent there was an assumption by the powers that be that the rest of the citizen body couldnt think for ourselves that we needed self appointed and so called experts to tell us what to think what to do and what we should or should not know for far too long these gatekeepers controlled the national conversation
6175872 when your enemies begin to notice you and attack you you have arrived instead of avoiding confrontation with gatekeepers and opponents embrace it and feed it stoking the flames of controversy brings visibility to your issues raises your profile and effectiveness and begins a cycle of ever increasing attention that you can use to your advantage

6175888 i have an insatiable curiosity and the net provides answers to everything any question boom there is your answer i love that google is god ask it a question boom
6175889 do you spend more time than you think you should surfing the net yes
6175890 do you have time limiting your time on the net yes
6175891 do you derive pleasure and satisfaction in life from being on the net
6175892 if i have the opportunity to go somewhere i think about whether there is internet access when i moved here the first thing about the property i wanted to know was does it have comcast cable location schools property taxes who cares does it have comcast cable
6175893 anywhere i go i would find access if it was a vacation it would annoy people i am on vacation with but i have to have it

6175901 in general it is a pre occupying repeated unpredictable set of stimuli that people view over and over and it captivates them and takes them out of the world the best way to define a problem when it interferes with your life the balance of your life that is the time you spend time on the net that takes you away from the life you live when it comes to work and relationships if they are compromised then the net is a significant problem
6175902 we have no idea how many are involved this is an area that is relatively new and trying to understand how it affects society
6175903 if you think you have a problem seek help i would begin by seeing your doctor who could refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist or pastor or social worker depending on whom is available if a person spends much time on the net they could be escaping from stuff in their life that is uncomfortable i think talking about it is good

6175937 often referred to as intrinsically safe lights fluorescent lights are popular in paint spray booths because fluorescent lights provide even lighting and more consistent true color
6175938 while our explosion proof fluorescent lights continue to be popular with oil rigs and aerospace companies as surface mount lights we have seen more and more paint booth operators working to bring their shops compliant with osha requirements we offer explosion proof fluorescent lights that can be mounted on the ceiling or on carts with wheels in this way the operators can either work with overhead lighting or position these hazardous location fluorescent lights to illuminate specific portions of the painted pieces
6175939 we think we offer one of the best values in the industry our explosion proof paint spray booth lights are certified to ul 844 for hazardous locations ul 595 and 1598 as waterproof lights for marine and saltwater applications and ul 924 which covers the use of these intrinsically safe lights as emergency lights we have recently added a second ballast to our existing fluorescent fixtures that enables them to operate not only as a work area light in the paint spray booth but also offer 90 minutes of emergency lighting in the event of power loss our explosion proof fluorescent light offers dual duty as a functional work light and an explosion proof emergency light saving the paint spray booth operator or the oilfield operator money both in fixtures and installation costs while meeting all the osha requirements for hazardous location lighting to top it off we offer these fixtures made right here in texas under 1000 each and usually with less than 2 weeks lead time
6175940 we really have worked to become a one stop shop for plant maintenance workers oil field operators paint spray booth operators and shipyards who need a variety of explosion proof surface mount and portable lighting

6175942 those who had been riding the upward wave decide now is the time to get out those who thought the rally would last forever find their illusion destroyed abruptly and they also respond to the newly revealed reality by selling or trying to sell and thus the rule supported by the experience of centuries the speculative episode always ends not with a whimper but with a bang
6175943 the truth is that liquidity is the only significant weapon in the central banks arsenal but it will not necessarily go where you want it to go when you need it to go there
6175944 once public opinion is convinced that the increase in the quantity of money will continue and never come to an end and consequently the prices of all commodities will not cease to rise everybody becomes eager to buy as much as possible and restrict his cash holdings to minimum size if the credit expansion is not stopped in time the boom turns to crack up boom the flight into real values begins and the whole monetary system founders
6175945 global monetary policy must tackle inflation even if it is driven by rising food and energy prices
6175946 we are trying to use some monetary instruments to tighten monetary supply but which instruments to use it is not convenient to say
6175947 we never buy stocks when we see prices soaring we buy stocks because were confident of the companys growth people should be cautious when they see prices rising

6175951 the economic dry spell should not mislead us into talking up the danger of recession
6175952 the german and the european economies remain in a robust state discussion about the end of the upturn is misplaced
6175953 the fact that weaker growth rates are expected for the economy in the near future does not mean that enough of a countervailing effect for price stability is taking shape and automatically offsetting the pressure on prices
6175954 you must never delude yourself into thinking that youre investing when youre speculating
6175955 the worst is yet to come the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think having a couple of medium sized and small banks going under are going to do the job like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players among the big investment banks
6175956 a sound banker alas is not one who foresees danger and avoids it but one who when he is ruined is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows so that no one can really blame him
6175957 in most bull markets there comes a time when the public controls fluctuations and the efforts of the largest operators are insufficient to check the rising tide
6175958 the price of oil has fallen 20 in recent days which backs our position that this is not a problem of volume its not a problem of production but rather its linked to speculation
6175959 obviously when the price of crude oil oscillates 20 up or down in such a short time it doesnt have anything to do with production

6175992 innovators feel in any industry when they try to introduce a new idea instead of being thrown a ticker tape parade theyre often met with hostility or indifference sometimes the status quo defeats the innovative concept or at least delays its introduction

6175994 though the technology for digital projection was improving the issue of who would pay for what seemed like it might derail digital cinema
6175995 our ten year plan is to be the worlds leader in that but the way to win is not to focus on the technology its to get the customers a couple million subscribers who are addicted to the internet for choosing their movies those are exactly the people who will do downloading its the customer relationship that will be valuable

6176000 the absolute backbone of not only understanding the property market but understanding markets in general its the most basic of contractual arrangements trust is the element that brings agents and parties together without trust you wont be able to buy or sell this value has been well understood and written about from the time of the classics all the way to today
6176001 solution is to build trust in order to do that reality check analysis can be used to check the reality of the market throughout its history this analysis shows when trust was first broken why it was broken and who gained from the breach of that trust you have to ask the correct questions so that they can lead you to the right answers
6176002 they have discovered the source of momentum and with it the beginnings of a smarter way to exceptional growth managers often talk about riding the wave momentum leaders arent that passive they live by this motto first build your wave then ride it
6176003 yeah youve got reasonable growth but its nothing exceptional youre a safe bet nothing more okay i might tell my mom to buy but then shes happy with inflation plus one the way we see it youre really grinding it out we reckon the strains getting harder too theres no impetus no momentum

6176007 why doesnt education focus on what humans can do better than the machines and instruments they create
6176008 education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth learning can be taught

6176010 when did you last teach a course in a subject that existed when you were a student

6176100 leah nells will tell us about some of the major pharaohs of ancient egypt leah
6176101 the pharaohs were the kings of egypt and they ruled in families called dynasties the pharaohs were not the only the political rulers of egypt but they were also the religious rulers as well were treated like gods by their people and it was believed that when they died they went to live with their gods in the afterlife most pharaohs were men but there were some women who were pharaohs too
6176102 three of the most famous pharaohs were ramesses the second tu tutenkhamun and cleopatra ramesses the second also known as ramesses the great was egypts most famous and powerful pharaoh he was the pharaoh for sixty six years and he is the pharaoh who moses fled from in the bible he constructed a lot of famous buildings and monuments that still stand today
6176103 tuten also known as king tut wasnt really that important but we know a lot about him because his tomb was discovered in 1922 with the mummy and other objects still inside some people say that his tomb was cursed because a lot of people who helped discovered it died mysteriously he became the pharaoh when he was only eight years old and he died when he was only eighteen he might have been murdered but no one knows for sure
6176104 cleopatra was not the first female pharaoh to rule egypt but she is the most famous she became pharaoh when she was only seventeen she fell in love with both julius caesar and mark antony when she she was bit by a snake she was trying to commit suicide
6176105 when a pharaoh died he or she was buried with all of their belongings sometimes they were buried in pyramids and sometimes they were buried underground the pharaohs believed they became gods after they died when they buried they were buried as mummies they were buried with food and gold and even some of their servants and workers were buried with them the pharaohs were a very important part of egyptian society
6176106 too often in the past our states failure to respond quickly to fiscal crises has only made our budget problems worse and the solutions weve had to implement more painful
6176107 today we are taking a different approach rather than simply hoping that our struggling economy improves all sides worked together in the spirit of cooperation and took action to reduce spending i want to thank my partners in the legislature for working productively with me during this special session
6176108 while todays agreement represents a positive step forward for fiscal responsibility in state government the looming deficit we face next year will demand even more difficult choices and given the significant continued uncertainty within the economy there are no guarantees that we can avoid additional current year spending reductions if revenues plummet even further i will continue to monitor our states finances carefully and will seek additional action if necessary
6176109 the extraordinary session of the state legislature called by the governor to address the fiscal challenges facing new york has been a success because we have worked together to achieve significant savings in this years budget without raising taxes or negatively impacting vital services that new yorkers rely on i applaud the governor for his leadership in focusing new yorkers on this issue and thank the assembly for their partnership
6176110 in this important emergency legislative session the assembly collaborated with governor paterson and the senate to take strong action to address new yorks current economic downturn the assemblys priority was to make necessary cuts and diminish future deficits while still preserving the quality of health care in new york we look forward to partnering with governor paterson and the senate to provide property tax relief for new yorkers while meeting our education commitments and providing home heating assistance for those in most need this coming winter
6176111 weve faced slow downs before and were surely face them again

6176128 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6176129 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6176130 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6176131 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6176132 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6176133 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6176134 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it

6176142 the bbc is not impartial or neutral its a publicly funded urban organisation with an abnormally large number of young people ethnic minorities and gay people it has a liberal bias not so much a party political bias it is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias

6176145 people who know a lot more than i do may be right when they claim that global warming is the consequence of our own behaviour i assume that this is why the bbcs coverage of the issue abandoned the pretence of impartiality long ago

6176150 we are really excited about the schedule we have put together for the 2008 09 season
6176151 we are playing 18 teams that advanced to post season play last year and it should help us prepare for a run in the postseason our nonconference schedule consists of three teams xavier utah and hartford who participated in the ncaa tournament last year and mtsu kentucky and vermont all participated in the wnit i think the early road stint against solid competition will help us prepare for a grueling big east slate

6176153 we appreciate all the fans that came out last season to give us our largest attendance average of over 6500 we hope to set another attendance record this year as well

6176193 the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
6176194 despite the strong headline number for retail sales if you look at it in real terms stripping out the price effects retail sales were actually down
6176195 is consistent with an economy thats just struggling to turn out growth of any variety
6176196 it now looks like gdp gross domestic product managed to eke out a tiny advance in the second quarter
6176197 the underlying story in this retail sales report is consistent with that
6176198 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6176199 what we saw through the second quarter is that exports and manufacturing really pulled up the slack in the economy
6176200 were expecting that to be really the driver of any growth that we see going forward
6176201 the leading indicators for the second month in a row were flat
6176202 signalling modest growth at best in the second half of the year
6176203 well probably see the economy over the next couple of months treading water
6176204 just based on the fact that one of the key sources of support for the canadian economy the u s demand for our goods and services is going to shrink further
6176205 until the u s starts to have a convincing turnaround
6176206 canada is probably going to at the very least tread water if not contract
6176207 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6176208 we have never provided this sort of money for such purposes before
6176209 wij hebben dit probleem aan zien komen toen de bouw van de euroborg aan de orde was
6176210 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6176211 puts on public display the intentions of the ruling portion of the ruling party
6176212 we question the constitutionality of the attempt to fudge the separation of powers between the executive and parliament by making the appointing body of the sabc board the president in consultation with the speaker of the national assembly
6176213 the proposition that an entire board of the sabc can be removed not by due enquiry but merely after a finding of a committee of the national assembly is quite simply outrageous
6176214 hei vamos cantar ao mundo inteiro angola unida um povo livre verdadeiro
6176215 after long debate we decided that those oil contracts should be reconsidered not to be accepted just like that because things have changed the price of oil has changed the regime is new
6176216 we arrived at this consensus that those oil contracts should be reviewed
6176217 concerning the russian contract the former regime had signed it for political reasons and canceled it for political reasons too
6176218 this oil field will be put up for transparent public competition
6176219 some of the companies have said one year is hardly worth the investment
6176220 it appears that in present form they probably wont proceed on most of these or all
6176221 retail sites no longer make customers choose between convenience and price
6176222 its a binary outcome it can go one way or another
6176223 they already have an aging product if these new devices are great the stock price will go up if they are late it will go lower

6176244 but as they enjoy the games from the comfort of their seats at the olympic stadium they should reflect on their failure to speak up for the chinese citizens who built the stadium and their hotels clean their hotel rooms serve their meals or in the case of chinese journalists try to bring them their news
6176245 that is the role of human rights organizations in this respect we are from mars youre from venus
6176246 ge seeks to advance human rights by leading by example through our interactions with customers and suppliers the products we offer and our relationships with communities and governments
6176247 i believe the olympics are a force for good and if they were not a force for good we would not sponsor them
6176248 being a good corporate sponsor of the beijing games has sadly not meant being a good corporate citizen
6176249 the sponsors silence has only emboldened the chinese government and allowed the ioc to ignore the human rights standards it claims to uphold
6176250 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters

6176342 when i joined the subsidy was rs 13 000 crore which has now increased to rs 1 19 000 crore but in last four years not a single penny burden has been imposed on farmers as there was no increase in prices of fertilisers

6176354 the group can say yes to nuclear trade with india if two simple conditions are met first india must sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty a step already taken by 178 other countries and every member state of the nuclear suppliers group after all why should the groups members exempt india from it
6176355 but by closing its manufacturing of new plutonium and highly enriched uranium india would prove to the international community that opening up nuclear commerce would not assist either directly or indirectly its nuclear weapons programme
6176356 already ratcheting up its nuclear weapons programme in an attempt to keep pace with its regional rival
6176357 just last month the pakistani government darkly announced that waiving the nuclear rules for india threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
6176358 the reasons are well known the country has never signed the nonproliferation treaty or the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty it misused civilian nuclear technology to produce its first nuclear weapon in 1974 and it continues to manufacture nuclear weapons to this day

6176361 that depends on how the nsg exemption is worded and so we will have to see how that is worked out
6176362 our hope is to do things expeditiously in the iaea board in the nsg and with some understanding from our congress to move expeditiously there so that theres no question of some people going ahead of others
6176363 we are both trying to make it all work together if there is some difference down the road we will have to discuss it at that time

6176382 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6176383 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6176384 if poland allows elements of the u s missile shield to be placed in its territory it will expose itself to a strike and thats 100 percent sure
6176385 its georgia today ukraine tomorrow and poland may be next

6176425 thirty seven percent of the colleges fleet runs on some form of renewable energy including biodiesel
6176426 using the butter sculpture is a unique way to fuel the esf fleet
6176427 this separates out the triglycerides which will be split in our reactor at esf a process known as transesterification that creates the biodiesel
6176428 dairy farmers are the original environmentalists recycling nutrients and water on their land so it makes sense that this annual tribute to them is itself finding new life in fuel rather than being discarded

6176434 we will ask the igg antibodies to carry the bacteria derived nucleic acid as a guest throughout the body
6176435 this will allow the nucleic acid to circulate for days which is different from how antibodies have been used in classical targeted delivery
6176436 rapidly growing solid tumors are surrounded by imperfect almost chaotic blood flow
6176437 the tissue is very leaky because of this unusual permeability the antibody nucleic acid complex should become lodged in the tumor periphery this should mimic a local infection which the body will work to eliminate

6176444 se c un principio che sottende la visione del mondo di bush cheney che tutti i paesi devono soggiacere agli interessi americani e che non si pu permettere a nessuno di emergere con uno status di potenza quasi alla pari per usare unepressione della quadrennial defence review per il 2006 e questo porta al conflitto giacch molti paesi cercheranno naturalmente di accrescere il loro potere che gli stati uniti lo vogliano o no
6176445 per anni prima dell11 settembre una cricca di ideologi millenaristi di washington aveva predicato la necessit di attaccare liraq gli attentati hanno fornito loro un pretesto adesso temo che possa accadere lo stesso con liran la georgia potrebbe essere il pretesto la politica americana verso liran stata plasmata per decenni dallemotivit non dalla razionalit le emozioni adesso si sprecano a washington gli iraniani non hanno niente a che fare con linvasione russa della georgia spero che non debbano pagarne il prezzo con il sangue
6176446 un rispettato dirigente di un equity fund con sedi in austria e in repubblica ceca che viene da una famiglia di diplomatici mi ha detto la georgia non altro che una portaerei degli stati uniti gli stati uniti pensano ancora secondo i paradigmi della guerra freadd e francamente in ventanni non hanno imparato niente i miei viaggi recenti in georgia abkhazia e ossezia del sud mi confermano la convinzione di molti che gli stati uniti abbiano sofferto un danno irreparabile con il conflitto georgiano gli stati uniti ne risentiranno a lungo adesso pu non sembrare ma mi creda la gente ricorda che gli stati uniti non erano a berlino nel 53 in ungheria nel 56 e in cecoslovacchia nel 68 sono solo parole e niente azioni

6176457 he tomlinson gave us four or five things that basically are in coaching 101 it was all natural stuff to him guys starting to grab him and him getting his hands off so he can get the call things like that through all the experiences hes had hes found out so much of those things
6176458 its a little bit different because the relationship lo and i had we built over time the same thing with mike
6176459 that takes time this group is going to be ok were going to be all right
6176460 i told him were going to bring a lot of young guys in he does a great job with little subtle comments about different situations and what hes looking for
6176461 and i can tell them until im blue in the face but when he sits there and says ok this is what im looking for im looking for the technique of the outside backers i want to see where the safety is those are invaluable things to the young guys
6176462 no matter who it is if he sees something hes going to help you out
6176463 hes really smart he knows whats going on with everybody not only us but if the line does something thats not right he knows what they did wrong thats tough to do to know different positions like that
6176464 i am a guy that has been around for a while now i know a lot of young guys have questions even if they do have questions sometimes they are a little hesitant to ask at that point i just make sure that i always share my knowledge with them

6176468 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6176469 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6176470 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6176471 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6176472 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6176473 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6176474 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket
6176475 if these men are saying and doing things of their own ideas such will die but if such be of god then it will be unstoppable and such would put them in a serious state
6176476 humans are no more born to be hunters than to be gardeners
6176477 we wrote this update to answer some of the criticisms and to provide more evidence for our view of early man as prey
6176478 one major alternative theory that has gained more attention since we wrote the original book is that early man was not a hunter but was a scavenger instead
6176479 we have found that while early man may have done some scavenging it was opportunistic very little of early humans diet came from meat
6176480 not one of the more than 250 living primate species is a scavenger
6176481 once a paradigm becomes established within a scientific community most practitioners become technicians working within the parameters of the theory but rarely questioning the validity of the theory itself
6176482 we are not saying that our theory is absolutely correct and will never be disproven
6176483 but we are saying that the evidence we have today best fits the theory of man the hunted than of man the hunter
6176484 it developed from a basic judeo christian ideology of man being inherently evil aggressive and a natural killer in fact when you really examine the fossil and living non human primate evidence that is just not the case
6176485 most theories on man the hunter fail to incorporate this key fossil evidence
6176486 we wanted evidence not just theory we thoroughly examined literature available on the skulls bones footprints and on environmental evidence both of our hominid ancestors and the predators that coexisted with them
6176487 australopithecus afarensis was probably quite strong like a small ape
6176488 it didnt have the sharp shearing blades necessary to retain and cut such foods
6176489 these early humans simply couldnt eat meat if they couldnt eat meat why would they hunt
6176490 in fact some archaeologists and paleontologists dont think we had a modern systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60 000 years ago
6176491 primates that are edge species even today are basically prey species not predators
6176492 one of the main defenses against predators by animals without physical defenses is living in groups
6176493 in fact all diurnal primates those active during the day live in permanent social groups most ecologists agree that predation pressure is one of the major adaptive reasons for this group living in this way there are more eyes and ears to locate the predators and more individuals to mob them if attacked or to confuse them by scattering there are a number of reasons that living in groups is beneficial for animals that otherwise would be very prone to being preyed upon
6176494 this is just as important an event in someones life when we celebrate the life of someone
6176495 this is my feed from the camera it takes about 30 seconds for the server to accept the incoming media
6176496 to allow a family to have this as an archive in their family history we give the link to the website only to the immediate family
6176497 its not like back in world war two trench fighting this training is about using your brain
6176498 fourth generation warfare is understanding that its not going to be a uniformed force that were going to be fighting
6176499 to me a body language would be something that you would train maybe a lawyer or a business man that would be interested in that
6176500 a person thats agitated a person thats passive or aggressive a person thats mission focused theyre going to give off a certain set of signals and those signals are much better than language
6176501 its everything from transfer evidence like a shoe impression or a tire impression to things like retinal scan and fingerprints to things like human behavior patterns

6176505 especially when youre a kid theres all kinds of conjecture
6176506 the russians came forward and said there were pows from the korean war in russia he could also have been in china or maybe living somewhere in korea for all i knew those were the thoughts of a 12 year old
6176507 i felt he was not coming back and i hoped he wasnt in some camp somewhere or something like that
6176508 scientists used mitochondrial dna and dental comparisons in the identification of the remains
6176509 i cant say enough about those people the ones who go out there in the field and the guy who presented my fathers case to me and especially the forensic guys the guys in hawaii
6176510 i cant even express my appreciation properly for the work they do
6176511 much of other countries initiatives for looking for their missing stemmed from the example this country set
6176512 i think the citizens from other countries see that the american families and public hold the u s accountable to find this nations missing so they are turning to their governments for the same reason

6176541 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer

6176543 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6176544 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6176545 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6176546 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

6176548 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6176551 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6176552 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6176554 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

6176644 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6176645 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6176646 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6176647 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent

6176673 bipartisan cooperation is critical to achieving meaningful reform of transportation policy i look forward to sharing my experiences with elected officials who are concerned about transportation and dedicating my time to this important project
6176674 dennis is a highly respected and highly skilled public servant who brings a wealth of expertise to our project
6176675 his work in detroit and with the national league of cities will be a great asset
6176676 we look forward to having dennis join us in our efforts to reform u s transportation policy in this country
6176677 he will offer us a critical local and state perspective
6176678 he brought invaluable experience and insight to our work having been the governor of virginia where transportation issues were one of his top priorities
6176679 solutions to our transportation challenges and infrastructure needs will require a responsible bipartisan approach and i am pleased that i have had an opportunity to work with the bpc on this project over the past year
6176680 bpcs emphasis on bipartisan problem solving is a great model for how we must work together if we want to begin solving many of our nations biggest challenges dennis archer brings solid experience to the table and i know that as he has done great things for detroit he will do great things for the bpc
6176681 producers said its a nice project a great project where are the white heroes
6176682 i couldnt get the money here i couldnt get the money in britain i went to everybody you wouldnt believe the number of producers based in europe and in the states that i went to
6176683 the first question you get is is it a black film all of them agree its not going to do good in europe its not going to do good in japan
6176684 sergey eisenstein had the same idea anthony quinn had this idea harry belafonte sidney poitier and this goes on
6176685 it is mr glover who should be bringing dollars to venezuela
6176686 the first african films that i saw were films that portrayed africans as savages ignorant and uncivilized and i wanted to know something else
6176687 i was very fortunate i had the chance to read writers like mariama ba aime cesaire and leopold sedar senghor i read him when i was 20
6176688 when i saw sidney poitier on screen i was probably 10 or 11
6176689 that was a different image an image i had never seen before on screen
6176690 the african americans i saw they danced they were buffoons that was the image so sidney brought another image
6176691 i think cinema has played a great role in our re imagining ourselves
6176692 people told me i was too young an inexperienced they said i had only been on the county council but i was far younger and far less experienced than barack obama is now and i did just fine for the people of delaware
6176693 this ambitious goal will rely not only on new hollywood studio partners those who were formerly with hd dvd but also the growing success of the playstation 3 video game system which contains a blu ray player recent reports indicate the ps3 will outsell the rival xbox 360 game system this year
6176694 however if they think it will be such an easy transition from one dominant format to another they have another thing coming many consumers are perfectly content with their standard dvds which cost less and does no require an expensive new piece of hardware to play
6176695 the largest criminal work site enforcement operation ever in the united states
6176696 the difference between them and anybody who is in jail is that in jail the government pays for them but if theyre on the streets we pay for them what kind of a government makes prisoners of 43 mothers who all have children and then says you cant work you cant leave and cant stay that boggles the imagination
6176697 were trying to deal with that immediate shock and what to do with those immediate needs but theres something much more that we have to face and this problem is rooted in a very very poor immigration system and we have to do all that we possibly can for immigration reform

6176700 generalizations can be dangerous because there are different types of non fiction
6176701 how to informational books are easier to break in with if you have subject matter expertise if youre a generalist author youd better have a subject matter expert as a co author or youll have a hard time convincing a publisher to publish you
6176702 in order to succeed these types of books need to tell compelling stories
6176703 they require the same sort of writing skills as fiction to a publisher this sort of work is totally author driven and every bit as risky as publishing fiction
6176704 non fiction has become a strong sophisticated area in many ways non fiction is easier to publish than fiction because it targets a very definable audience and its easier to package books and target them to specific readers
6176705 in fiction were looking for a breakthrough story that will have a long life in trade paperback trade paperback fiction is gaining momentum with excellent literary titles getting broader exposure an unknown writer can break through with a great story for an editor that discovery is still an incomparable thrill
6176706 im told that 95 of the material that agents receive is fiction
6176707 and that they sell 5 of the 5 of non fiction that lands on their desk they sell 95
6176708 we think these actions will lead to more traffic listings and transactions and expect greater ebay and paypal volumes will help offset lost listing fees
6176709 moreover we expect added traffic to be monetized with advertising

6176713 the inspector was able to gain access to the interior of seven of the nine aircraft inspected which is an apparent violation of the airlines security program
6176714 tsa is reviewing the inspection results and depending on the conclusion could take action with the airline up to and including levying of civil penalties
6176715 to look for and test among other things access vulnerabilities or areas were someone with ill intent could gain access to the aircraft
6176716 aircraft operators are required to secure each aircraft when left unattended
6176717 it delayed a lot of folks getting to where they had to go yesterday
6176718 it is not tsas intent to cause delays or potential damage to aircraft as a result of our inspections

6176720 se hizo en tiempos de monse or samuel ruiz y es una biblia ecum nica es decir hecha entre diferentes confesiones cristianas
6176721 para nosotros es muy importante que la palabra de dios nos una en vez de que sea una causa de divisi n entre cat licos y protestantes
6176722 es un ejemplo de que s se puede avanzar en la unidad a veces nos encontramos algunas confesiones cristianas muy fundamentalistas y muy contrarias a buscar la unidad y en cambio sucede al rev s con el pastor abner l pez y con la sociedad b blica de m xico
6176723 hemos encontrado un ambiente cordial y de respeto de saber valorar nuestras diferencias pero sobre todo de trabajar juntos para que la palabra de dios llegue en los idiomas de los pueblos ind genas
6176724 el hecho de que se tenga ya en tzeltal en la biblia cat lica y sta en tzotzil ecum nica es un avance muy considerable
6176725 los pueblos tienen derecho a la palabra de dios en su propia idioma y ojal que pronto les podamos cumplir

6176727 where else would you find an olympic coaching centre with no fees
6176728 i knew i could beat him so i started off a little cautiously and after accumulating the points i needed i just tried to hang in there
6176729 i knew i was in the lead and i did not want to do anything foolish
6176730 i had seen the footages and knew what to expect
6176731 its not over yet i have to win the gold
6176732 coach fernandes is a crazy man he just knows one thing in life boxing sometimes we want to avoid him in the dining hall because even there he wont spare us
6176733 every fight till now has prepared me for this bout i was new then but it was an experience above all lets not forget akhil and jitenders fights they were great and spurred me on
6176734 i knew even a weak punch would open up the cut and that would end my fight
6176735 i am speechless i was shivering to see the flag being unfurled in the hall
6176736 sometimes its good not have expectations but then i think i was able to show that even indian grapplers are no pushovers on the world stage
6176737 it was a terrible feeling to lose early but my coach and i had enough confidence in my abilities and till the end we believed that we could win
6176738 it was not easy i had to compete in four bouts but then even leonid had to play in four bouts
6176739 but once i got past them and had leonid in front i thought i had a chance
6176740 i believe the indian people and the indian government can manage quite well but if there is a request we are very happy to help
6176741 i believe the hosting of the games will greatly promote the economic development of the city and the country it will accelerate infrastructure and 8230 and internationalise the city

6176753 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6176754 by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6176755 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans
6176756 we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6176757 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6176758 in tap water its fairly pleasant but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6176759 we have to determine what kind of money were talking about crystal lake just told me it will cost them an extra million
6176760 were all dealing with this right now its a major priority
6176761 all the area legislators in lake and mchenry counties are in communication on this
6176762 to sit here in august and commit yourself to paying 145 to 165 a ton doesnt seem like much of a bargain for our towns unfortunately communities arent being given a lot of options
6176763 it could be a timing issue it could be a supply issue it could be people ordering more it could be a combination
6176764 as we understand this is a midwest problem it isnt specific to illinois
6176765 we had two extraordinarily severe winters back to back where the use of salt was extreme now we have huge demand and little supply
6176766 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6176767 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6176768 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6176769 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned
6176770 we have a historic moment that we need to grasp and we need to move forward as a unified party

6176774 the 60 million a year in public money that is being spent on the protein structure initiative is enough to fund approximately 100 200 individual investigator initiated research grants

6176780 this is one of those tracks where a win means a lot to the teams and all of the drivers because of the history and just how big the races here are
6176781 weve had some shots to win here but things havent gone our way
6176782 ive had some awesome cars at bristol and its just a matter of time until we get a complete race put together this is a very good track for this fedex team we just need the results to show it
6176783 its hard not to look at the standings and check where you stand against the cutoff but you cant let that force you to race a certain way
6176784 if it makes you take less risks in terms of fuel mileage or things of that nature that makes sense but you have to race like you know how to race no exceptions it only ends up throwing you off
6176785 weve gone through this before and its a really bad feeling
6176786 i didnt think we had a race winning car at michigan but we did what we had to do to make it better each and every stop had quick stops on pit road and were going to have a good points day and thats what we needed with the chase coming up add comment
6176787 we had a great car at michigan but obviously did not get the result we were looking for
6176788 we dropped positions in the standings and now we have to enter the next few races with a different mindset
6176789 before we were in a position where taking risks wasnt an option
6176790 we had a pretty comfortable margin on the transfer spot and we didnt want to jeopardize that

6176792 woio also reported that the congresswoman is on life support at this time
6176793 the station reported today that she was transported overnight to huron hospital in cleveland after police found her in her car last evening
6176794 that mr mccains recent public flirtation with tom ridge a former pennsylvania governor who supports abortion rights was as much to give the appearance that mr mccain had an open mind on the issue as it was an embrace of mr ridge
6176795 well its not clear yet but you might just see me there
6176796 id never been to church until i met heidi she got me to go it was a big step the walls shook a little bit as i first cruised in but jesus and i are making the connection
6176797 im trying to live a more positive holy life but it takes work
6176798 heidis there going what would jesus do what would jesus do and im like jesus gave me these great comebacks and shes like no thats the devil
6176799 you know i didnt need to go to the throat on her thats just part of this industry
6176800 theyre like its good youre here and theyre patting me on the back like thank you for being here
6176801 i think everyone in the garage can say point taken
6176802 its unfortunate that those guys went to that and tried to slide in that magnet im impressed that nascar found it and saw it
6176803 when you blatantly go after stuff they come down hard on you we were a quarter inch wide on a template that didnt exist and had a six week suspension and a bunch of other stuff go on i can imagine if it is a rule like that if it has to do with traction control tires or messing with the power like that nascar does not like that they have said it all along there are a few unwritten things that you dont touch and i think that falls into that category
6176804 its like watching someone close to you get hurt and then hurting the person that hurt them
6176805 youre still not right two wrongs dont make a right
6176806 i think from a penalty status the biggest thing that sets out in my mind is what they did they did not cheat in that race at michigan in my opinion
6176807 a hundred percent they did not cheat in that race at michigan but what they did was even worse than that they attempted to cheat in the next two seasons by doing what they did on that dynojet its worse than cheating in that one race
6176808 its almost like what they did was just worse than even cheating in that one race i almost wish they would have cheated in that one race because i would have felt better about it but what they attempted to do was cheat us for the rest of the season all the way up to probably atlanta of next year before another dyno test was done
6176809 the reality of it was that they still had a better package and the fact that we put the plate on just accentuated that along with the fact that their teams got stronger
6176810 so then youre left in a situation where you have a manufacturer which has built an engine that is just designed superior to ours and there was really nothing that nascar could do they didnt have an old motor to go back to they couldnt take away the toyota motor
6176811 i hear from the fans all the time well why dont you guys go to work well we did we did go to work to fix it but the piece thats sitting on the table makes no sense to bring out ill give nascar the credit that when they came up with the taper rule to reduce the toyotas and kind of looking at their thinking and my view of it is that i think there is a financial cold war of a sense in the series in the sport and by not allowing chevrolet to have their new engine theyre not necessarily prolonging but trying to lessen that effect
6176812 if we were given the new engine tomorrow wed be right there with the toyota
6176813 we need those guys so it was a tough decision and the decision to put the plate on to reduce the toyotas was one that i didnt even feel very good about because i hate to see that happen and i understand 100 percent what gibbs went through and why they would be disappointed and why they would do the things that they did

6176815 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
6176816 the impact on the energy market has been significant as demonstrated by the momentous jump in gas and electricity prices the amount of gas available to export from norway to countries including the uk will be cut significantly and without adequate storage the uk will be left to negotiate with russia and the far east for supplies or risk running low on energy
6176817 non proliferation experts worry about reprocessing because it allows for the separation of pure plutonium from spent fuel rods
6176818 in principle it can be used directly to make weapons
6176819 the viability of commercial nuclear power in india depends on the quality of enr technology
6176820 right now india can live with enr equipment if its nuclear programme matures in ten years it will want enr technology
6176821 a bilateral or multinational program to develop a proliferation resistant fuel cycle
6176822 it is doubtful that dae will ever trust the americans enough to share a breeder with the us
6176823 the daes declared future for breeder reactors in india is in metallic fuels
6176824 so india saw the enr issue as a cost cutting technology the us saw it as a means to rework the global nuclear hierarchy
6176825 the nsg guidelines will have to include some moralising language to keep the anti nuclear axis happy
6176826 there are going to be all these countries sitting in a room in vienna they wont care about indo us relations or climate change or indias past nuclear record
6176827 augh hes ruining the coffee with all this sweet shit

6176833 to be or not to be that is the question
6176834 not til later probably he just comes in you know

6176888 sunderland is a new challenge a team that people think small looking to grow up and that invest a lot in signings to achieve a good season
6176889 i was disappointed of my time of play in the last few games
6176890 there are very nice things to achieve this year for marseille
6176891 theres a good team and good competitions to play i must confess i have lots of regrets but the coach took his own decisions and i respect it
6176892 i dont think i am a priority for him as a consequence i think this departure is the best thing for everybody
6176893 im just annoyed because i didnt get to savour looking up and coming in third because of that its unsportsmanlike i would never pull on someones legs so i would never assume someone would do it to me
6176894 but at the end of the day ive got one of these and she hasnt so thats enough i dont want to start an inter country war
6176895 it was really crowded going around the corners there was a lot of grabbing and pulling but i have to say i was no angel either
6176896 everyone was just beating each other up i have never experienced such a race before it was horrible
6176897 were best friends we train together and we just kind of knew when to kick at the right time
6176898 its amazing what a silver medal can do for you

6177037 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6177038 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6177039 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6177040 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6177041 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6177042 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie

6177046 anybody who knows anything about our band know that the one thing that we care most about is positivity through music
6177047 so we try to write uplifting songs whether they sound that way or not thats what they are that song is just saying dont go through life with your eyes closed because its just hoping that everyone can feel human again one day and not walk down the street with a bitter look on their face and they can actually smile at people
6177048 it is a matter for the chinese authorities to decide what action they take now
6177049 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6177050 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6177051 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6177052 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6177053 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6177054 get paul gadd back now and lets keep a careful eye on him allow the police to do their job
6177055 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6177056 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work

6177061 to cultivate knowledge and devotion to the saints along with daily meditation on the word of god and a child like love for our lady
6177062 the summer months provide an opportunity for us to read about the lives of these and all the saints
6177063 their human and spiritual experiences show us that holiness is not a luxury nor a privilege for a few
6177064 it is the common destiny of all men called to be sons and daughters of god
6177065 every life of a saint is like a new flowering

6177079 when asked what his christian faith means to him his answer was a one liner it means im saved and forgiven great scholars have wrestled with the meaning of faith for centuries mccain then retold a story weve all heard a hundred times about a guard in vietnam drawing a cross in the sand
6177080 asked about his greatest moral failure he cited his first marriage which ended in divorce while saying it was his greatest moral failing he offered nothing in the way of explanation why not
6177081 throughout the evening mccain chose to recite portions of his stump speech as answers to the questions he was being asked why he has lived 71 years surely he has some thoughts on what it all means that go beyond canned answers culled from the same speech he delivers every day
6177082 he was asked if evil exists his response was to repeat for the umpteenth time that osama bin laden is a bad man and he will pursue him to the gates of hell that was it
6177083 one after another mccains answers were shallow simplistic and trite he showed the same intellectual curiosity that george bush has virtually none
6177084 where are john mccains writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time
6177085 where are his position papers setting forth his careful consideration of foreign policy the welfare state education americas moral responsibility in the world etc etc etc

6177111 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6177112 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6177113 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6177114 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6177115 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6177116 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6177117 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6177118 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6177119 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6177120 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6177121 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs

6177124 obamas campaign on monday scoffed at the mccain proposals but obama hasnt been talking boldly about the certain path to a balanced budget he promises to cut taxes for most americans and he has a full plate of spending initiatives
6177125 both obama and clinton promised to not raise taxes on those making less than 200 000 or 250 000 a year they both just emasculated their domestic programs returning the rich to their clinton era tax rates will yield at best 40 billion a year in revenue its impossible to fund a health care plan let alone anything else with that kind of money the consequences are clear if elected they will have to break their pledge and thus destroy their credibility or run a minimalist administration
6177126 obamas spending agenda exceeding 307 billion a year dwarfs that of bill clinton a decade and a half ago and he would be sure to run into the same immovable mathematical obstacle faced by the last democratic president taxing the handful of ceos and other fat cats wont be enough the big money obama wants will have to come from the many millions of middle class taxpayers
6177127 obama has rhetorically committed to a pay as you go approach by offsetting new spending and tax cuts with new taxes or spending cuts but his proposals do not come close to meeting this standard
6177128 has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of
6177129 the obama campaign responds that tax cuts once enacted are usually renewed and do not expire therefore they say obama can legitimately claim to be recouping money for other purposes by scaling back the tax cuts obama has not identified new revenue sources or spending cuts to pay for some of what he wants to do
6177130 since winning the nomination obama reportedly has been moving toward the middle of the political spectrum but on the budget he still sounds left of center with no interest in eliminating deficit spending
6177131 frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years
6177132 barack obama says john mccains plan to balance the budget doesnt add up easy for him to say its not a goal hes even trying to reach not only does obama say he wont eliminate the deficit in his first term as mccain aims to do he frankly says hes not sure hed bring it down at all in four years considering his own spending plans
6177133 i do not make a promise that we can reduce the budget deficit by 2013
6177134 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families obama told reporters this week when asked if hed match mccains pledge
6177135 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
6177136 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
6177137 are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
6177138 changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when passed through to business owners the business income from sole proprietorships farm proprietorships partnerships s corporations etc is all taxed at the owners individual income tax rates this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature and a source of innovation and risk taking in the economy moreover these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
6177139 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
6177140 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors
6177141 individual income and tax data by state and size of adjusted gross income tax year 2006
6177142 even though senator obamas plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than 50 000 his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households over a third of the total not shown in table on average seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income
6177143 a preliminary analysis of the 2008 presidential candidates tax plans
6177144 rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide
6177145 most debate over whether to extend the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains has focused on the tax benefits of these cuts to high income taxpayers what has been largely ignored is the impact these tax policies have on corporations decisions on how best to distribute their income to shareholders including senior citizens who rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide a recent tax foundation analysis illustrated that a large number of those benefiting from dividends are seniors and those on the verge of retirement see www taxfoundation org a further analysis of these seniors earning dividends reveals that lower income seniors who file tax returns depend more heavily on divide nd income than high income seniors
6177146 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes

6177193 the significance lies in showing cells do react to cellphone radiation in a non thermal way
6177194 if cell phone radiation cannot induce biological effects then there will never be any health effects
6177195 on the other hand if we can show this radiation is able to induce biological effects then we have a different story
6177196 because of findings like this that pop up from time to time a precautionary approach is justified
6177197 safety guidelines assume health effects from mobiles can only occur when significant heating of body tissue occurs
6177198 this study shows biological changes in response to low level mobile phone radiation something that could potentially have implications for health
6177199 further research is required however guidance based purely on thermal effects is clearly out of date

6177205 like hell he does every one of his movies is for sale anywhere he can talk them in to carrying them and then theres the merchandise and books that he keeps pushing as well as the 50 a month subscription fee that people pay him to listen to his lies peddle your bullshit and your loser candidate elsewhere
6177206 this is like watching a retard rumble highly entertaining and whoever wins is still a retard
6177207 no thats wrong the weekend before the attacks there was a power down on about forty floors of one of the towers for a matter of a few hours it would have taken months to plant all of the explosives required to bring down the towers and interior structures would have had to be removed so workers could get to the supporting members to plant the hundreds of tons of explosives that would have been required just how did they do all of that with no one noticing
6177208 but the official story as you call it isnt impossible dozens of independent investigations preformed by universities and engineering groups all over the world indicate that nist got it right the fact is the truthers cant prove anything they say because their theories are totally unsupported by the facts
6177209 at the time of the attacks the wtc was 95 occupied thats a fantastic number for a complex that large oh and its going to cost more than 861 million to rebuild the complex larry silverstein lost a ton of money on the deal
6177210 maybe its because hes not a conservative hes a nut
6177211 i did an assessment of herks comments since his account started and found that the only way he could possibly make as many comments as he does would be to spend eight hours a day doing it
6177212 alex jones is clearly insane and anyone who buys in to this shit is either insane as well or a moron why dont you people get together and go live on a ranch out in the middle of nowhere so sane people dont have to deal with you anymore
6177213 he rarely states what he would do and when he does its always something that he has no chance in hell of doing abolish the irs oh yeah congress is just going to roll over and let that happen eliminate the department of education thats a laugh the president is legally responsible for enforcing all laws and regulations passed by congress and hell need all of the current agencies to do that if he were to eliminate say the fda he would be publicly refusing to enforce all of the laws and regulations that congress has passed covering things like food purity and drug testing refusing to enforce the law would be an impeachable offense and he would be out of office before his first year was up and he knows this to continue to state that he would do these things when he knows he cant means that hes a bigger liar than bush
6177214 theyve even come up with disparaging names for ron paul fans paulies paulbots pauliens paulites paulers and my personal favorite paul bearers
6177215 the problem with herk is that he refuses to debate rationally
6177216 i know this guy from threads and many of his slimy mates id guess several of the names are his alter egos also scumbags and cretins all of them centcom scrapes the bottom of the humanity barrel to get anyone to work for them these days

6177262 watching what happened in the rowing there was a definite advantage in lanes one two and three
6177263 were relying on that and hopefully we can get an advantage out of it
6177264 weve seen it happen in a lot of events over the last couple of years
6177265 you dont always get the chance to dictate your lane but we did today so we went for it hopefully it will be a big gain for us
6177266 it got pretty close but everythings a risk if you want to make big gains
6177267 and we were still only at 80 per cent today and when we finished we were only doing 10 per cent
6177268 weve got a heck of a lot more to give hopefully it will be a good final

6177280 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6177281 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6177282 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6177283 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6177284 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6177285 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6177286 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6177287 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6177288 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6177289 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6177290 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6177291 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6177292 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6177293 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6177294 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6177295 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6177296 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6177297 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6177298 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6177299 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms
6177300 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6177301 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6177302 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6177303 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6177304 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6177305 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend
6177306 i would expect that from someone who is simple minded
6177307 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6177308 oh boy you actually think you got me on that one did i ever imply that she was a creationist in fact i am glad she is not because if she were a creationist then oh boy how simple it would be to dismiss her discovery get it indeed i like the fact that she is not doh the point of the post was despite the evidence scientists will simply dismiss it its not oh well we should look at our dating methods its like we have to reevaluate how fossilization occurs oh we know this is 80 million years old because of the layer huh so after knocking down your straw man how do explain her discovery
6177309 the rocks turned out to be ancient burial stones that the inca indians placed with their dead almost one third of the stones depicted specific types of dinosaurs such as triceratops and stegosaurus and various pterosaurs the type of art form represented by these stones and their location dated them to the time of the inca culture c a d 500 1500 how could these ancient indians have known the anatomy of these creatures if they never had witnessed them firsthand
6177310 interestingly several diplodocus like dinosaurs on the stones have what appear to be dermal frills something never previously reported by scientists
6177311 also the skin of many of the carved dinosaurs resembled bumpy rosettes
6177312 again we must ask how could the incas have drawn such accurate pictures of dinosaurs if they never had seen the animals or had them described by someone who had seen them
6177313 see above in other words why are you so easily dismissing them as mere mythical creatures as i keep saying believe in this stuff and you must also believe in the hydra
6177314 yeah right if its one thing that a scientist wants is the respect of his peers
6177315 there is no evidence against evolution thats not my view in the slightest i simply dont take adaptation and mutation to be evidence for it
6177316 dinosaur soft tissue sequenced similar to chicken proteins http news nationalgeographic com news 2007 04 070412 dino tissues 2 html now look at that now is it so easy to dismiss finding soft tissue in dinosaur bones if you believe that it supports your belief well no you probably believe that birds are descended from dinosaurs thus it proves true
6177317 to me it seems still that while it can prove the 2 may have been related i still simply dont believe soft tissue could survive 65 million years
6177318 on another note though i be a creationist i am not a new earther
6177319 two years ago schweitzer gazed through a microscope in her laboratory at north carolina state university and saw lifelike tissue that had no business inhabiting a fossilized dinosaur skeleton fibrous matrix stretchy like a wet scab on human skin what appeared to be supple bone cells their three dimensional shapes intact and translucent blood vessels that looked as if they could have come straight from an ostrich at the zoo
6177320 by all the rules of paleontology such traces of life should have long since drained from the bones
6177321 fossils have richer stories to tell about the lub dub of dinosaur life than we have been willing to listen to
6177322 i invite the reader to step back and contemplate the obvious
6177323 this discovery gives immensely powerful support to the proposition that dinosaur fossils are not millions of years old at all but were mostly fossilized under catastrophic conditions a few thousand years ago at most
6177324 for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future

6177503 the nationwide series has produced some of the most exciting races of the season so far there is a lot of talent in the nationwide series and it only seems to be getting stronger each race the no 9 bumper to bumper team has been competitive all season and since we are visiting my favorite race track i thought it would be fun to get behind the wheel and join in the action the cars are a little different and the drivers are a little different but there is a lot of excitement and i am looking forward to it
6177504 man it was a while ago the last time i raced in the nationwide series at bristol was in 1999 i won the spring race in the nationwide series the year before and had high hopes for that race but in the end i started 24th and finished 24th i am going all out on friday night we want to go out and record a win kasey finished second with the same car in the spring so i would love to be able to win and rub it in a little bit nothing serious of course but we like a little friendly competition among teammates

6177507 leo has a real appreciation for what we do or at least what the girls do and is really excited about being part of the judging
6177508 hes impeccably polite and a lot of fun who better than a recording star whose career has spanned four decades to judge a competition with beautiful naked women
6177509 ive had plenty of one night stands but the only person in over 20 years that ive brought home is my new girlfriend
6177510 this allows our sprint cup crew chiefs and drivers to gather more data in the nationwide series races which we think will aid our sprint cup programs
6177511 its exciting im looking forward to running for dlp and hall of fame racing its always fun to run with a team youve never run with before i like the crew chief over there steve boyer im looking forward to working with him im just ready to get racing at bristol weve had some success there so were looking forward to the weekend
6177512 its challenging and it puts you behind the eight ball a little bit sprint cup racing is challenging enough as it is let alone doing a one off with a team but it can be fun and i think well have a good weekend
6177513 i dont think there is any specific reason i just think weve always been able to do fairly well there its a long night of racing and you just need to get into a rhythm and stay out of trouble and try to make it to the end we usually are able to find a rhythm and its just a matter of staying out of trouble
6177514 we ran a dirt late model in macon ill tuesday night and won im at the craftsman truck series race on wednesday in bristol and then running a race at paducah ky on thursday night well get back rest up and be ready to go friday and saturday at bristol its just another normal week of racing

6177519 sunday night was a great race for us we learned quite a bit about our car now we just have to take the right steps to get this team rolling forward to get me rolling forward to get confidence so everybody rolls forward
6177520 its about the basics qualifying good enough to start up front in the heats and then taking advantage of the situations we have a lot of great guys here and great support from all of our sponsors backing us its just about building on each step sunday we qualified decent had a good heat race and dash and then made some progress in the feature last night we were able to build on that progress
6177521 the good thing about billings is that weve raced there before and had some success i raced from the last starting spot to eighth one night there after racing an arca car i felt like i should have won the night tsr teammate donny schatz broke while he was leading but we ended up third that night august 20 2005 my guys steve swenson mike cool and bob curtis have been doing a good job so im sure theyll have the bass pro shops chevy fast again this week as far as castrol goes im pretty sure the 20 car was fast there last year so hopefully we can continue getting better and have another good week

6177534 and is really parching dry like paper yes like drinking paper from the copy machine
6177535 we had an awesome car all day i felt like i ran the most patient race i have ever run at bristol i kept my emotions in check all day and thought from that side everything was going really well that second to last set of tires we put on made us really free and we dropped back to fifth then we came in and put tires on under caution and with that last set of tires we were tight i couldnt turn it through the center of the corner at all its hard when everybody gets their cars right at the end of the race and you become a little bit off it was hard to hold those guys back so we just tried to race smart there and bring our car home in one piece
6177536 its one of my favorites but bristol is a track thats feast or famine if you have a really good day its a lot of fun but if you have one little problem it normally makes for a very long day weve had more long days than good days
6177537 if you win races the points take care of themselves every week when we go to the track were going to try to win the race and if we cant win well finish as high as we can and get as many points as we can once we do that the points will just have to be what they are
6177538 well take it one day at a time i mean were not worried about anything because we just have to go and do our job every week were not reinventing the wheel here we just dont need to have any bad luck thats what it really boils down to were not doing anything differently you just cant afford to have a bad day you dont have to have a great day but you just cant afford to have a bad day
6177539 i dont think itll be any different i still think when it comes to racing guys are simply just racing i think at the end of the day they look at the point standings but for the most part the whole time youre out there youre worried about winning the race or doing as well as you can i really dont think peoples mindsets will change
6177540 bristol is awesome you can go from the bottom to the top and with the old surface you just couldnt do that if you got hung on the outside you were stuck and if you tried to force your way back into line thats when trouble would typically start i dont know what its like to watch but from where i sit racing at bristol is pretty fun you can run all over the race track which is whats so fun about it you can race guys arent running over each other to pass each other you can work the outside you can work the inside you can go and race people instead of the normal just bump people out of the way and go on by style we used to have you arent having to root guys out of the way we should thank everybody at bristol motor speedway for doing what they did it worked and it worked well i cant give it a better grade than a plus
6177541 you just dont have time to relax everything happens so fast at the end of the day when the race is done and your adrenaline wears off youre worn out but when youre in the car and the adrenalines pumping you dont get in that smooth calm rhythm that you do at a place like michigan or california where youve got big sweeping corners and long straightaways theres no time to relax you dont get that luxury at bristol its standard short track racing
6177542 youve got to make sure that you keep the fenders on your car all night and that youre not beating up your race car if that means a guy gets underneath you and youve got to let him go then thats what you do but at the same time you still have to race hard and not give up track position and lap times because it doesnt take long before youre in lapped traffic its a track where you need to be really aggressive but at the same time taking care of your equipment all night is key

6177627 regarding endless land disputes almost everywhere in cambodia under the rule of prime minister hun sen
6177628 this well known british newspaper went on to say that although hun sen is smart and intelligent and has political skills hun sens success was based on survival not on a vision for the future if hun sen does not change his way of ruling poor people will seek different means to achieve justice
6177629 political and economic observers in cambodia agree with the analysis of this article published on sunday 17 august 2008 in
6177630 political and economic observers in cambodia added that just some days after the fourth term elections on 27 july 2008 suddenly land disputes erupted again brutally such as in stung treng ratanakiri mondolkiri kratie kompong chhnang kandal svay rieng kampot and battambang
6177631 these officials said that the fourth term government will be again led by prime minister hun sen the vice president of the cambodian peoples party but hun sen does not have any clear policies to solve land disputes therefore land disputes will really erupt in all provinces countrywide
6177632 economic analysts said that the fourth term government again led by prime minister hun sen as vice president of the cambodian peoples party might not lead to real growth of the national economy because hun sen does not have economic skills and he can only borrow money from foreign countries and ask for funds from the international community to extend the breath of his government
6177633 economic analysts continued to say that economic growth in 2008 will be lower than in 2007 and economic growth in 2009 will decline further compared to 2008 because of corruption and bureaucracy in important state institutions where such affairs are spreading stronger without any intervention this means that the government led by the same incompetent prime minister and state institutions controlled by the same corrupt officials will not make the economy grow even foreign loans will be lost because of corruption this will make poor citizens to suffer more because the little economic growth is only for the benefit of corrupt officials and for partisans of powerful leaders

6177673 theres been since the ancient greeks a very close link between music and mathematics people think that composers sit there with their pen over the manuscript paper and god sends his inspiration down the top of the pen onto the paper well in some cases it seems perhaps they did perhaps mozart but in other cases one has to impose a discipline and the discipline of number is an excellent discipline the fibonacci sequence people have been using for centuries natures numbers the number of leaves on a fern the number of seeds on a sunflower head and how they are arranged this is the fibonacci sequence used in art and architecture and music although when you hear it in music it is not recognised even george gershwin used it in porgy and bess now who knows that

6177721 it has turned out to be busier than i thought
6177722 and a lot of my work does involve doing something about the pot holes or blocked sewers
6177723 some of these issues may seem mundane in comparison to genocide in rwanda or apartheid in south africa
6177724 but what gives me satisfaction is helping people fight city hall when they have a justified complaint and it is being ignored
6177725 there were people living in shacks with no shoes there were no social programs just soup kitchens
6177726 that along with the second world war formed an urge within me to do something about these problems
6177727 he was someone for whom i had a lot of respect but i joined the young liberals without thinking id ever be elected
6177728 i thought i would simply be a militant within the party but suddenly an opening came and i got nominated and elected

6177816 even though there were several warnings about these systems that failed nothing was ever followed up and thats the difficulty
6177817 if you dont have adequate staff you dont have adequate oversight then people can fall through the cracks and then tragedies happen
6177818 the difficulty is its not easy to get that information across agencies so if the courts need the information from probation its just not quickly and easily accessible

6177830 obviously we are taking this very seriously we are not giving mr murray any special treatment here but even in the case of someone who is not a retired trooper if the same situation had happened we would do the same thing talk to all the witnesses put everything together and make sure we know what happened so if there are charges that need to be brought the appropriate person is charged
6177831 there was only a faint smell of alcohol on his breath at the scene and there are serious questions as to how this accident happened
6177832 there are questions as to whether or not he was even intoxicated at the scene so there are issues here and we so thats why we cant rush to judgment
6177833 i think you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their mortgages what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps

6177861 what i am concerned about is whoever the individual sex offender is that we have in place the necessary provisions to monitor them
6177862 no paedophile is a celebrity every paedophile needs to be controlled
6177863 pretty hard to imagine it would be legitimate for him to travel abroad again
6177864 i think its right that we use police time to monitor sex offenders
6177865 if you are a british citizen you have the right to use the nhs whatever we think about an individual and this is a pretty despicable person
6177866 get paul gadd back now and lets keep a careful eye on him allow the police to do their job
6177867 this clearly illustrates why its so important to have binding agreements between countries which will prevent sex offenders hopping from one place to another and possibly going underground where they will pose a serious threat to children
6177868 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work
6177869 it just started to snowball and we got momentum and it took a lot of hard work lot of phone calls lot of foot work but its been worth it so far because we got it off the ground
6177870 the strength i find is the fact this is a missing part of my life and i need to find my daughter and this is our job now if you have no other job for the rest of your life your job is to find that child that is missing

6177891 the mccain campaign believes that some of hillary clintons tactics especially questioning whether obama is ready to lead can be a real winner
6177892 the mccain team has been very open that they went to school on the hillary clinton campaign that they learned from that
6177893 and on this 3 a m ad whats very striking as some have pointed out over the last few days is that barack obama was winning a steady streak of victories against hillary clinton
6177894 and then she ran that ad and she really went on the attack on the experience question and she won the bulk of the primaries thereafter in the closing months of the democratic primaries and won 500 000 more votes than he did and almost took it away from him
6177895 which candidate do voters believe is better qualified to deal with russia mccain by better than 2 1
6177896 going after more centrist voters more swing voters more conservative voters who will be a much bigger deal in the general election than they were in those primaries and caucuses
6177897 not only did the clinton campaign give mccain and his advisers a road map but they actually started the mccains down that path
6177898 thats why youre hearing from obama very specific policy oriented proposals here
6177899 theres not a lot of that kind of flash if you will from the earlier days
6177900 the big question now is whether obama can successfully regain control of the campaign agenda as we head into the democratic convention
6177901 what the clinton campaign demonstrated is when you bring obama back down to earth its a better battle

6177931 you start fighting up and coming guys and you have to fight more guys to make your way up to the top i want to fight the best of the best and thats what im doing with this upcoming fight
6177932 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
6177933 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
6177934 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
6177935 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
6177936 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
6177937 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market

6177940 i walked in the middle of the day and left it on the desk
6177941 obviously the democrat party doesnt think theres anything wrong with obtaining a key from somewhere and entering my office after hours and leaving an anonymous packet on my desk
6177942 it makes me wonder whether my sensitive constituent information in safe in my office
6177943 the point of the matter is that mr mccall is very upfront about the fact that he made a mistake years ago that hes a different person today
6177944 to the point where we would be there for four or five hour chunks trying to get all the dogs adopted it was a really great place they were doing a lot
6177945 groups of them would be gone and i thought wait a minute this doesnt seem right we kept asking where are all the dogs whats happening we were very vocal about it and they didnt appreciate that
6177946 so and so was too aggressive another not adoptable and the rest too sick
6177947 i started feeling like if im coming here im supporting what they are doing it just kind of tugged at me
6177948 but if i didnt come here i wouldnt be there for the dogs
6177949 we believe that we should be there for all animals and that we shouldnt be turning animals away based on subjective criteria
6177950 its a strange and surreal stance for an organization that boasts the word humane in its name
6177951 its really quite sleazy the way they misrepresent themselves to the public
6177952 of course it would be great to get those euthanasia numbers down but do we honestly expect that to happen overnight
6177953 that this is a regurgitation of the points attempted to be made in his book

6177976 javier was the key to getting bua accredited by the texas higher education coordinating board and by the association for biblical higher education
6177977 as much as id like for him to spend all his time on his new duties we cant afford to make that change until we are approved by sacs but some of the academic administrative duties will be assigned to others

6177989 weve been blasted with a great deal of criticism from our fans and others for allowing players of the calibre of chamangwa and fransman to leave at a time when we were trying to re establish the club as a front runner in the psl
6177990 but they had escape clauses in the contracts stipulating that if any overseas based clubs were interested in securing their services we had to let them go
6177991 obviously losing chamangwa in particular has proved a major setback

6178103 was killed because the catholic missionaries are on the side of the poor in this region in which there still exists a harsh form of servitude in the agricultural industry land owners do not recognize the rights of farm workers and make use of fanatical hindu gangs to put a stop to any improvement to the living conditions of the rural population
6178104 in this region hindu inspired fanaticism uses religion only as a pretext for carrying out these crimes

6178110 its only right that i give back to the community and e4ea is the perfect organization which offers such a great service where i can use my celebrity status to let our youth know to make smart choices and education is very important
6178111 this is the first comprehensive collaboration among these agencies and it provides an exciting opportunity to serve transition youth and adults with severe mental illness

6178114 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything but at the same time theres already been discussion among the western states

6178117 itll spark problems in colorado when someone in arizona talks about revisiting things
6178118 thats generally interpreted as meaning that arizona wants more of colorados water
6178119 would never damage the state of colorados rights over the water
6178120 in a purple state like colorado republicans cant afford those
6178121 we dont vote for water rustlers thieves in this state we tar and feather them
6178122 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep
6178123 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go
6178124 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change
6178125 it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration
6178126 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the us russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
6178127 i read shakespeare and the bible and i can shoot dice thats what i call a liberal education

6178184 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government

6178188 would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future
6178189 we asked them what security needs they had and they were quite specific and quite defined
6178190 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6178191 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6178192 not going to prevent the american people from helping you

6178194 we have to determine what kind of money were talking about crystal lake just told me it will cost them an extra million
6178195 were all dealing with this right now its a major priority
6178196 all the area legislators in lake and mchenry counties are in communication on this
6178197 to sit here in august and commit yourself to paying 145 to 165 a ton doesnt seem like much of a bargain for our towns unfortunately communities arent being given a lot of options
6178198 it could be a timing issue it could be a supply issue it could be people ordering more it could be a combination
6178199 as we understand this is a midwest problem it isnt specific to illinois
6178200 we had two extraordinarily severe winters back to back where the use of salt was extreme now we have huge demand and little supply
6178201 its real strenuous doing the same thing over and over and over it helps you but it takes a toll getting up early in the morning and going to bed late at night you just try to keep yourself healthy
6178202 the worst thing is staying in the dorms you get terrible beds terrible rooms its just uncomfortable the best thing is hanging around with your teammates
6178203 its good to be with each other 24 7 last night were all hanging out in our room everyone is playing cards talking stories about freshman year people in the nfl arent doing this theyre going home to their wife and kids were in there having fun playing dominoes just laughing thats something i enjoy
6178204 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
6178205 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that
6178206 you come to do a burglary on a bus you do the burglary you take your guns and get back on the bus and go home
6178207 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6178208 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6178209 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6178210 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6178211 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6178212 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6178213 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6178214 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6178215 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6178216 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6178217 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6178218 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota

6178247 en route to the new location hossfeld had noticed a dump truck parked beside a road leading to msr tampa while the truck was somewhat out of place the area included several vehicular maintenance shops and could have had a legitimate reason for being there what the cobra com mander did not know was that the truck was loaded with about 50 south african made 155 mm artillery shells and propane tanks the driver a suicide bomber was just waiting for the order to execute his mission an assault on cop tampa after hossfelds group departed the area the truck waited for the battalion tac recon group to pass by to the south on msr tampa after it passed the truck driver pulled up to the msr got out of the vehicle and made a final statement to a video camera carried by his superiors to film the attack then at about 1430 the driver climbed back into the vehicle crossed over msr tampa to the northbound lanes and sped toward the combat outpost
6178248 i dont want to speculate on what treasury secretary paulson might do they have not offered anything and we have not asked for anything i dont anticipate that we will do that

6178256 more striking than the head to head matchup however is the drop in obamas favorable rating
6178257 at the same time his negative rating has risen to 35 from 27
6178258 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6178259 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6178260 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6178261 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6178287 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present and your communities are facing the adverse impacts everyday

6178454 we began this journey with a real sense of community that was the theme of my presidency when i began
6178455 that community has really helped us move forward to meet great challenges and i think we have delivered on those promises we still have great challenges we have great opportunities ahead of us but together we will continue on the path to a stronger more vibrant and more vital university and our students will be the beneficiaries
6178456 we are poised to take some giant steps forward but we can only do that together
6178457 excluding these enrollments though were at a healthy campus enrollment of 10 500
6178458 this fall will mark the largest enrollment in our history by several thousand students
6178459 in 1998 we began with a theme of building strength through community and weve seen that played out in many ways
6178460 all around town there is a resurgence of pride in lamar university
6178461 and many many other major gifts from other individuals who have a real passion for our university
6178462 at the top of our list are funds for a new science building biology the renovation of other buildings such as maes the replacing of our physical plant and many other projects
6178463 in the past decade weve done much to improve our campus from grounds to facilities both for quality of life and our ability to deliver quality instruction
6178464 this program will focus on ensuring that all lamar freshmen experience classes that actively involve them in learning through discussion technology and group activity
6178465 engaging our freshmen in this process of critical thinking and learning will become a keystone piece in the progress of this university toward high quality innovative education using technology and best teaching practices for 21 st century students
6178466 continuing to develop courses and programs to meet the needs of the 21 st century learner will be a major part of the future of higher education not only at lamar but across the country we must be prepared to develop and deliver courses across the curriculum if we are to continue to serve our students

6178474 addressing the causes of suffering in our bodies and minds requires awareness and events like good medicine 2008 provide a wonderful opportunity for people to find clarity about their physical and emotional suffering learn and grow in a supportive and nurturing environment
6178475 why you don t lose weight and how you can
6178476 our intention with good medicine is not just to have people coming away feeling good after being pampered and serenaded all day it is to present people with knowledge tools resources and hands on experiences of natural medicine and how their own bodies have the power to self heal
6178477 few of us have been empowered to actively engage in making healthy decisions and lifestyle choices that create overall physical mental emotional and spiritual wellness particularly in communities that are most affected by chronic but preventable diseases

6178488 fiquei muito feliz com tudo fui tratada feito uma rainha e me senti honrada em ter feito as fotos no meu estado e poder assim representar a minha gente
6178489 o primeiro a paz no c ucaso e na europa
6178490 estamos escutando tantas coisas nos ltimos dias que vamos lembrar como os meios de comunica o se transformam em m todos de propaganda
6178491 esfriar as rela es n o quer dizer que v o ser paralisadas
6178492 n s n o escondemos nada apresentamos esta informa o e podemos prov la
6178493 sempre sonhei em cursar uma institui o superior assim que conclu o ensino m dio soube da vinda de um campus da ufc aqui para o cariri decidi vir logo se n o fosse assim eu teria de ir para fortaleza e seria tudo mais dif cil
6178494 o campus do cariri facilitou meus planos provavelmente eu n o teria condi es de ir para a capital entrar na universidade federal e fazer o curso que eu queria
6178495 o esfor o vale a pena agora est at mais f cil porque posso continuar morando na minha cidade sem o campus do cariri eu teria de me mudar
6178496 na minha rea por exemplo a regi o tem empresas de fruticultura floricultura e pecu ria leiteira em plena expans o os alunos de hoje futuros profissionais contribuir o ainda mais para esse desenvolvimento
6178497 a universidade tem um potencial de mudan a o desenvolvimento socioecon mico da regi o um dos objetivos da implanta o do campus aqui no cariri mas o principal a felicidade das pessoas em aperfei oar seu conhecimento
6178498 any agency or any city that hosts an event of this size is placed in a position of trying to balance first amendment and free expression with safety and security
6178499 their median age is about 20 years younger than our median age
6178500 so i dont think we can party as hard as they are now but 20 years ago we could
6178501 its a different field if you will but its no less important
6178502 its a privilege to represent this state particularly we have a great tradition here ted kennedy and going back to john quincy adams
6178503 twelve billion dollars a month a month are being spent in place where there was no al qaida and there were no weapons of mass destruction and the place where there is al qaida and there are weapons of mass destruction pakistan and afghanistan they have ignored sufficiently that its now at great risk
6178504 the fact is john mccain still doesnt think it was a mistake to go to iraq barack obama knows that it was thats judgment
6178505 im smart enough to know that in this new way that congress works you very rarely get the slot where you can bring a bill that has your own name on it to the floor
6178506 usually youre trying to attach something to something else to get it passed
6178507 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6178508 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6178509 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6178510 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6178511 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6178512 we do have quite a bit of intelligence information on anarchist groups on protesters who are intent on coming here to disrupt the convention with other than legal means
6178513 this is continued evidence that the initiatives and programs to protect workers safety and health designed by and implemented in this administration are indeed working
6178514 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6178515 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6178516 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6178517 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6178518 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6178519 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6178520 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6178521 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6178522 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6178523 today could be the day and you need to be ready
6178524 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6178525 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable
6178526 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded
6178527 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone that is going to make us want to stay home
6178528 the question is whether faa did what its supposed to do in certifying this jet
6178529 without a doubt this special review will uncover what we already know that the eclipse 500 marks the safest new airplane introduction into service in 20 years
6178530 customer safety has always been a priority at eclipse and we look forward to this investigation dispelling any inaccuracies about the certification of this airplane for once and for all
6178531 some of them may have said you know what i dont need to be a part of the army any more because they dont want me or they dont know how to treat me
6178532 well weve learned a lot and i think weve improved a lot and this is a way to reconnect with them
6178533 i think its wonderful that theyre going to reach out and offer assistance to families that may need it but i really never expected anything from the army so getting this letter was a surprise
6178534 please be candid in your conversations with our staff as your comments and concerns are important to us
6178535 we understand the sacrifices you and your family have made in service to this nation and we want to assure you the army is here to provide you the support you need for as long as you desire
6178536 it is important for the service to have the opportunity to point out on the ground exactly what our security requirements are while the event is under way
6178537 people will basically give their first young to get really good access
6178538 the contest is to get as many votes as we can to not support the two major candidates
6178539 the day before i left home for christmas i started walking my precinct
6178540 it was icy i fell down three times i had bruises all over my legs but i kept going because i believe in his message
6178541 i believe in what he has to offer america as a young person i wasnt just going to sit back and watch it all go by
6178542 but if he puts huckabee on the ticket he gets my money and he gets my physical labor
6178543 if youre willing to laugh at a candidate onstage thats a really deep personal affront
6178544 thats what really made me say im going to open up my wallet and im going to give to this guy because no one laughs at money
6178545 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6178546 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations
6178547 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6178548 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6178549 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics

6178552 we went into the match against italy relaxed about winning or losing thats why we lose
6178553 we were not on the level we should be for the beginning of the game
6178554 we are going for fifth place now and wishing montenegro all the best in the semifinals
6178555 what were concerned about is the chance that someone might half consciously check the independent box and then vote the straight democratic party ballot and then have their votes voided
6178556 in america most people believe they are independent with a small i
6178557 that is going to confuse some people and cause a lot of votes to be lost
6178558 our fundraising has been slow which kind of goes hand in hand for this time of year
6178559 im not surprised if were where we are by the end of september then i will be concerned
6178560 the question is reaching as many people as we can
6178561 its the legislators who will be deciding who the delegates are
6178562 they will be the ones who decide what questions get raised in the convention and if anything happens at all
6178563 the state constitution works and theres already a procedure in place to amend it without holding a taxpayer funded convention
6178564 obamas support among voters between the ages of 18 and 29 which had been one of his strengths slipped 12 percentage points to 52 percent mccain who will turn 72 next week was winning 40 percent of younger voters
6178565 im so sick of reading headlines like obama slams mccain or vice versa
6178566 i thought that this campaign would actually be different but its not its depressing
6178567 in any act the primary intention of him who acts is to reveal his own image

6178593 only one in five councils are using charging to the full potential not just to cover costs but to shape their area
6178594 reducing congestion improving levels of health and exercise encouraging the use of local shops
6178595 the last thing taxpayers need is even more stealth taxes and charges
6178596 its outrageous that government ministers are going round in public claiming to understand the financial pressures people are under but behind closed doors they are urging councils to squeeze everyone for even more money
6178597 councils already raise far too much by charging for things that used to be included in return for council tax
6178598 it is shocking that whitehall is pressing councils to use parking charges as a cash cow to raid the pockets of public you would have thought the excessive rises over the past decade in council tax would be enough
6178599 ministers are calling on councils to use to squeeze more money out of the public who are already struggling with the spiralling cost of living

6178619 to a reporters question about jews who have fled the fighting and come to israel he said
6178620 i wasnt expecting it to hurt so much they tell you that death is quick painless mine was quick one second i was alive the next it was all over but it hurt like a son of a bitch giles
6178621 theyre being difficult about giving you authority over the accounts
6178622 bankers are always like that i knew a whole group of venetian bankers in the sixteenth century who had instructions to only allow this one guy access to his vault after theyd examined his mole
6178623 i was beginning to worry at the end because you didnt say anything when i had post break up sex with xander you hardly looked at me after we had to make that ridiculous unnecessary journey to prove you werent the first
6178624 that was quite your fault you could have told them that youd touched me
6178625 that you trusted that i could be sure to keep our affairs private so i did
6178626 you could have mentioned that youd touched me without mentioning the affair
6178627 i couldnt think of anything to say that wouldnt let the cat out of the bag
6178628 i touched rupert right before he kissed me and i pulled off his shirt and we made passionate love on the couch when buffy was out training the cannon fodder things like that and you wouldnt have approved
6178629 i suppose i wouldnt have but it doesnt matter now
6178630 it doesnt xander will be all right eventually i think that he and andrew are good for each other and i always knew xander was interested in men ever since he spent that whole night describing what he wanted to do to angelus it was all violence and petty mischief but i still knew you just dont think that much about another man unless you also want to have sex with him
6178631 but not in a sexual way after all andrews gay so he wouldnt be interested in having sex with a woman i cant even imagine him with a girl can you
6178632 i could read the map of the world from you
6178633 harder do it harder i like it god not so many words now
6178634 youre so wet baby i know you like it a lot
6178635 or just embarrassed because the kind of girl who talks dirty is not the kind of girl i imagine myself to be i mean does it turn you on to hear me moan oh baby oh baby finger my clit like that cuz im gonna come hard
6178636 but youre all hot and flushed with my hands on you would you like it more if your hand was touching your breast right now or if my other hand was on your thigh like these are questions that are mostly yknow academic but they kind of do the turning on thing hey your smart talk turns me on because its you
6178637 after i want to taste and then i dunno i want to lick down your whole body until its as wet as i want your pussy to be when i lick it
6178638 i didnt ever think id have a movie career i always thought id be a theatre actress and so just the idea now that ive gotten to play so many different roles im really having a blast doing that
6178639 my general broad thing that i look for when im choosing a role is i like to be the exact opposite of what was the last thing i played i like things that frighten me i like doing things i dont believe i can do and sometimes i cant do them and they dont turn out well and sometimes they do connect and thats always good thats always such a relief

6178643 dibuat sebagus apa pun kolamnya sebaik apa pun kualitas airnya dan sebanyak apa pun pemberian pakannya tetap saja kepadatan udang hanya 10 ekor per meter persegi
6178644 mereka tidak pernah memperhatikan kalau udang udang yang bertengger di dekat permukaan air itu justru merasa nyaman karena bisa melakukan prosesi ganti kulit molting tanpa perlu merasa terancam
6178645 kalau nyaman udang bisa ganti kulit terus dan cepat besar
6178646 selain itu arus dalam kolam juga terhambat dan kandungan oksigen terlarutnya turun sehingga udang mudah mati

6178654 the statehood green party not the democratic or republican parties stands with the people of washington dc in our demand for the real citizenship democratic self government and full representation in congress that all other americans enjoy
6178655 were dismayed that democrats dcs largest political party have abandoned the goal of statehood
6178656 we dispute ms nortons assertion that dc is not ready for statehood and were unhappy that ms nortons submission to the democratic platform draft omits mention of statehood were as ready for statehood as everyone else in the us who already lives in a state
6178657 unlike the 2004 democratic platform the 2008 draft doesnt even endorse democratic self government the draft says we deserve the benefits of full citizenship especially the vote that are accorded to citizens of every state without explaining what these things mean or how theyre to be achieved its like saying every child deserves to be educated but refusing to endorse public schools especially the vote is even more ambiguous we already have the right to vote for president for our local elected officials and for our nonvoting delegate to the house but were still being under the boot of congress

6178666 no one really mentioned that all of these positions are being eliminated but dickey added two executive positions to his staff how come no one brings this up so we are cutting the crap out of our expense budgets eliminating people no travel etc but he adds two very expensive executive positions
6178667 we chose pure talent as they are leaders in the adult club industry and with marys ever changing evolving mainstream career we want to make sure she is working with the best
6178668 i am really excited to be working with pure talent

6178678 its really like a mini tryout because youre being seen for the first time and theyre seeing how quickly you picked up the dance
6178679 theyre all making mental notes even if nothing is said
6178680 im constantly making notes and putting a name with a face so when i go back to my desk tomorrow and go through the girls ill remember who i liked who needs to work on specific things and who has the whole package already
6178681 im coming in with the same mindset i had last year because i wasnt on the team yet and i wanted to do my best and set my standards really high
6178682 i cant sit back and think its going to be any easier this year than it was last year
6178683 the vikings have more girls try out but the ratio that make it is about the same because the vikings take 35 girls
6178684 but im really enjoying this so far and the routine is great
6178685 i wasnt really getting anywhere in adelaide australia with my dancing because my city was kind of small so i thought id come to america
6178686 weve had a chance to see what dance teams are like in 13 different markets around the nba which gives us a better perspective to give second opinions as the process continues
6178687 i want someone who catches my eye thats a great dancer who also embodies the look of the timberwolves brand
6178688 first of all i listen to the song probably 45 times on my computer and it just comes into my head what i envision happening where
6178689 i choreograph literally in my room which is not big at all into a mirror from there i take it to a studio where there is more room and mirrors and i can try it full out to see if it works
6178690 i like strong sharp movements and a little bit of sass
6178691 if were going to do a back roll for example id put you up against a wall let your head touch let your shoulders touch and butt touch and thats the roll
6178692 some people roll easier than others but thats basically it
6178693 everyone learns at a different pace so i try and keep an eye on them to see how theyre doing if you see looks of fear its time to slow down and keep doing it until i feel like enough people have it
6178694 the dancing is pretty similar to what im used to in the australian league so it was great for me
6178695 you d have to say to yourself this is in fact world war iii
6178696 i might consider it i don t think it s necessary but i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally could serve

6178699 now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
6178700 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to mccain last month three quarters of which came after his june 16 speech calling for an end to the ban
6178701 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now
6178702 dont walk in front of me i may not follow dont walk behind me i may not lead just walk beside me and be my friend
6178703 i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us i will let no one question my love for this country
6178704 fail faster to succeed sooner its a mantra of ours here at t9 failing is when theory turns to practice failing is where the learning comes in failing is what leads to success but no matter how often we say it its still hard to live it so this fall try a little failing with us here at t9 the opportunities are endless

6178706 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6178707 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6178708 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6178709 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6178710 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6178711 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6178712 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6178713 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6178714 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6178715 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

6178717 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6178718 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6178719 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6178720 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6178721 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6178722 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6178723 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6178724 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6178725 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6178726 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6178727 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6178728 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6178729 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

6178756 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6178757 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6178758 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6178759 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6178760 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6178761 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
6178762 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
6178763 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
6178764 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
6178765 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
6178766 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
6178767 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
6178768 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
6178769 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
6178770 much worse than we would have imagined as recently as six months ago
6178771 the creeping nationalization of energy assets and the fact that much of the low hanging fruit has been picked
6178772 the deteriorating investment climate in the russian energy sector has clearly deterred foreign investment and it goes without saying that fighting wars with neighbors is not going to make the kremlin look warm and fuzzy
6178773 the russians are highly dependent on old oil fields with rising water cuts
6178774 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
6178775 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
6178776 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6178777 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6178778 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6178779 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6178780 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6178781 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6178782 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6178783 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6178784 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6178785 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6178786 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6178787 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6178788 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6178789 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6178790 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6178791 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6178792 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6178793 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6178794 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6178795 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6178796 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6178797 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6178798 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6178799 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6178800 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6178801 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6178802 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6178803 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6178804 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6178805 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6178806 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6178807 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6178808 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6178809 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6178810 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6178811 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6178812 one two three hold four five six seven hold eight
6178813 one two three five six seven one two three five six seven
6178814 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6178815 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6178816 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6178817 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6178818 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6178819 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6178820 run by a gun zealot whos too blinded by the nra
6178821 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6178822 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6178823 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6178824 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6178825 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6178826 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6178827 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6178828 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6178829 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6178830 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6178831 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6178832 dna evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented
6178833 gt harry knopp you can track this story using the links to the groups webs
6178834 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6178835 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6178836 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6178837 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6178838 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6178839 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6178840 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6178841 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6178842 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6178843 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6178844 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6178845 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6178846 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6178847 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6178848 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6178849 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6178850 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6178851 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6178852 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6178853 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6178854 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6178855 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6178856 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6178857 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6178858 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6178859 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6178860 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6178861 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6178862 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6178863 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6178864 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6178865 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6178866 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6178867 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6178868 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6178869 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6178870 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6178871 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6178872 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6178873 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6178874 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6178875 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6178876 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6178877 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6178878 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6178879 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6178880 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6178881 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6178882 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6178883 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6178884 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6178885 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6178886 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6178887 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6178888 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6178889 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6178890 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6178891 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6178892 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6178893 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6178894 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6178895 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6178896 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6178897 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6178898 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6178899 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6178900 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6178901 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6178902 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6178903 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6178904 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6178905 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6178906 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6178907 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6178908 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6178909 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6178910 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6178911 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6178912 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6178913 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6178914 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6178915 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6178916 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6178917 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6178918 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6178919 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6178920 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6178921 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6178922 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6178923 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6178924 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6178925 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6178926 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6178927 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6178928 this is a planning took where all things are going
6178929 fue el principal perpetrador de cr menes y violaciones de los derechos humanos tomando como medida de ello la cantidad de personas muertas y desaparecidas
6178930 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6178931 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6178932 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6178933 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6178934 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6178935 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6178936 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6178937 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6178938 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6178939 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6178940 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6178941 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6178942 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6178943 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6178944 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6178945 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6178946 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6178947 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6178948 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
6178949 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
6178950 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

6178953 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6178954 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6178955 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

6179036 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6179037 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6179038 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6179039 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6179040 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6179041 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6179042 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer

6179044 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6179045 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6179046 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6179047 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6179048 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6179049 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6179050 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6179051 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6179052 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6179053 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6179064 this contract is a crown jewel in our renewable energy portfolio the project is attractive to sce because of its size near term delivery and its competitive price
6179065 much worse than we would have imagined as recently as six months ago
6179066 the creeping nationalization of energy assets and the fact that much of the low hanging fruit has been picked
6179067 the deteriorating investment climate in the russian energy sector has clearly deterred foreign investment and it goes without saying that fighting wars with neighbors is not going to make the kremlin look warm and fuzzy
6179068 the russians are highly dependent on old oil fields with rising water cuts
6179069 this should be a grand time for ethanol with sales climbing and high gasoline prices making every alternative fuel more attractive but the ethanol push is looking like a noble idea gone bad
6179070 every day government takes actions aimed at helping industries some pan out some dont its how the government reacts and makes adjustments thats what matters most
6179071 it not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill any government policy that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of americans is bad public policy
6179072 this should be a grand time for ethanol with sales climbing and high gasoline prices making every alternative fuel more attractive but the ethanol push is looking like a noble idea gone bad
6179073 the trick lies in striking a fair balance encouraging new development and innovation without biasing the system toward one player
6179074 when the government steps in and says were going to replace gasoline with x or y it cuts out all those smart people and instead replaces them with a lobby thats only purpose is to keep the subsidies flowing
6179075 we bought fertilizer and corn seed decided our crop mix on the basis of ethanol being where it was to change that mandate in the middle of our growing season thats really not right
6179076 when we gave gvg they would steadily lose weight and when we took them off gvg they would steadily gain weight

6179078 for substance abusers the number one cause of relapse is environmental cues triggers
6179079 a fairly significant proportion of subjects who are obese suffer from something called they binge eat based on cues they see a cake they smell a hamburger and they crave and they start to eat one of the great things about this drug is it stops this

6179099 the underlying story in this retail sales report is consistent with that
6179100 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6179101 to develop a proposal we can debate with brazilian society
6179102 these reserves put brazil in a privileged situation with enormous possibility to spark a new cycle of growth that could last 10 15 or more years so we can recover the decades when brazil was stagnated and only generating unemployment
6179103 a new state owned company would betray the investors in petrobras there are thousands of brazilians who put their money into the company who wont see their investment grow if they are kept from these reserves
6179104 actually further disrupt and complicate our efforts to serve our customers the vast majority of proposals in the bill are things we already do

6179120 you meet him and youd never believe hes one of the best fighters in the world
6179121 hes used to being on the big stage competing i dont think this will affect him
6179122 i was always the shortest kid and when i turned 10 or 11 i learned to use size to my advantage
6179123 a lot of kids would see me and try to aim for my head and id go under their leg and do a spin kick and hit them they werent expecting it
6179124 he has to work that much harder to be better than a lot of other people
6179125 hes been told so often that he cant do something because hes so short he likes to prove everyone wrong
6179126 i wouldnt be surprised if he wins the gold i dont think too many people in the world can beat him he gets in there and turns it on he has one of the biggest hearts for a competitor

6179141 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6179142 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6179143 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6179144 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away
6179145 thats going to have some serious consequence at the retail level
6179146 the only thing left is for prices to go up
6179147 from a consumer standpoint more and more of these feed costs are going to be passed on and that means higher prices at the supermarket

6179152 the referees have an important role to play and although people say the best referees are the ones that arent seen i think those days are gone because of the media coverage
6179153 from that point of view all we ask is that the referees get the big decisions right
6179154 we have a good crew who they are an honest bunch but they make mistakes
6179155 however there has to be an understanding that they will make mistakes and that the mistakes have got to be accepted
6179156 they asked if referees are accountable and we explained how they are accountable
6179157 there is an observer system and we analyse their marks at the end of the season and that decides where they will be placed the following season
6179158 but we are not going to hang any referee out to dry thats not what we are designed for
6179159 lets not forget weve had the first two weeks of the season and we have looked at some magnificent games of football
6179160 the dundee united versus celtic game was a super game as was hamilton against dundee united and hearts versus motherwell
6179161 but we have centred on two decisions and we have to centre on the positives rather than the negatives
6179162 i felt it was a big plus and it helped to clear the air
6179163 it got a bit heated at times but i think thats a good thing
6179164 the whole idea is to build up a better understanding of the difficulties we face
6179165 i think the idea is great and there should be one at the beginning of the season and one in the middle in case other hiccups or problems arise
6179166 i didnt quite understand where he was coming from but thats all right i appreciated the call

6179171 this we thought was an answer to a mystery thats been going on for far too long
6179172 as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6179173 lets ask ourselves why is congress not securing our borders could it be they have greater global goals that will ultimately dissolve this whether intentionally or not government has failed for decades to secure the borders it is up to us to make sure it gets done and if we dont do our part as we know it will dissolve like a sugar cube in coffee from the coast land to the heartland we will lose our distinctions and no longer even recognize our country

6179177 intended to rubber stamp a russian interpretation of the plan that we do not agree with
6179178 calls upon the parties concerned to implement the above mentioned plan in good faith
6179179 no one can object to the security council endorsing the six principles of the russian and french presidents which form the foundation of all current efforts to normalize the situation
6179180 to put the spotlight on the fact that the russians have not withdrawn
6179181 we will assess the situation on the ground and whether there are concrete and credible signs of withdrawal in the days ahead we will see based on this
6179182 when it comes to decadal predictions that explain anything more than a tiny fraction of the variability in anything more than a tiny fraction of the land area i have yet to be shown any result that says that this is possible even theoretically
6179183 so if thats what it takes to be more useful then no way
6179184 me and director paul w s anderson were just riding over here in my truck watching some clips and i was just saying that this film has the formula
6179185 while we were filming it man it just felt like it
6179186 and then you know of course they used to shoot the whole movie then go do all the editing afterwards and now the new formula of course is to do all the special effects and do all the editing while youre still filming so while were on the set still filming theyre sending anderson dvds and hes showing us all these edits of all these action sequences that theyre doing now and it was just like yo it just gets everybody more fired up to keep going
6179187 i hope none of you leak the surprise at the end
6179188 but i felt like the sequel has been set up nicely and for me just in general i like doing one offs films that feel like theres only going to be one but im more excited about franchises you know what i mean i love the idea that were doing something so special that the audience would want to go see another one and another one
6179189 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes

6179231 the intent was to allow every two three or four on our team to play to show exactly where they stand and i was disappointed would be the overall reaction
6179232 i feel like we have a really good team and i feel like it is the farthest any team have been at this point since ive been the coach
6179233 our execution is solid right now my hope was that after today i would feel better about our depth but thats now how i feel but the players in front of them i feel very good about
6179234 not only offensively and defensively there were drop offs from our ones special teams then took a drop off even more than that with a few key players so poor in fundamentals and assignments that we couldnt function

6179243 i want to encourage people in this community who may not normally think that they have the time to run for council to reconsider
6179244 i think its important that we have people from all walks of life and that includes people who have businesses who are busy and think they are too busy for council we have people sitting at this table who have jobs who run multiple businesses and still have time to make a contribution to their community
6179245 my greatest concern is we have a good representation of our community and not just people who are looking for jobs if you need a job and you cant find one then this isnt what you should be doing
6179246 anybody running for council has to understand that youre an independent person and you stand up and make all kinds of promises and criticisms of the current council and how much better you would do let me tell you its not as easy as you think it is
6179247 ive listened especially in the last week to a lot of innuendo about this council a lot of mean spirited nasty things have been said in the last week and it bothers me because there isnt one person sitting around this council table that is mean spirited that doesnt care deeply about this community and doesnt think long and hard about the decision that get made

6179254 this document is a trust for the benefit of the citizens that this land is to be held not sold in perpetuity for the benefit of citizens and is to be used for municipal purposes so why would the citizens elected officials go to court to have that struck down its just bizarre i dont understand the decision making process at city hall that would do that when i believe the vast majority of citizens simply would like it to be left alone yet the elected officials will not leave it alone

6179478 a year ago when it was being talked about there were mixed thoughts running through my mind
6179479 i thought of jarrod cunningham a good mate of mine who i played with in new zealand and whose opinion i respected i knew what he went through
6179480 he was asked to play for england as well but turned it down and said he would never wear the rose
6179481 i thought about it knowing i didnt get the opportunity to play for new zealand at the highest level
6179482 to get the chance to play at the highest level and test myself against the best players in the world is fantastic

6179484 one opinion in particular that i respect is norm hewitts he sent a lovely e mail wishing me all the best and giving his blessing
6179485 he was a person i looked up to as a leader and a player when i first saw the e mail from him i thought oh heck he might say something about wearing the england jersey
6179486 but he told me to go and grab it with both hands and to do my best to get comments like that was a real boost
6179487 not once have i thought shucks what have i done im a kiwi i have no regrets whatsoever
6179488 im proud to wear my england training kit and hopefully ill get to pull on the jersey as well

6179563 the bank has an even higher burden around fraud detection
6179564 it would be incorrect to say that there is no potential for fraud our responsibility and i think we meet that is to be sure that we stay abreast of the security protocols and the security activities that will make the transactions as secure as absolutely possible
6179565 the fact is society is changing and now financial institutions want to make that change
6179566 i think it would be a foolish mistake to bypass this opportunity
6179567 checks at the corporate level are going to be around for years and years and years
6179568 helping build a community of entrepreneurs by giving them the tools support and solutions they require in order to build successful companies is extremely important for building sustainable communities
6179569 on the african continent there are more versions of business centers than there are countries for example angola has at least two one is a library of relevant training and reference materials backed by a staff of counselors to accommodate walk in clients and another restricts itself to industries related to oil production and export in order to help build a specific economic sector

6179573 at the moment there is a favorable climate for entrepreneurship but even those with good ideas dont have access to capital
6179574 convene a meeting of business groups and have a clear conversation about your vision and dream then ask them how they can be part of this center which would be breaking new ground
6179575 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything but at the same time theres already been discussion among the western states

6179583 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep
6179584 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go
6179585 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change

6179654 overall i would be against this diet as there is a general lack of science around it
6179655 specifically this plan involves cutting out all types of foods for no logical explanation people with blood group a are not even allowed bananas usually the dieters favourite food so it could well mean youll end up with an unbalanced diet and a low intake of certain nutrients

6179788 23 and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority 24 and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things 25 the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him 26 but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet 27 and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
6179789 24 and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things 25 the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him
6179790 25 the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him 26 but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet 27 and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things
6179791 25 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess
6179792 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth
6179793 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now 13 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come
6179794 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
6179795 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord
6179796 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints
6179797 13 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat 14 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it
6179798 if it was good enough for mom and dad it is good enough for me
6179799 37 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me
6179800 13 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ 14 and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light 15 therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works
6179801 12 then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying 13 but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up 14 let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
6179802 11 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so
6179803 there is a way which seems right to a man but its end is 12 there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
6179804 he who trusts in his own heart is a fool
6179805 26 he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered
6179806 23 o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps
6179807 24 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith
6179808 25 but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster
6179809 4 wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god
6179810 6 but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter
6179811 6 and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter
6179812 22 then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren 23 and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia 24 forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment 25 it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul 26 men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ 27 we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth 28 for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things 29 that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
6179813 11 now all these things happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come
6179814 14 let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch
6179815 false teachers who will secretly bring in destructive 1 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction
6179816 42 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers
6179817 11 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so

6179864 a meandering first half gives way to a spectacular psychological portrait of the deafening silence of pain and loneliness in austrian writer director g tz spielmanns revanche
6179865 revanche starts out in ulrich seidl territory among a group of russian and ukrainian prostitutes held prisoner in a viennese brothel but soon shifts gear becoming something else entirely first a doomed love story then a drama of revenge and redemption one whose stifling provincialism and inexorable sense of fate recalled nothing so much as fassbinders the merchant of four seasons

6179930 maar als wij bepalen dat de wolf op een dieet van ondoden leeft dan zal het zo zijn

6179935 daarom wil ik vragen aan marleen of ze een visioen wil oproepen om te zien of elorion nog leeft en waar hij is wat hij doet
6179936 ik weet niet goed of ik nou moet hopen of hij nog leeft of dat hij dood is
6179937 maar ik hoop toch maar dat hij nog leeft misschien heeft hij wel een vrouw
6179938 zelfs als hij nog leeft weet ik nog niet wat ik dan zal doen hij heeft me nooit zien staan en de kans is groot dat hij dat nog steeds niet doet misschien wil ik alleen maar aan mezelf bewijzen dat mijn moeite niet voor niets is geweest al vraag ik me af of het genoeg is als hij me nu ineens wel ziet staan het spijt me kronin meer kan ik je momenteel niet geven
6179939 ik denk het niet het gaat niet om wat je bent maar om wie je bent al zou het wel makkelijker zijn het zou het gevoel wegnemen dat me zegt dit hoort niet dit kan helemaal niet
