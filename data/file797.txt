7970004 the boy bands have won and all the copyists and the tribute bands and the tv talent show producers have won if we allow our culture to be shaped by mimicry whether from lack of ideas or from exaggerated respect you should never try to freeze culture what you can do is recycle that culture take your older brothers hand me down jacket and re style it re fashion it to the point where it becomes your own but dont just regurgitate creative history or hold art and music and literature as fixed untouchable and kept under glass the people who try to guard any particular form of music are like the copyists and manufactured bands doing it the worst disservice because the only thing that you can do to music that will damage it is not change it not make it your own because then it dies then its over then its done and the boy bands have won
7970005 most developers struggle with the nuances of making a database dance well to their directions
7970006 indeed a sql maestro is required to perform interesting queries for data transformations during etl processing or extract load transform processing or data mining during analytics
7970007 trivially parallelizable framework so that even novice developers a k a interns could write programs in a variety of languages java c c perl python to analyze data independent of scale
7970008 on its own mapreduce can do a lot of important work in data manipulation and analysis integrating it with sql should just increase its applicability and power
7970009 mapreduce isnt needed for tabular data management thats been efficiently parallelized in other ways
7970010 but if you want to build non tabular structures such as text indexes or graphs mapreduce turns out to be a big help

7970026 a m siempre me dio la impresi n de que carvalho era un juguete manejado por bisogno lo que me extra es que cada vez que el general hac a escala en roma siempre se encontraban en el aeropuerto carvalho y bisogno
7970027 no s lo le alent sino que prometi su asistencia diciendo adem s al general que los amigos portugueses ya estaban en camino lo que le constaba que no era cierto lo que hace suponer que estaba en connivencia con enemigos del general a los que facilit datos y noticias para que los llevasen enga ados a la cita fatal
7970028 me marcho a lisboa para matar dos p jaros de un tiro ver jugar al ben fica el 23 y tambi n intentar poner en marcha mi vieja idea de los interclubs de turismo
7970029 est n comprobados no s lo por declaraciones sino por el expediente porque como estos pides se cre an eternos e inmutables no destru an sus archivos
7970030 los archivos de la pide donde ten an la operaci n perfectamente rese ada con pelos y se ales y adem s la confesi n de los propios detenidos incluso silva paes el director de la pide que est detenido en caixa y que est encausado en este proceso por los portugueses ya que el juez espa ol no pod a encausarlo entonces pues era director general de la pide ha confesado que hab an preparado la operaci n pero l siempre dice de rapto y no de asesinato
7970031 y declararon la primera vez en mayo seg n iban siendo detenidos ernesto lopes ramos que es ernesto castro da sousa fue detenido en angola sobre el mes de junio o julio cuando pensaba venir a portugal como en angola era conocido como un fascista distinguido que hab a ido all despu s del asesinato de humberto delgado creyendo que no le iban a dejar salir con el nombre de lopes ramos y que lo otro estaba olvidado y no hab a rastro de ello utiliz el pasaporte de ernesto castro de sousa como ya el 25 de abril se ten a en todas las fronteras la orden dada se le detuvo al pasar con el nombre de ernesto castro de sousa no hubo que buscarlo
7970032 la muerte de arajaryr campos puede ser una laguna relativamente porque tienza agente de la pide confes en el sumario que la hab a estrangulado l que le hab a descoyuntado las v rtebras y que despu s le hab an querido pegar un tiro
7970033 no se ha confesado ninguno porque todos coinciden que dispar casimiro monteiro tambi n coinciden que ellos vinieron con el comando que entraron en villanueva del fresno casimiro monteiro parece que est en brasil como agente de la cia el juez crespo m rquez encaus a casimiro monteiro con su nombre supuesto pero no se person ste
7970034 el sumario que est haciendo portugal es una honra para la justicia espa ola y para el juez crespo que ha quedado a la altura de los mejores del mundo porque con unos mimbres muy fr giles gracias a las pesquisas de la bic y al comisario don antonio viqueira fueron atando hechos que pod an parecer fant sticos al principio pero que ahora como se desprende de las declaraciones de los pides el encauzamiento del juez crespo coincide con los hechos que ahora se est n poniendo de relieve en portugal

7970068 em uma recente partida amistosa gritei toca pai para que me passasse a bola todos os meus companheiros e rivais riram
7970069 sei que entramos na hist ria por jogarmos juntos mas tomara tamb m que possamos colaborar para um grande ano da equipe
7970070 o anorthosis uma boa equipe mas o olympiacos tem um grupo muito mais qualificado n o ser f cil mas estou confiante que podemos nos classificar
7970071 o torcedor do olympiacos totalmente apaixonado pelo clube e vai comparecer em peso amanh a press o vai ser forte em cima do anorthosis durante os 90 minutos
7970072 na liga dos campe es o gol fora de casa tem um peso maior por isso se eles fizerem um aqui s vamos nos classificar marcando cinco
7970073 eu n o sei o que est acontecendo acho que estou um pouco ansioso para fazer logo esse gol mas estou trabalhando forte e me dedicando nos treinamentos sei que acabei desperdi ando algumas chances nos ltimos jogos mas se deus quiser espero marcar contra o vila nova e ajudar meus companheiros a conquistar mais uma vit ria

7970081 lamento que no me gusten los hombres como a ti
7970082 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7970083 while it may be good politics for national to save most of its policy announcements until closer to the election its not a good look on the hustings right now for him to have to keep saying more on that later
7970084 in a facility like this the possibility for injury is enormous
7970085 its pretty standard to lose an eye lose a limb lose a life were going to have a government that makes sure workers arent put at unnecessary risk
7970086 she was good i could not have been more proud of her and she also looked cute which didnt hurt
7970087 it was kids day at the stadium and the band was warming up for their concert
7970088 nadal went over to the sound booth and yelled at them to turn the music off
7970089 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
7970090 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
7970091 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
7970092 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
7970093 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
7970094 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
7970095 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now
7970096 we have drills for fires and tornadoes this is just another tool for the toolbox
7970097 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness
7970098 i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out

7970100 you may not be interested in war but war is interested in you
7970101 right now it s coming along day by day getting out there and getting an opportunity to see how it feels these last few days i ve been out there practicing and doing a lot better and feeling good just hope that it continues williams said he has tried to accelerate his return from a lower left leg injury but understands that his long term health is more significant you want to be in there to make the plays and get the quarterback s relationship
7970102 but at the same time you don t want to go out there and do something to yourself that is detrimental so i m definitely taking it and being smart this time
7970103 con lislam che uccide che secondo me non islam autentico ma una perversione dellislam evidentemente non possibile alcun dialogo
7970104 in linea di principio la santa sede parla con tutti perch non ha e non vuole avere nemici certamente difficile parlare con chi uccide prima di aprire la bocca certo se si potesse con le parole far rinsavire i terroristi sarebbe molto bello ma dubito che sia possibile dobbiamo privilegiare il dialogo con lislam moderato e anche con le componenti islamiche che pur avendo una visione piuttosto rigida della propria fede rifuggono per dalluso della violenza

7970108 la necesidad de hacer el estado m s operativo y racionalizar el gasto p blico
7970109 a la fecha est impactando alrededor del noventa por ciento del presupuesto
7970110 la gobernadora decidi reducirlo al sesenta por ciento del presupuesto
7970111 en funci n de este porcentaje ser n las medidas correctivas para evitar un cambio que podr a llegar a ser mucho m s traum tico como el recorte de salarios o despido del personal
7970112 ya lo desment m s all de que no le di ning n tipo de trascendencia
7970113 se buscan argumentos de esta naturaleza para lograr alg n tipo de resquemor social pero no lo han logrado
7970114 luego el dato estad stico arroja el perfil para que el empleado p blico pueda acceder a uno u otro beneficio
7970115 la naci n no ha pedido nada de esto porque es absolutamente respetuosa de las autonom as provinciales pero s sugiere a todas las provincias y no solo a tierra del fuego que de alguna manera mantenga el equilibrio presupuestario con reducci n de gastos
7970116 no hay ninguna posibilidad de que se separe del cargo
7970117 ya lo desment ayer m s all de que no le di ning n tipo de trascendencia

7970119 no hubo ninguna discusi n con los ministros daniel lepez obras p blicas y roberto crocianelli econom a m s all de los debates propios en el seno de cualquier gabinete
7970120 cualquier grupo humano tiene discusiones pero de ninguna manera con un tenor tal como se plantea mucho menos que amerite una decisi n tan dr stica
7970121 con el ministro lepez adem s de compartir el gabinete soy amigo personal
7970122 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7970123 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7970124 we are extremely honored to help such a deserving charity
7970125 john is without a doubt the biggest will ferrell fan on the pga tour for john to be able to help will and cancer for college raise money for these deserving kids is a great honor we are certain the winning bidders with have a fantastic day with one of the games great rising stars
7970126 we are also deeply shocked and anguished to hear of the atrocities and violence meted out to the innocent christians and churches in orissa as a backlash of the sorrowful event
7970127 and we are praying for an immediate halt to the violence
7970128 what is most disturbing is that these attacks seem to be well organized and orchestrated
7970129 we have reports that the vhp have actually held strategy meetings in order to plan and coordinate this campaign of violence against peaceful christian families and churches
7970130 we thank god that the government officials are protecting our bible college campus and trying to protect our people
7970131 and now there is great tension prevailing and christians are running away for their lives
7970132 we must pray with all earnestness for the suffering church in orissa at this time

7970138 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7970139 an open time limit is not acceptable in any security deal that governs the presence of the international forces
7970140 whenever you win wars your troops come home and our troops will be coming home but it will be dictated by the conditions on the ground and the success or the lack of success
7970141 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory
7970142 emotionally honest friedman allows readers to experience things alongside him rather than merely gasp in awe at his heroics or sit clucking in judgment
7970143 a time to lead confirms the rewarding benefits of military service at a time when such service is experiencing considerable strain it also includes a comprehensive description of americas current national imperatives which deserve serious consideration

7970147 nous continuons nous opposer une r solution qui contient le mot g nocide
7970148 larm nie et la turquie doivent r soudre ce probl me non dans des forums politiques tels que le congr s ou des parlements
7970149 la communaut juive ne nie pas la souffrance des arm niens
7970150 ils taient en col re il y a un an mais aujourdhui ils semblent comprendre notre position
7970151 mon conseil est que la turquie fasse preuve de cr ativit et de pro activit dans le renforcement des relations avec larm nie comme une fa on de faire face au probl me cela entra nera une rencontre sur lhistoire
7970152 jai sugg r de trouver des moyens de travailler ensemble qui aideront changer latmosph re parce que nous nous pr occupons aujourdhui du bien tre de larm nie qui a besoin daide je pense que la communaut juive pourrait tre utile
7970153 le seul probl me est sur lutilisation du mot je pense que la communaut juive est plus int ress e aujourdhui aider am liorer la vie des arm niens vivant en arm nie plut t que de devenir des juges sur une question quils ne peuvent r soudre alors oui il existe une sympathie
7970154 il y a beaucoup de choses qui se disent en campagne politique
7970155 que pass cinq anciens secr taires d tat trois anciens secr taires de la d fense ainsi que le pr sident des tats unis sont intervenus au congr s pour d fendre ce quils pensaient tre la bonne d marche suivre personne ne peut nier lhistoire mais beaucoup de gens s rieux qui se pr occupent des arm niens et qui se soucient de la turquie disent que cest la meilleure fa on dagir et je ne pense pas que cela va changer
7970156 limportant est que les deux pays croient au r le de facilitateur de la turquie
7970157 je pense que le fait davoir gard le secret ce qui est presque un miracle ajoute la possibilit dun succ s personne ne sait si cela r ussira
7970158 mais le fait quun pays musulman soit capable de faire asseoir une m me table les deux parties est tr s important cest non seulement un symbole mais un espoir pour les d veloppements futurs
7970159 la relation strat gique entre les etats unis la turquie et isra l a ses propres r gles si cela va servir lint r t des parties cela se produira elle nest pas conditionn e sur les conflits r gionaux

7970175 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
7970176 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently
7970177 by restricting this benefit to only professional technical and skilled occupations the government is setting up a permanent underclass of unskilled temporary foreign workers who will be deprived of the rights to citizenship being extended only to elite workers
7970178 the great majority of temporary foreign workers in alberta do not fall into the privileged o a and b designated occupations
7970179 what mcgowan doesnt understand is the federal government is constipated
7970180 there are about 900 000 people waiting for admission to canada for landed immigrant status this is a six year backlog the system needs a laxative
7970181 if we assume 1 000 people come to alberta this is still a drop in the bucket
7970182 a lot of the way visa office decision making on refugees goes is there seems to be a kind of trend that goes on in decision making
7970183 the impression we get often is they kind of make generalizations or they make general decisions about what were going to say about the situation in the country of origin and theyre quite influenced about what the unhcr might say
7970184 we are seeing a trend toward voluntary repatriation to afghanistan it is a positive thing it has been going on several years and unhcr has been supporting it
7970185 it signals that there are places in afghanistan that people are able to go back to the vast majority of the people returning are from frontier provinces pakistan
7970186 we get lots of calls from overseas but also from friends and families here in canada but we dont have the capacity and also the acceptance rate is low the rate has dropped down because some of the reports coming from the government trying to paint a rosy picture of afghanistan

7970189 i take a big sigh because its been a really very long standing frustration weve had that we do not feel that the review or assessment that a refugee has or receives overseas is equivalent to or as consistent as what they might get in canada
7970190 through this project we hope to obtain information that will help improve the quality transparency and consistency in making and communicating decisions identify any visa officer training gaps develop working tools for visa officers and make recommendations with respect to ongoing quality assurance monitoring of the program

7970195 no dejamos escapar un talento lleve rastas camiseta o se presente al proceso de selecci n en vaqueros y deportivas
7970196 s existe una clara tendencia a la informalidad en el vestir pero no en los ltimos a os es un proceso de onda larga que se inici a finales del siglo xix y sin interrupci n la ley general es que nos vestimos cada vez peor
7970197 la tendencia es clara cada vez vestimos de una forma menos formal esta l nea de relajaci n est acorde con los tiempos
7970198 esa estricta lite que considera todav a una obligaci n y se recrea en ella el vestir con chaqueta y corbata las fronteras inamovibles ya no existen
7970199 cada vez son m s las empresas contin a que permiten a sus trabajadores vestir el viernes de forma casual como anticipo del fin de semana algo hasta hace poco impensable
7970200 una t mida evoluci n pero todav a dentro de la formalidad
7970201 est n fuera de lugar en el trabajo es una cuesti n de educaci n la convivencia supone aceptar unos c digos de conducta que creamos entre todos j venes y adultos el traje de chaqueta insiste puede ser muchas veces una liberaci n adem s de facilitar esa convivencia
7970202 no parece lo m s adecuado presentarse en zarzuela o en moncloa en pantal n bermudas
7970203 yo soy de la escuela cl sica contin a gonz lez urbaneja de los que piensan que existen unas normas de decoro y respeto hacia los dem s que hay que cumplir

7970206 la mayor a lo entendi y en el pleno siguiente no hubo ning n problema
7970207 i am back in moscow and i will not play in kiev and i can confirm i am going to tottenham
7970208 i am not waiting for a visa and as soon as it is granted i am ready to go to england and sign
7970209 juande ramos i have not yet met it seems like he will call me but i know for sure he is very interested in my services
7970210 i would prefer it if the deal was described as very close
7970211 at the moment the papers have not yet been signed we have only reached a verbal agreement with the england club
7970212 i was scared of my first match thats the first time ive felt pressure since the world championship
7970213 it was always going to be a tough match playing michael but i didnt expect to win 5 1
7970214 although it was 5 1 there were three frames decided on the black ball so winning them was massive
7970215 it was looking like 2 2 but i went 3 1 and never really looked back now ive got a match under my belt ill hopefully relax
7970216 ive not had the heart going like that for a while you never forget it but when it comes back its quite scary you realise youre under some pressure
7970217 id love to retain my title here this year ive got so many fond memories of winning here last year
7970218 i made it clear we cant make exceptions under the salary cap despite his status in the game
7970219 i used the example of someone like terry campese hes not in the top five players in the game but hes just as important to the raiders as greg is to the storm
7970220 one of the lessons we from the mark gasnier situation was to make sure the player knew the rules direct from us rather than the agent and the club
7970221 the nrl wasnt happy about gasnier and williams going but thats the good thing about gi theres some decency about him
7970222 ive spoken to frank at length and the football department and i believe them when they say he was genuinely injured
7970223 ive spoken to the club today and im confident hiss shoulders are no good
7970224 van der linde has an excellent disciplinary record on which to draw in mitigation
7970225 however the international rugby board has recently expressed its concern about the danger of unlawful and dangerous clearing out on the fringes of tackles rucks and mauls and the need for deterrence is clear and is a counter weight to any mitigation davidson said
7970226 im not surprised by anything in the game these days

7970293 nosso desejo que a decis o seja mantida que a reserva seja mantida com continuidade porque ela est plenamente de acordo com todos os procedimentos que foram feitos at hoje para a demarca o de terras ind genas achamos inclusive que se for determinada a descontinuidade por exemplo isso poder haver um contencioso infinito em rela o a outras demarca es que foram feitas
7970294 a decis o do supremo que vai nortear evidentemente as demais disputas que se dar o sejam em rela o a terras que ainda est o para serem demarcadas seja em rela o quelas que j foram demarcadas e est o regularizadas
7970295 n o v o ser por falta de a o civilizada t cnica e qualificada da pol cia federal que algum tipo de decis o vai deixar de ser cumprida n o vai faltar apoio evidentemente que qualquer a o da pol cia federal vai ficar demarcada pela decis o pela lei e pela constitui o

7970300 n o nenhum segredo e assim eu disse a meus colegas israelenses que n o acho que a atividade dos assentamentos ajude o processo de fato o que se requer agora s o passos que reforcem a confian a entre as partes
7970301 qualquer medida que abale a confian a deve ser evitada
7970302 basicamente antes da confer ncia de annapolis o processo de paz e as conversas se encontravam completamente paralisadas desde 2001
7970303 nosso apoio a uma ades o da r ssia omc e nossa convic o de que deveria entrar nela permanecem intactos

7970316 one day jesus told his disciples a story to illustrate their need for constant prayer and to show them that they must never give up there was a judge in a certain city he said who was a godless man with great contempt for everyone a widow of that city came to him repeatedly appealing for justice against someone who had harmed her the judge ignored her for a while but eventually she wore him out i fear neither god nor man he said to himself but this woman is driving me crazy im going to see that she gets justice because she is wearing me out with her constant requests then the lord said learn a lesson from this evil judge even he rendered a just decision in the end so dont you think god will surely give justice to his chosen people who plead with him day and night will he keep putting them off i tell you he will grant justice to them quickly but when i the son of man return how many will i find who have faith luke 18 1 8
7970317 nesses pactos foi assinalada a necessidade de um di logo internacional para decidir o futuro status dos territ rios da abkh zia e da oss tia do sul e para garantir a estabilidade na regi o

7970328 qu cruel diferencia en el trato a las familias de los militares muertos
7970329 nunca pidi que se investigara la identificaci n de 32 cad veres en 24 horas
7970330 tras 613 d as de larga espera pudimos exhumar y conseguir que cada familia tuviera su muerto le recordamos que a n hoy once familias no han podido recuperar a su fallecido porque ste hab a sido incinerado por otra familia
7970331 las partes tienen que poder acceder a las cajas negras y a las conversaciones de los pilotos
7970332 me dijo una vez que estas cosas de eta las arregla la derecha
7970333 en su proceso de negociaci n fueron sucios muy sucios
7970334 yo no coincido con los elogios al estado de derecho y la constituci n que hace otros como los socialistas que tambi n eran como nosotros la cara amarga en el franquismo para el pnv sta sigue siendo una democracia de baja calidad
7970335 veo en peligro el concierto vasco y veo en peligro el euskara por todo ese foll n indecente del manifiesto a favor del castellano
7970336 nunca he sido de eta pero pod a haberlo sido eta es de mi quinta y tengo amigos entre sus fundadores eran nacionalistas radicales y cat licos por cierto pero yo nunca tuve la tentaci n de meterme
7970337 yo siempre he procurado que madrid negocie con esta gente pero no he visto ninguna tregua sincera de verdad los etarras viven mal y no son cobardes simplemente est n acosados
7970338 la palabra confiar en pol tica deber a estar desterrada nadie se f a de nadie
7970339 me dijo una vez que estas cosas de eta las arregla la derecha y que el tema del ira lo empez la se ora thatcher eso lo interpret como que l pensaba que quer a y pod a terminar con eta empezamos apoy ndole en la investidura llegamos a un acuerdo fruct fero y fuimos serios hasta el final
7970340 hab a otros no s lo mayor oreja que le hicieron cambiar de opini n ah nos distanciamos y entramos en lizarra

7970342 no voy a ser pol ticamente correcto don juan carlos tiene una gran aureola pero yo nunca lo acept ni lo aceptar como rey le hicieron rey con un decreto franquista y eso no se ha subsanado simplemente lo metieron por la puerta de atr s en la constituci n y para un dem crata eso es inaceptable
7970343 el rey estuvo esperando sali en televisi n y todo el mundo le atribuy a l que hab a liquidado el golpe mi convicci n es que no fue l
7970344 el poder central necesita fabricarse un enemigo pero eso a m no me molesta
7970345 lo que me molestar a es que me hubiera pasado lo de imaz que hablen bien desde madrid de m a m intentaron desacreditarme y luego comprarme y si no te pueden comprar te liquidan moralmente
7970346 no le voy a decir ni qui n ni por cu nto
7970347 la izquierda act a en relaci n a la derecha igual que la derecha en relaci n a la izquierda
7970348 uno de los muchos errores del ex presidente aznar y su se ora
7970349 hay que contextualizarlo no fue una ma ana de agosto tranquila era un d a en que est bamos millones de espa oles doloridos por las acciones de eta

7970371 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability

7970374 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation

7970433 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
7970434 the first idea of building the semantic desktop arose from the fact that one of our colleagues could not remember the girlfriends of his friends
7970435 because they kept changing you know how it is the point is you have a vast amount of information on your desktop hidden in files hidden in emails hidden in the names and structures of your folders nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information
7970436 in terms of usability and public impact it is of great interest
7970437 workspaces that connect to other workspaces and help you in your day to day activities of collecting information structuring it making sense of it and creating new information and communicating it
7970438 but not much for the users eye so far we only use it for tags ratings and comments as well as metadata cached from files for fast searches in 4 1 you only see the tagging and rating interfaces in apps like dolphin or gwenview
7970439 experimental tools exist that allow you to relate people to files pictures for example or other people or to tag web sites but in the future neomuk is supposed to be combined with way more applications important of course are the kde pim applications such as kmail and kaddressbook kmail developers for example have plans to provide virtual email folders through nepomuk also a service will extract contacts from kde pim and link them to emails im accounts and dates and thus provide an abstract view of the people you know
7970440 there should be no distinction for you between an email address and an im account
7970441 there are so many ideas in my head and not only in mine
7970442 so its an end in itself certainly it offers new ways of building applications and we certainly hope that will fly
7970443 because it provides an environment that makes it easy to annotate your information and because it helps you in maintaining your information which means we have a very personal motivation to annotate your information and then we have the initial starting point

7970489 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7970490 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7970491 the right to determine whether or not we are given access to a number of sensitive documents related to the arms deal
7970492 if godi decides in the mistaken belief that he has the power to do so to stop me from seeing these documents he can rest assured that i will address the matter directly with the speaker and following that consider all other options
7970493 godi has no right to determine whether or not a fellow member of parliament is allowed access to these documents a number of former and current members of scopa have previously accessed these documents without the permission of the scopa chair but rather with the assent of the speaker of parliament
7970494 i did so in the belief that these documents may well expose possible wrongdoing associated with the arms deal or at the very least point the way to doing so

7970548 we may be on the verge of a turning point in the battle against abortion
7970549 response to our call for communities to participate in this falls 40 days for life campaign has exceeded our wildest expectations
7970550 were especially pleased to see three canadian cities joining 40 days for life this fall

7970552 the growth of this outreach is a reflection of the excitement that people are expressing about the many ways 40 days for life impacts a community this program is being embraced by cities conducting their first 40 days for life and those who are planning their second third or in the case of bryan college station texas fourth campaign
7970553 planned parenthood is a special concern because it is the nations largest abortion provider

7970555 we hope to share the truth about what abortion does to every community where it is practiced and to make this fall the beginning of the end of abortion in america
7970556 fidelis warned late last month that a pro abortion catholic choice as a vice presidential candidate would offend many catholics who have struggled with the scandal of prominent pro abortion catholic politicians like senator biden
7970557 barack obama picks long time abortion advocate joe biden as running mate
7970558 barack obama selected one of the senates most ardent abortion advocates as his vice presidential running mate in joe biden obama has someone whose abortion views mirror his own by supporting unlimited abortions and wanting judges who will keep all abortions legal 35 more years
7970559 obama has been under fire for weeks for his strongly pro abortion views favoring taxpayer funded abortions opposing a partial birth abortion ban and opposing a bill in the illinois legislature that would protect newborns who survive abortions
7970560 biden is a fierce abortion proponent and someone who has made a reputation out of badgering supreme court nominees about abortion during confirmation hearings
7970561 in fact before he dropped out of the democratic primary race obama eventually won biden confirmed he would have a pro abortion litmus test for his own possible judicial picks
7970562 joe biden makes it easier for catholics to oppose pro abortion barack obama
7970563 a pro life catholic group says it will be easier for catholic voters to reject barack obama as president now that he has strong abortion advocate joe biden on board
7970564 burch the head of the pro life organization fidelis tells lifenews com that bidens pro abortion views like obamas pose a major challenge for american catholics
7970565 fidelis warned late last month that a pro abortion catholic choice as a vice presidential candidate would offend many catholics who have struggled with the scandal of prominent pro abortion catholic politicians like senator biden
7970566 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician burch said
7970567 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion he added
7970568 bidens own bishop bishop michael saltarelli of wilmington delaware has said that the issues pertaining to the sanctity of human life are the great civil rights issues of this generation
7970569 bishop saltarelli denounced the notion that politicians like biden can personally oppose abortion but refuse to pass laws protecting the unborn
7970570 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant
7970571 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7970572 in fact bishop saltarelli made clear that pro abortion catholic politicians should refrain from receiving the eucharist
7970573 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful he said
7970574 at church on sunday a friend who immigrated from france many years ago approached me to express amazement at what had happened the night before at rick warrens saddleback church it would have been unthinkable he said even for the dwindling numbers of devout christians in france that candidates for the nations highest office should appear in a church to be interviewed by its pastor for a national television audience i replied that while the particulars of the saddleback forum i e its dual interview format were unprecedented the event was well within an american tradition of political activity by people of faith and their religious leaders and of presidential candidates appealing to such people as important sectors of the voting public no established church to be sure we americans taught the world that one but no chasm either between religious sensibilities and political ones
7970575 jefferson wrote can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of god
7970576 mccain and obama chatting individually with a preacher in a public forum about their positions on evil and their relationship with jesus christ
7970577 for years those seeking the presidency have appeared in churches and before religious audiences giving prepared speeches aimed at establishing that they and their audience are on the same page where worldly matters are concerned warren invited mccain and obama to do something tougher than that to take questions that would perhaps more reliably elicit the same information before the forum not knowing much about rick warren i wondered how it would go id say now that it went very well maybe next they can be interviewed by raymond arroyo of ewtn or by talk radios dennis prager or michael medved who might be said to represent other sectors of religiously motivated voters
7970578 the constitution of course forbade religious tests for public office even before the first amendment was added but this was all about forbidding the government from imposing any legal bar to a persons eligibility to office on religious grounds it was not about forbidding the governed when they elect public officials to take a candidates spiritual health into account examples as various as thomas jefferson abraham lincoln and ronald reagan suggest that americans are perfectly capable of assessing such matters without invidiously discriminating against candidates with fairly tenuous connections if any to any particular church part of the religious freedom we prize is the freedom to vote on religiously motivated grounds part of the responsibility that comes with that freedom is the obligation not to vote on narrowly sectarian grounds americans have done pretty well with that whole package
7970579 was the saddleback forum a step away from the american tradition of balancing religious freedom non establishment and a concern for the moral and spiritual condition of the country and its leaders on the contrary i think it was comfortably within that tradition
7970580 man cannot be separated from god nor politics from morality
7970581 this split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age
7970582 t he lay catholics duty to be morally coherent is one and indivisible there cannot be two parallel lives on the one hand the so called spiritual life with its values and demands and on the other the so called secular life that is life in a family at work in social responsibilities in the responsibilities of public life and in culture
7970583 guided by a christian conscience in conformity with its values
7970584 their proper task is infusing the temporal order with christian values all the while respecting the nature and rightful autonomy of that order and cooperating with other citizens according to their particular competence and responsibility
7970585 a kind of cultural relativism exists today evident in the conceptualization and defence of an ethical pluralism which sanctions the decadence and disintegration of reason and the principles of the natural moral law
7970586 complete autonomy with regard to their moral choices and lawmakers are respecting this freedom of choice by enacting laws which ignore the principles of natural ethics and yield to ephemeral cultural and moral trends as if every possible outlook on life were of equal value
7970587 the value of tolerance is disingenuously invoked when a large number of citizens catholics among them are asked not to base their contribution to society and political life through the legitimate means available to everyone in a democracy on their particular understanding of the human person and the common good
7970588 t he history of the twentieth century demonstrates that those citizens were right who recognized the falsehood of relativism and with it the notion that there is no moral law rooted in the nature of the human person which must govern our understanding of man the common good and the state
7970589 the legitimate freedom of catholic citizens to choose among the various political opinions that are compatible with faith and the natural moral law and to select according to their own criteria what best corresponds to the needs of the common good
7970590 political freedom is not and cannot be based upon the relativistic idea that all conceptions of the human persons good have the same value and truth
7970591 it is based on the fact that politics are concerned with very concrete realizations of the true human and social good in given historical geographic economic technological and cultural contexts from the specificity of the task at hand and the variety of circumstances a plurality of morally acceptable policies and solutions arises it is not the churchs task to set forth specific political solutions and even less to propose a single solution as the acceptable one to temporal questions that god has left to the free and responsible judgment of each person it is however the churchs right and duty to provide a moral judgment on temporal matters when this is required by faith or the moral law
7970592 if christians must recognize the legitimacy of differing points of view about the organization of worldly affairs they are also called to reject as injurious to democratic life a conception of pluralism that reflects moral relativism democracy must be based on the true and solid foundation of non negotiable ethical principles which are the underpinning of life in society
7970593 john paul ii continuing the constant teaching of the church has reiterated many times that those who are directly involved in lawmaking bodies have a grave and clear obligation to oppose any law that attacks human life for them as for every catholic it is impossible to promote such laws or to vote for them
7970594 when political activity comes up against moral principles that do not admit of exception compromise or derogation the catholic commitment becomes more evident and laden with responsibility in the face of fundamental and inalienable ethical demands christians must recognize that what is at stake is the essence of the moral law which concerns the integral good of the human person this is the case with laws concerning abortion and euthanasia not to be confused with the decision to forgo extraordinary treatments which is morally legitimate such laws must defend the basic right to life from conception to natural death
7970595 to fulfill their duties faithfully in the spirit of the gospel
7970596 i t is a mistake to think that because we have here no lasting city but seek the city which is to come we are entitled to shirk our earthly responsibilities this is to forget that by our faith we are bound all the more to fulfill these responsibilities according to the vocation of each
7970597 the opportunity to carry out their earthly activity in such a way as to integrate human domestic professional scientific and technical enterprises with religious values under whose supreme direction all things are ordered to the glory of god
7970598 it would be a mistake to confuse the proper autonomy exercised by catholics in political life with the claim of a principle that prescinds from the moral and social teaching of the church
7970599 by its interventions in this area the churchs magisterium does not wish to exercise political power or eliminate the freedom of opinion of catholics regarding contingent questions
7970600 a law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
7970601 intended for national purposes such as public prayer thanksgiving funeral orations etc and assigned to the special use of no particular sect of denomination but equally open to all
7970602 t he general principles on which the fathers achieved independence were the general principles of christianity
7970603 the american population is entirely christian and with us christianity and religion are identified it would be strange indeed if with such a people our institutions did not presuppose christianity and did not often refer to it and exhibit relations to it
7970604 we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a supreme being when the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs it follows the best of our traditions for it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs to hold that it may not would be to find in the constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups that would prefer those who believe in no religion over those who do believe w e find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence
7970605 t he american constitutions contain no provisions which prohibit the authorities from such solemn recognition of a superintending providence in public transactions and exercises as the general religious sentiment of mankind inspires whatever may be the shades of religious belief all must acknowledge the fitness of recognizing in important human affairs the superintending care and control of the great governor of the universe and of acknowledging with thanksgiving his boundless favors or bowing in contrition when visited with the penalties of his broken laws
7970606 no principle of constitutional law is violated when thanksgiving or fast days are appointed when chaplains are designated for the army and navy when legislative sessions are opened with prayer or the reading of the scriptures or when religious teaching is encouraged by a general exemption of the houses of religious worship from taxation
7970607 foster religious worship and religious institutions as conservators of the public morals and valuable if not indispensable assistants to the preservation of the public order
7970608 the same reasons of state policy which induce the government to aid institutions of charity and seminaries of instruction
7970609 religion morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged
7970610 let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion
7970611 to exclude all rivalry among christian sects and to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment
7970612 very different from the right to force the consciences of other men or to punish them for worshipping god in the manner which they believe their accountability to him requires
7970613 wholly distinct from that of the right of private judgment in matters of religion and of the freedom of public worship according to the dictates of ones conscience
7970614 the right of a society or government to interfere in matters of religion will hardly be contested by any persons who believe that piety religion and morality are intimately connected with the well being of the state and indispensable to the administration of civil justice
7970615 an attempt to level all religions and to make it a matter of state policy to hold all in utter indifference would have created universal disapprobation if not universal indignation
7970616 when the first amendment was pending in congress in substantially its present form mr
7970617 we have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion avarice ambition revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly inadequate to the government of any other
7970618 religion is the only solid base of morals and morals are the only possible support of free governments
7970619 teach the precepts of religion and the duties of man to god
7970620 it has pleased the great governor of the world god to incline the hearts of the legislatures represented by the drafters to approve of and to authorize them to ratify the said articles
7970621 by a sincere repentance and amendment of life to appease gods righteous displeasure and through the merits of jesus christ to obtain his pardon and forgiveness
7970622 to testify their gratitude to god for his goodness by a cheerful obedience to his laws and by promoting each in his station and by his influence the practice of true and undefiled religion which is the great foundation of public prosperity and national happiness
7970623 no person demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious sentiments in the said territory
7970624 r eligion morality and knowledge are necessary to good government and to the happiness of mankind
7970625 the clause speaks of an establishment of religion what is meant by that expression it referred without doubt to the establishment which existed in the mother country its meaning is to be ascertained by ascertaining what that establishment was it was the connection with the state of a particular religious society by its endowment at public expense in exclusion of or in preference to any other by giving to is members exclusive political rights and by compelling the attendance of those who rejected its communion upon its worship or religious observances these three particulars constituted that union of church and state of which our ancestors were so justly jealous and against which they so wisely and carefully provided
7970626 utterly opposed to any constraint upon the rights of conscience
7970627 had no fear or jealousy of religion itself nor did they wish to see us an irreligious people they did not intend to spread over all the public authorities and the whole public action of the nation the dead and revolting spectacle of atheistic apathy not so had the battles of the revolution been fought and the deliberations of the revolutionary congress conducted
7970628 what is an establishment of religion it must have a creed defining what a man must believe it must have rights and ordinances which believers must observe it must have ministers of defined qualifications to teach the doctrines and administer the rites it must have tests for the submissive and penalties for the nonconformist there never was an establishment of religion without all these
7970629 it is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of almighty god to obey his will to be grateful for his benefits and humbly to implore his protection and favor
7970630 to recommend to the people of the united states a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many and signal favors of almighty god especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness
7970631 accordingly washington designated a day for devotion to god acknowledged god as
7970632 unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks for his kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to their becoming a nation for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of his providence in the course and conclusion of the late war for the great degree of tranquility union and plenty which we have since enjoyed for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been able to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness and particularly the national one now lately instituted for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge and in general for all the great and various favors which he has been pleased to confer upon us
7970633 unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great lord and ruler of nations
7970634 render our national government a blessing to all the people by constantly being a government of wise just and constitutional laws discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed
7970635 to protect and guide all sovereigns and nations especially such as have show n kindness to us and to bless them with good governments peace and concord to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue and the increase of science among them and us and generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as h alone knows to be best
7970636 the whole american people declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
7970637 f or the sole use of christian indians and the moravian brethen missionaries for civilizing the indians and promoting christianity
7970638 it is increasingly clear that president bush does not have a strategy for victory in iraq rather he hopes to prevent defeat and pass the problem along to his successor
7970639 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs while leaving the central government in charge of common interests
7970640 fourth the president must direct the military to design a plan for withdrawing and redeploying our troops from iraq by 2008
7970641 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7970642 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7970643 such a person if he would assume the vice presidency post would not serve to improve iraq usa relations
7970644 biden has made his iraq dismemberment plan the centerpiece of his 2008 candidacy

7970693 i have not heard of a single socialist party member who supports the obama campaign and such support would be in violation of the socialist party constitution which states article vi section 2 that socialist party members may support candidates of other political parties only in the absence of a socialist party candidate since the socialist party has a presidential ticket any members who support other presidential campaigns are doing so without our sanction and in violation of our constitution the socialist party is completely independent of the democratic party and does not support it or its candidates including barack obama complete independence from the democratic party is a central element of the socialist partys identity and principles http socialistparty usa org principles html you may be aware that in the 1960s and 1970s a significant portion of the socialist party advocated operating within the democratic party in 1972 1973 those groups formed two separate organizations to pursue that program social democrats usa which is now defunct and democratic socialists of america which operates to some extent as a socialist caucus within the democratic party those who remained in the socialist party were opposed to that strategy and dedicated to restoring the socialist party to full independence from the democratic party

7970757 it seems entirely unfair that apple are being so inconsistent about censorship so i can pay for and download a blackly humorous cartoon or a movie full of stylized violence but not a similarly themed comicbook
7970758 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7970759 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7970760 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala

7970763 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7970764 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7970765 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7970766 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7970767 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7970768 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7970769 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
7970770 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep others spirits up

7970824 determining the probable collapse sequence for wtc 7 nist found that the impact of debris from the collapse of wtc 1 ignited fires on at least 10 floors of wtc 7 and the fires burned out of control on six lower floors
7970825 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
7970826 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures
7970827 in order for the thermate reaction to melt steel to take place there has to be materials if you look at the amount needed at least 100 pounds for one column you need someone to get that amount in the building and place it and for the reaction to take place it is unlikely
7970828 substantial evidence that aluminothermic thermite materials were present at the wtc jones 2007 and the presense of such materials can explain the existence of intense fire where it would not otherwise have existed
7970829 regardless of how thermite materials were installed in the wtc it is strange that nist has been so blind to any such possibility in fact when reading nists reports on the wtc and its periodic responses to faqs from the public one might get the idea that no one in the nist organization had ever heard of nano thermites before but the truth is many of the scientists and organizations involved in the nist wtc investigation were not only well aware of nano thermites they actually had considerable connection to and some cases expertise in this exact technology
7970830 and we will look at what you have to say
7970831 we asked ourselves what is the minimum amount of charge we could use to bring the building down and we found that even the smallest charge would release an extremely loud sound heard half a mile away there were no reports of such a sound numerous observers and video recordings found the collapse to be relatively quiet
7970832 yeah i was just standing there ya know we were watching the building wtc 7 actually cuz it was on fire the bottom floors of the building were on fire and we heard this sound that sounded like a clap of thunder turned around we were shocked to see that the building was ah well it looked like there was a shockwave ripping through the building and the windows all busted out it was horrifying about a second later the bottom floor caved out and the building followed after that we saw the building crash down all the way to the ground we were in shock
7970833 if it doesnt fit our hypothesis than you must acquit
7970834 as far as cruise missiles are concerned they are strategic arms and have a range of 2 500 km the black sea is just a pool for them
7970835 so far weve seen a series of unfortunate decisions by the russians that only serve to further isolate them and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
7970836 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
7970837 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7970838 we believe those to be family members of the targeted militant mullah sadiq he was important for us to target
7970839 if they are willing to completely end their ties with us nothing horrible will happen for russia
7970840 we have been developing partnership ties with nato for quite a long time but we do not need illusions of partnership we a ready to make any decision including the one that will end the relationship in general
7970841 this does not mean that we must stop our strategic moves towards the wto but one has to clarify relations with partners
7970842 esto ha llegado a un extremo en el cual el sistema definitivamente es inviable y debe terminarse es preferible que el gobierno se ponga rojo de una vez en vez de ponerse rosado cada 30 d as
7970843 635 millones de d lares es mucha plata en especial si se considera que antes de que ricardo lagos dise ara y que este gobierno echara a andar el transantiago la locomoci n colectiva de la capital no le costaba un peso al estado no gravaba a las regiones y era sustentada completamente por peque os y medianos empresarios chilenos a los cuales este viciado proyecto lanz a la ruina
7970844 lo que lleva perdido el transantiago desde su inicio es particularmente costoso para las regiones en el caso de la araucan a estos 635 millones de d lares equivalen a 10 a os del presupuesto completo del municipio de temuco m s a n equivalen a 146 a os del presupuesto municipal de imperial 163 a os del presupuesto municipal de carahue y 195 a os del presupuesto municipal de freire
7970845 la fortuna dilapidada en el transantiago desde febrero del a o pasado a la fecha habr a servido para financiar 47 mil subsidios del fondo solidario de vivienda o 19 mil kil metros de caminos ripiados o 1 900 kil metros de defensas ribere as o 76 mil subsidios habitacionales para el pueblo mapuche
7970846 since the united states is a permanent member of the u n security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the security council
7970847 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into georgia and nothing else
7970848 we cant allow what russia has done to go without there being some consequences we have not yet determined what those consequences will be from our standpoint but as i said we are looking at a number of possibilities
7970849 continues not to honour the commitments that the russians have signed onto
7970850 so far weve seen a series of unfortunate decisions by the russians that only serve to further isolate them
7970851 and we hope that they hear the loud voices from the international community and understand that its not in their long term interests to take these kinds of actions
7970852 weve made it very clear to the russians what our purpose in mission is there
7970853 we are not anticipating any problems with our ability to deliver humanitarian assistance
7970854 were grateful that the legislature gave us the opportunity to fund these projects
7970855 the six pilot projects should go a long way toward helping us find ways to reduce these costs textbooks are a significant investment these days if we can lighten our students financial burden they may be able to graduate with less debt

7970969 more than half of the papers selected for this project have never been microfilmed so in the past only well credentialed scholars would be allowed to use and access these rare and fragile issues
7970970 for example one of the papers is one issue from 1832 of the texas gazette and brazoria commercial advertiser the only surviving example of this newspaper
7970971 nine publishers printed newspapers between 1819 and 1836 but only the telegraph amp texas register was still in publication at the time of the texas revolution it became the paper of record for the republic of texas and played a major role in keeping citizens informed
7970972 the collection of newspapers proposed for microfilming and digitization provide critical information regarding the early history of texas both as a republic and a state
7970973 as a republican i stand before you with deep respect for the history and traditions of my political party
7970974 in troubled times it was understood that country comes before party that in perilous moments mutual concern for the national interest must be the only factor in political judgments
7970975 the party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values
7970976 america has seldom faced more critical choices whether we should maintain an occupational force for decades in a country and region that resents western intervention or elect a leader who in a carefully structured way will bring our troops home from iraq as the heroes they are
7970977 whether it is prudent to borrow from future generations to pay for todays reckless fiscal policies or elect a leader who will shore up our budgets and return to a strong dollar
7970978 hence i stand before you proud of my partys contributions to american history but as a citizen proud as well of the good judgment of good people in this good party in nominating a transcending candidate an individual whom i am convinced will recapture the american dream and be a truly great president the senator from abraham lincolns state barack obama thank you

7971122 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
7971123 as evidenced by some of the comments on this blog during the ie7 days many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
7971124 while you browse the web your ie keeps a local record of which third party items your browser accesses and where they were accessed from
7971125 inprivate blocking keeps a record of third party items like the one above as you browse when you choose to browse with inprivate ie automatically blocks sites that have seen you across more than 10 sites

7971129 the difficulty with listeriosis is that the food can look taste and smell normal so you wont know the infection is there weeks after you purchased the contaminated products
7971130 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
7971131 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked to the outbreak
7971132 we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be received from provincial territorial and federal partners
7971133 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
7971134 this is a serious concern thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
7971135 i think we all feel tremendously for those who have been affected by this terrible development and i want to express my condolences to those families that have been affected

7971139 871 plus or minus 2 meaning the date that the structures that were recently unearthed and preserved were probably originally constructed the exhibit is a marvel of interactive technology go see it
7971140 a date which we must already establish for the trial to begin for the good of justice itself for the people and for the accused
7971141 it remains to this day the greatest of the discoveries of physiology and its whole honor belongs to harvey
7971142 if you include a portion of an artery between two ligatures and slit it open lengthwise you will find nothing but blood
7971143 the blood of all animals palpitates within their veins meaning the arteries and by the pulse is sent everywhere simultaneously
7971144 thus do all the veins pulsate together and by successive strokes because they all depend upon the heart and as it is always in motion so are they likewise always moving together but by successive movements
7971145 that the effect is so that the blood is prepared in the liver and is thence transferred to the heart to receive its proper form and last perfection a statement which does not appear devoid of reason for no great and perfect work is ever accomplished at a single effort or receives its final polish from one instrument but if this be actually so then show us another vessel which draws the absolutely perfect blood from the heart and distributes it as the arteries do the spirits over the whole body
7971146 that all the arteries of the body arise from the great artery and that this takes its origin from the heart that all these vessels naturally contain and carry blood that the three semilunar valves situated at the orifice of the aorta prevent the return of the blood into the heart and that nature never connected them with this the most noble viscus of the body unless for some important end
7971147 inheres in the very constitution of the heart and appears from the beginning as is learned both from the dissection of living animals and the formation of the chick in the egg
7971148 there is everywhere a mutual anastomosis and inosculation of the arteries with the veins and they severally transmit both blood and spirit by certain invisible and undoubtedly very narrow passages now if the mouth of the pulmonary artery had stood in like manner continually open and nature had found no contrivance for closing it when requisite and opening it again it would have been impossible that the blood could ever have passed by the invisible and delicate mouths during the contractions of the thorax into the arteries for all things are not alike readily attracted or repelled but that which is light is more readily drawn in the instrument being dilated and forced out again when it is contracted than that which is heavy and in like manner is anything drawn more rapidly along an ample conduit and again driven forth than it is through a narrow tube but when the thorax is contracted the pulmonary veins which are in the lungs being driven inwardly and powerfully compressed on every side immediately force out some of the spirit they contain and at the same time assume a certain portion of blood by those subtle mouths a thing that could never come to pass were the blood at liberty to flow back into the heart through the great orifice of the pulmonary artery but its return through this great opening being prevented when it is compressed on every side a certain portion of it distils into the pulmonary veins by the minute orifices mentioned
7971149 the more the thorax contracts the more it strives to force out the blood the more exactly do these membranes viz the semilunar valves close up the mouth of the vessel and suffer nothing to regurgitate
7971150 were there no valves a threefold inconvenience would result so that the blood would then perform this lengthened course in vain it would flow inwards during the disastoles of the lungs and fill all their arteries but in the systoles in the manner of the tide it would ever and anon like the euripus flow backwards and forwards by the same way with a reciprocating motion which would nowise suit the blood this however may seem a matter of little moment but if it meantime appear that the function of respiration suffer then i think it would be looked upon as no trifle etc
7971151 and then a third inconvenience by no means to be thought lightly of would follow were the blood moved backwards during the expirations had not our maker instituted those supplementary membranes
7971152 that they the valves have all a common use and that it is to prevent regurgitation or backward motion each however having a proper function the one set drawing matters from the heart and preventing their return the other drawing matters into the heart and preventing their escape from it for nature never intended to distress the heart with needless labour neither to bring aught into the organ which it had been better to have kept away nor to take from it again aught which it was requisite should be brought since then there are four orifices in all two in either ventricle one of these induces the other educes
7971153 farther since there is one vessel which consists of a simple covering implanted in the heart and another which is double extending from it galen is here speaking of the right side of the heart but i extend his observations to the left side also a kind of reservoir had to be provided to which both belonging the blood should be drawn in by one and sent out by the other

7971165 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7971166 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening

7971385 the bill legislates in five main areas to improve education and skills first it will make it compulsory by 2015 for all young people to participate in some form of education or training at least part time until they are 18 years old secondly it will make various provisions to encourage enable and assist young peoples participation thirdly it will give adults certain rights to expect skills training and enable analysis to take place of the quality and value of such training fourthly it will make a number of changes to the inspection and regulatory regime for independent schools and non maintained special schools fifthly it will help to ensure a fair and transparent admissions system to schools both pre and post 16
7971386 those of us who believe that education is a good in itself share the governments hopes that the bill will go some way towards improving the approach that we in this country take to learning and acquiring skills
7971387 making our job here all the more important and the consultation process is open to question although i shall come back to that
7971388 much of what the government are trying to achieve would be unnecessary if only standards in our schools were better as the minister acknowledged the government announced today that they have given local authorities 50 days to come up with a plan of action for their worst performing secondary schools although i am slightly at a loss as to why the possibility of their becoming academies is seen as a threat
7971389 all the statistics show that the qualifications one obtains by the age of 18 are a good predictor of future life chances and income prospects however the minister will not be surprised to learn that we take issue with him on some of the ways in which the government propose to achieve this desirable outcome
7971390 despite the governments assurances about criminal records i am still concerned about the duty in the bill to disclose the offences and the effect it might have on a young persons future prospects
7971391 much has been made of our 24th position out of 29 in the oecd league tables but if those tables are looked at it will be seen that our failure is above all in the intermediate and lower ends of the spectrum
7971392 we have all recognised that with the complex choices that have to be made careers guidance is absolutely vital we talked about the connexions service and the mentoring of the neet programme but careers guidance to our young people in schools who are making choices at the age of 12 and 13 between apprenticeships diplomas and gcses or a level is absolutely vital yet because of the degree to which the connexion service has shifted from providing careers guidance to the mentoring service we have reached a situation in which the careers guidance service has effectively collapsed we have more or less to establish it from scratch
7971393 we need also to act on the concerns of the noble lord lord low in developing the apprenticeship matching service a lot of work is going on to make sure that apprenticeships are not perceived as conforming to stereotypical sex roles
7971394 we believe strongly that the culture change we are expecting as a result of this legislation which makes a commitment to have young people in education until the age of 18 will be a positive step forward for all young people including those with disabilities
7971395 are an incredible storytelling tool one that filmmakers should embrace instead of reject in the next ten years theyll yield a couple of narrative masterpieces

7971401 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7971402 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know
7971403 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7971404 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago
7971405 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
7971406 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
7971407 that debate in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years
7971408 it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
7971409 its been pretty clear thats been automatic moment of conception
7971410 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7971411 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7971412 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
7971413 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being
7971414 its easy to sit back and watch things happen its a lot harder to stand up and make them not happen
7971415 i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted

7971422 pressure is mounting on gordon brown to find help for hard pressed families as the new deputy governor of the bank of england warned that the financial situation was at least as bad as that of the 1970s
7971423 the great wall street bailout of 2008 keeps growing for bear stearns 30 billion u s perhaps as much as 100 billion for fannie mae and freddie mac tens of billions of dollars in discounted short term loans to investment banks and lower interest rates for everyone so where will it all end in a dark hole of moral hazard unless the united states overhauls and strengthens its financial system and thats according to one of the key architects of the bailout
7971424 considering options in relation to pre charge detention in terrorist cases
7971425 we should not return to the previous 90 day proposal rejected by the house
7971426 200 groupings or networks and about 2 000 individuals being monitored by the police and the security service in the uk alone
7971427 270 computers 2 000 computer discs and a total of 8 224 exhibits
7971428 deserve our support as parliamentarians in providing the tools that they need to pursue to investigate and to prosecute
7971429 however the proposal to extend detention without charge up to 42 days gives up essential liberties without delivering any additional even temporary safety in fact it is likely to make us less not more safe
7971430 making terrorism an aggravating factor in sentencing notification requirements for those convicted of terrorist offences and travel restrictions on those convicted of terrorist offences
7971431 the risk of miscarriages of justice with such devastating and counter productive consequences is magnified when we give the police excessive powers which they will inevitably exercise under conditions of high public political and media pressure as will happen after a terrorist event
7971432 secretary of state should not have the right directly to appoint or dismiss a special coroner and why juries are an essential part of the process of reaching judgments of fact particularly in cases of death in custody

7971436 required to enable the enlarged eu of 27 member states to work effectively
7971437 the government are convinced that britains membership and full engagement with the european union is good for britain and good for europe and we believe that the treaty is good for britain and good for europe too
7971438 the trouble with the bill and the treaty is that they fly in the face of that british aspiration to create an outward looking rather than an inward looking europe
7971439 without any of the consultation of the people that was promised at the last election brazenly abrogating the commitment made by every party in the house to hold a national referendum in this event
7971440 the conservatives remain in the most ludicrous position of any political party in europe always willing the enlargement end and always opposing the enlargement means
7971441 the treaty which we will discuss for the weeks ahead reflects the fact that europes structures have not kept pace with that global and european transformation
7971442 proposes the repeal of more than 250 whole acts and the removal of obsolete provisions from nearly 70 others

7971444 as the most far reaching of any sub regional instrument for achieving gender equality
7971445 providing a guiding framework for our collective efforts to ensure a media in the region that is not guilty of censorship through the silencing of half of our regions population
7971446 critical citizens and a responsive media are not only key to achieving gender equality but also to building democracy in our region
7971447 i sorted and gave away 50 pounds of old clothes this week

7971454 i answered gods call its not my fault that the church didnt stay on the line
7971455 this has caused in some quarters a huge animosity towards muslims as a whole
7971456 that is tremendously unfair because those fanatics responsible represent a very tiny fraction of the whole and the vast majority of muslims are peace loving family orientated hard working and just want to get on with their lives as you do its important if you are to do justice in this case to put immediately to one side any bias any prejudice that you may feel
7971457 bear in mind whatever mr rizvi may have announced in the mosque based upon his understanding of the law in this country mr rizvi is not a lawyer is not a judge its not the law of this country that the use of a zanjeer by somebody under 16 is illegal you have to judge each individual situation on its own merits
7971458 children under 16 are not allowed by law to buy cigarettes its unlawful for a man to have sexual intercourse for a girl under 16 the idea being to protect girls from certain people like the gary glitters of this world
7971459 current policy is neither efficient nor delivering good human and environmental health
7971460 we are becoming a third world country in public toileting
7971461 other countries do better so why should british children suffer we can end our child poverty shame and we must
7971462 the british medical association is very worried about alcohol consumption among young people particularly young girls it is shocking that in europe the uks teenagers are most likely to be heavy drinkers
7971463 shamefully britain remains stuck at the bottom of the international league tables when it comes to social mobility
7971464 it is appalling that young peoples life chances are still so tied to the fortunes of their parents and that this situation has not improved over the last three decades
7971465 uk citizens know the transport system lags behind those in europe the uks congested network would do better with a dose of european medicine showing how to run a truly joined up transport system
7971466 lack of discipline as the root cause of anti social behaviour
7971467 not only do we send a higher proportion of our own citizens to prison than any other western european country we also trump turkey armenia and bulgaria in the imprisonment stakes
7971468 unless we have employment protection parity with other european countries uk workers will continue to be the soft touch when it comes to slashing jobs
7971469 in the uk binge drinking accounts for 40 of all drinking occasions by men and 22 by women
7971470 the procedure is well accepted in the uk and the laws are not restrictive but people cannot afford it
7971471 no other eu country has such a poor supply record despite the scale of the price rises in the uk and one of the most market oriented housing systems in europe
7971472 car use is getting cheaper compared to buses and trains but the government lacks courage to stand up to the motoring lobby
7971473 in britain many people work in low pay sectors and work long hours to improve their pay
7971474 on the move consumption is driven by a number of factors
7971475 poor infrastructure is a major cause if commuters can expect delays and cancellations on their journey they will try and minimise its effect on their day by using the time to eat their breakfast grab a coffee or apply last minute make up
7971476 nutritionally speaking you need to be relaxed to eat it helps digestion says dr nefertiti sourial director of the institute of optimum nutrition
7971477 in london few if any good hotels offer a double room at under 150
7971478 many people here simply do not take the cold seriously and appreciate the danger it poses
7971479 this research highlights once again the scandal of excess winter deaths in britain these are not primarily due to flu they are a consequence of cold weather and to
7971480 the problem is worse in britain than in almost any other european country we can describe britons as the fat people of europe
7971481 it is time the rail industry ended the 40 year christmas freeze and helped get people out of their cars by running trains on boxing day at the very least
7971482 the uks output per worker performance has long lagged behind that of its competitors by this measure us productivity is 45 per cent higher and productivity in france and germany 19 and 71 per cent higher respectively than in the uk
7971483 the british stand out as having the greatest tendency to take other peoples partners
7971484 it is vital that breaches are investigated and companies need to implement strict response procedures to ensure this occurs
7971485 the harsh reality is that british motorists today are not only reluctant to stop and offer assistance themselves but are also unwilling to accept help from others
7971486 you are a modern country one of the leading countries in the world and you place your citizens in a situation where they dont receive the healthcare they need in the 21st century this is intolerable
7971487 i realise one thing here that is really bad the young generation doesnt respect the old people
7971488 save businesses and individuals time and money through reform of the workplace dispute resolution framework
7971489 stronger enforcement of the national minimum wage and employment agency standards
7971490 the only area of employment law that the government can conceive of simplifying is that of dispute resolution
7971491 the governments arguments for increasing the penalty for non compliance with the national minimum wage hinge on the current lack of a significant punishment for the offending employer
7971492 i feel that it can only increase the perception that the government are in hock to the unions to an extraordinary degree
7971493 stronger enforcement of the national minimum wage must clearly be supported
7971494 we also support the provisions of clauses 14 to 16 on employment agencies
7971495 proposition that a golf club and a trade union should be treated in the same way is slightly bizarre given the special employment rights that have quite rightly been given to trade unions over the centuries which do not of course apply to golf clubs
7971496 at the heart of every part in the care system
7971497 much of the governments commendable ambition will not be achieved without a motivated and rewarded workforce
7971498 promote more stability in care placements a bigger place for the voice of the child more independent support for the child and i hope a better quality of care and more appropriate placements
7971499 it is important that they are given training in how to manage their own money or they will not feel the full benefit of it
7971500 reform the planning system to make it fairer more efficient and ready to equip britain for the challenges of the 21st century
7971501 under the bill there will be more accountability and a better place for the public to have a good substantial debate
7971502 bill will provide for a fairer and faster planning system one that delivers for the economy and the environment and that gives everyone a fair chance to have their say
7971503 take the best out of the bill and build on the strengths of the existing and familiar system
7971504 will reform the planning system to make britain better able to cope with the 21st century it will speed up decisions and accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy
7971505 a guaranteed basic standard of living for pensioners forms the platform of our side of the renewed contract between the state and the individual but we need to go further we will restore the link to earnings abandoned by a previous conservative government by 2012 by 2050 the basic state pension will be worth more than twice as much as it would otherwise that in addition to the reforms to the state second pension will ensure that people retiring in 2050 who have worked or cared for about 40 years will receive about 145 per week of state pension in todays earnings terms
7971506 to strengthen provision to support existing occupational schemes by simplifying the rules governing them through a rolling deregulatory review the decline in private sector occupational pension provision since the late 1960s is serious and in the face of increasing costs employers have been abandoning their defined benefit that is final salary schemes whose active membership numbers have fallen from 8 million in 1967 to 5 million in the 1980s and 1990s to fewer than 3 5 million today
7971507 the bill will introduce a mandatory duty on employers automatically to enrol their workers into a qualifying pension scheme many employers are already making substantial contributions to pension schemes and supporting their employees in saving for retirement to make the package of reforms successful however the government need all employers to play their part that is why all employers will be required to contribute to their workers pensions a minimum of 3 per cent on a band of earnings for defined contribution schemes as recommended by the pensions commission
7971508 a blueprint for a new understanding between individuals employers and the state which will give all workers the chance to take control of their own retirement providing for themselves and their dependants
7971509 there is broad consensus about the direction of these reforms but ministers have used that consensus as a shield from serious debate which is unacceptable and undermines the very concept of consensus
7971510 they have presided over the rapid decline of our pension system and let down many of our most vulnerable elderly people their past efforts at reform have failed abysmally the one man on the labour benches who appeared to have any idea how to tackle our pensions challenge had his ministerial career summarily terminated by the then prime minister probably because he is smarter than him i want these reforms to work and this bill to make a difference not just because they are right for the pensions of tomorrow and for all our futures but because we fully intend that a conservative government will implement these reforms in four years time
7971511 a general welcome to some of the proposals in the bill on the personal account scheme
7971512 in addition to the potential problems for personal accounts the means testing strategy has wider problems many people do not claim means tested benefits because of their complexity for example more than 1 5 million pensioners eligible for pension credit do not claim it in recent years council tax bills have gone up substantially but only 53 per cent of pensioners claim the council tax benefit to which they are entitled means testing also erodes the returns from saving and reduces incentives to save
7971513 there has been a lot of talk about consensus in the debate but in future and particularly in committee that consensus has to be based on proper debate and a proper resolution of the genuine concerns and worries about the bill and the personal accounts scheme however welcome well thought through and well constructed they are they have to benefit as large a section as possible of the target audience which is people who do not currently save that is why the arguments on means testing and advice are so important the minister will have to do better in his reply than the secretary of state did and will have to do better throughout committee to ensure that the issue is resolved so that we can ensure a scheme that can genuinely be recommended to everyone in the target audience

7971532 in this incident it appears that the young girl involved was with her parents in the kitchen area of the hostel preparing some food
7971533 while turning on the appliance to cook one of her parents seems accidentally to have turned on two gas rings instead of one which caused too much gas in the atmosphere for a normal ignition
7971534 the surplus gas then appears to have caused a minor flashover which caused the injuries to the young girl

7971566 changing the way in which we produce and use energy will have an important role to play in meeting targets that we have set ourselves we must ensure that we have the widest possible range of cleaner low carbon energy sources and technologies
7971567 the governments attempts to disguise their incoherence on renewables with targets set far ahead in a fantasy future are now unravelling
7971568 it contains very little on matters such as energy efficiency surely an energy bill should legitimately deal with that but where is it there should be so much more about energy conservation in the home for example where is all of that where is the serious material on microgeneration and distributed power
7971569 energy security is no longer simply a technical matter to do with supply but an increasingly important aspect of national security

7971835 you could not have any suspicion of a wrongdoing within any kind of element in the armed forces but particularly this one
7971836 will this be damaging i suspect not i think the fact they have kicked out these soldiers for suspected class a drugs will show to most people how seriously the army takes this
7971837 drug misuse in the armed forces will not be tolerated
7971838 positive rates in the army over the last three years average around 0 8 compared with over 7 in civilian workplace drug testing programmes in the uk
7971839 whipping up hatred is not a good basis for fair taxation what matters more than retrospective taxation is properly working competitive markets which is what the energy regulator ofgem is there to bring about
7971840 we are seeing old fashioned socialist hatred converting once again into high taxation
7971841 arbitrary unpredictable and it would undermine confidence and the climate for future investment
7971842 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
7971843 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
7971844 if it is true to say that we are our true self our christ centered self it is equally correct to say that we have a false self
7971845 it is the self which wants to exsist outside of the reach of gods will and gods love or outside of reality and outside of life such a self cannot help but be an illusion

7971862 hes an author that writes about things that could happen in a childs life but its a really spiced up version
7971863 he writes on their level and kids really enjoy him
7971864 when students are presented with an opportunity to meet a favorite author in an intimate forum such as a school visit they become motivated to read as many works by this author as possible
7971865 an increase in the amount of time students spend reading will always have a positive influence on test scores

7971880 i believe in showcasing the natural beauty of the stone and to let my design aesthetic frame the specimen in a simple and elegant way
7971881 labradorite is often referred to as the stone of new beginnings it builds strength and assists with lifes intense transitions

7971900 we are here today to make a decision on something that has been done in violation of laws of the state of missouri and our own wishes
7971901 in our city park we have two permanent structures placed or being place there without authorization
7971902 the question before us is can we allow a structure to be placed in the park without input from the city secondly can we allow it without any regulations as to its size its structure what its liability to city might be and how many others with uses exactly like it will be allowed and so forth
7971903 i take full responsibility for this i apologize it was a mistake
7971904 i felt it was going to be a good thing for the park
7971905 the question before us is the legality of it we owe that to the citizens of laurie as it stands we have no rules we have to go through a process
7971906 now im saying were going to have the aldermen okay it
7971907 the 10 or 12 others who want to build something between now and sept 12
7971908 then i would ask for a motion to allow the two structures in question to be allowed through the fair with the proviso that they may have to be removed by the board at a later date

7971910 so the rape victim wakes up on the gurney and says so where is that marvelous ape must be in the way you tell it mad dog
7971911 to be honest with you im ashamed for her to advocate policy that will lead to more murders of innocent people including police officers and really in my view what shes doing is just a slap in the face to what her husband did which is to uphold public safety and stand for the law
7971912 when the next police officer is gunned down or killed is it fair to blame you
7971913 because i am going to give you partial blame put that in your legacy for your husband

7971919 clearly denvers rarefied air has gone straight to democrat leaders heads for thinking that their new energy plan is anything more than a rehash of the broken promises and failed policies of the past
7971920 only house republicans are talking about meaningful energy solutions on the floor of the house of representatives and at gas stations kitchen tables and town hall meetings across america
7971921 clearly denvers rarefied air has gone straight to democrat leaders heads for thinking that their new energy plan is anything more than a rehash of the broken promises and failed policies of the past
7971922 here we are exactly 600 days removed from the beginning of this congress and only now are democrat leaders getting around to proposing a so called comprehensive plan for energy independence
7971923 moreover democrats have demonstrated their glaring lack of credibility on this issue in ironic fashion by proposing an energy plan in the very same city where for months they had been getting their gas tax free while coloradans were scrimping and saving to pay their fair share
7971924 only house republicans are offering the american people an all of the above energy policy that creates new american made energy unleashing the potential of new technologies and further fostering conservation efforts
7971925 only house republicans are talking about meaningful energy solutions on the floor of the house of representatives and at gas stations kitchen tables and town hall meetings across america this historic national conversation and call to action will continue as long as speaker pelosi and democrat leaders refuse to allow a vote on these widely supported reforms

7971936 senator joe biden may be one of the only u s politicians that can get iraqs feuding sunni shiite and kurdish politicians to agree but not in a good way
7971937 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics
7971938 this is the first ill vote for a republican president or work for one
7971939 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
7971940 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy
7971941 terrible 6 efficiency even an old 80c51 can do at least 3x
7971942 her challenge tonight is to come across as someone the american people can be comfortable with as first lady and everything that represents and by the way that is a very tough job
7971943 im sure that obama himself will say something about mccain but i would say the toughest language is going to come from others
7971944 michele obama said that she was never proud to be an american for years i have relied on this show to present factural news without negative slants correct this immediately or does this reflect the true feelings of the newhour
7971945 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for

7971950 i confess that i have for a long time envied the great painters who have come before me for their opportunities which i never thought i would ever encounter however i have now painted an emperor and at last a pope
7971951 i feel sorry for the cab driver i feel sorry for the lady
7971952 before i leave i have to peak out to make sure no one is near the door or by my window
7971953 after a certain time im not usually alone i go around with people
7971954 you just cant just walk around by yourself in this area anymore
7971955 there is no way on gods good earth that those children should have been placed in the care of a 23 year old boy to hike one of the most dangerous trails near one of the most dangerous waters in the united states which lead to the death of magdalena
7971956 thanks to many community groups who have worked with the parks department to bring back highbridge from decade of abandonment it is now buzzing with activity
7971957 today the future of highbrigde park shines even brighter and thats because its one of eight regional parks that are being revitalized as part of our planyc our bold agenda for a greener greater city
7971958 it was over 100 years ago a destination for tourists
7971959 bringing it back is going to be great for both communities its a good link for the bronx and manhattan
7971960 a lot of people use the floor to ceiling racks or the free standing racks something that kind of puts it right up against the wall
7971961 weve got ones that hold one bike ones that hold two bikes weve even got ones that hold four bikes
7971962 there is another option where you can mount it up on ceiling where its up out of the way its not taking up space on your wall its just taking up on the dead space above your head that you are not using
7971963 weve got hooks to mount them we even have a pulley system to bring the bikes up and down really easily
7971964 dont store it on its side just because typically if you lean it on its side where the gears are you are going to have a couple of problems when it comes time to ride it again things may be out of alignment and not shifting properly
7971965 dont store it next it a refrigerator or an air conditioner because any kind of rapid heat change the cycle of the heat changes can mess up the bike components and mess up the paint generally make sure your tires are aired up before it goes into storage it should hold up better that way
7971966 overall it will feel very even it will have an easier approach not so much glare
7971967 nowadays you catch a lot of glare we break it down and have good glare control
7971968 to give you an idea we can reduce energy consumption at each street lamp by about 25 to 30 percent immediately thats just one to one comparison
7971969 we also have the energy savings because of the control systems you can turn it on turn it off dim it down as the ambient lighting increases or decreases
7971970 if you ask the city theyre probably changing out some light somewhere every day that will go away
7971971 so now you have labor savings and the cost of fuel driving around finding all these broken lights that is a significant saving and i believe that is if not larger than the energy savings its equal to it
7971972 you have the high line an amazing old piece of industrial infrastructure being joined by a beautiful contemporary building by frank gehry or jean nouvel
7971973 at the time nobody was trying to preserve the structure
7971974 we thought it was a fantastic opportunity for new york city to create something amazing
7971975 you know its interesting the california decision as well as the massachusetts decision i dont think should ever have been implemented by the governors schwarzenegger and romney
7971976 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
7971977 you know its interesting that you decided to wear lip liner without wearing lipstick
7971978 you know its interesting that those two got married so quickly and then decided to have kids within a month
7971979 some may call you elitist over privileged preening with a snotty sense of entitlement i call you my hero
7971980 fun writing with a twist of the conservative disease but enjoyable all the same besides were suckers for a nice pair of legs
7971981 e m has a certain je ne sais quoi that evokes an admiration for her brilliance wonder at her beauty and laughter for her way of breaking it to you
7971982 i believe if e m were a superheroine her main power would be sarcasm
7971983 if pope benedict is conservative catholicisms posterchild e m is the pin up centerfold
7971984 considering all of the other right wing nutters out there the american princess is only mildly ridiculous
7971985 a well written very conservative blog with an author who offers no apologies for her beliefs
7971986 like the catholic eva longoria assuming eva longoria isnt catholic
7971987 e m proves that you can survive living in ann arbor
7971988 odi et amo but not in the way catullus meant it
7971989 that woman on americas most wanted only bore an amazing resemblence to e m some say it wasnt actually her
7971990 e m you are your own subculture i would like to be part of that subculture but i dont think its acceptable for me to wear that much pink
7971991 hey e m i thought you said this was a porn site
7971992 its probably more restricted in beijing than in other cities in the country
7971993 in general it is still very much a taboo topic you dont talk about it at work you dont talk about it with your family you only talk about it when the other person knows something about it already and you really trust them
7971994 i was growing up on my own most of the time
7971995 it is not that they didnt care it is that they just couldnt understand what i was up to
7971996 there is a degree of choice and freedom that does not exist here
7971997 i actually tried to have a girlfriend to please my parents
7971998 it was difficult in the sense that i didnt want it to get too far
7971999 i would like to see a more liberal media environment where people could comment on the subject and have a discussion
7972000 you see that in places like hong kong and thailand singapore is also closed but they have at least opened up discussion
7972001 things could change in china in the next 10 years but im not looking forward to the wait
7972002 this is a confucian society and these values are not going to go away
7972003 devant les joueurs waldemar kita a tenu saluer le travail de michel der zakarian et baptiste gentili notamment pour laccession en l1
7972004 ce nest pas la d faite bordeaux qui a pr cipit la chute de michel der zakarian mais un ensemble de chose depuis la reprise de lentra nement qui ont convaincu la direction
7972005 il y a une vraie r volution culturelle mener lid e est de mettre un entra neur qui ne soit pas issu du moule nantais toute la difficult est de ne pas tourner le dos son histoire et de se moderniser
7972006 in a facility like this the possibility for injury is enormous
7972007 its pretty standard to lose an eye lose a limb lose a life were going to have a government that makes sure workers arent put at unnecessary risk
7972008 she was good i could not have been more proud of her and she also looked cute which didnt hurt
7972009 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7972010 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7972011 help churches find ways to help christians get to the polls
7972012 our vision statement is an american society that affirms and practices judeo christian values rooted in biblical authority
7972013 america will be better off if people who are voting are seeking gods guidance
7972014 omg your black grades who cares i mean just to get into harvard and columbia you need to be much higher then the 45 even if your a super minority
7972015 we know the strategy because theyve already shown their cards ultimately i think the american people recognize that old stuff hasnt moved us forward that old stuff just divides us
7972016 you do know i grew up as an african american
7972017 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
7972018 wow michele is so cute she gave such a wonderful speech
7972019 however the man did serve his country and that takes character
7972020 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
7972021 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
7972022 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
7972023 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
7972024 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is

7972038 someone once told me that when you have a child it opens up parts of your heart that you never knew existed and it is so true
7972039 its like you have a child and you think everything that ive done up until this point is insignificant in comparison to being a father its a beautiful beautiful thing
7972040 i had a lot of practice growing up i was the oldest of the children in my family i had to do a lot of diaper changing and lunch making
7972041 i was taking my little sister to ballet picking up my brother sort of being a super nanny
7972042 working with babies on the set for so long it really started to bring out this desire to have a child
7972043 and it took a couple years after that to find the right person and to hopefully be mature enough to be a great father which is really all you want to do
7972044 maybe ana lucia busted l a based ghost hustler miles during her pre crash lapd days and now the freighter folkster is seeing visions of the late tailie on the island

7972048 its easy to say public safety is the sacred cow but really its safety thats a value just like perhaps education is a huge value
7972049 right now were not only in a lean budget time but people are having a hard time financially so for us to still put in that amenity is that a reflection of community values situations change and perhaps with the economic situation now the way it is the community may not like that we spend so much money on that facility
7972050 shout out to pitbull he helped us put it together
7972051 its the biggest record out right now and were making it rain

7972054 the other area you cant go without discussing with the county are the social programs and what the state is doing with both medicaid and welfare programs

7972059 our mission is to create and increase opportunities for corn growers
7972060 we get behind the cellulosic industry because that will help enhance the overall industry
7972061 and so were very supportive of whats going on in the cellulosic side of the ethanol industry whether it be switchgrass sweet sorghum alfalfa wood chips corn stalks corn cobs whatever were excited

7972069 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
7972070 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
7972071 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7972072 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
7972073 when a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors they buried the information and continued the illegal practice
7972074 we take issue with the states characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement
7972075 this agreement affirms our actions and we are continuing to make full refunds to all affected customers
7972076 we just finished getting rid of a guy named hussein in iraq and why are we trying to elect someone with the same name
7972077 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7972078 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7972079 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7972080 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7972081 generally expected to be weak during the remainder of 2008 before recovering modestly next year
7972082 seen as potentially exacerbating the contraction in the housing sector

7972096 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7972097 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7972098 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7972099 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7972100 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7972101 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7972102 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7972103 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7972104 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7972105 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient

7972107 homeowners whose monthly mortgage payments are resetting this year could face an increase of 411 at a time when they are already digesting a sharp rise in energy and food costs

7972112 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7972113 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7972114 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7972115 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7972116 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7972117 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7972118 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7972119 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7972120 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7972121 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7972122 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7972127 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7972128 the trend in e giving is a cultural move as fewer people of the younger generations carry cash
7972129 we live in a plastic online banking world where growing numbers of people prefer to exchange funds electronically rather than carry a checkbook or cash
7972130 back in 2000 just one third of protestant churches 34 percent had a church website
7972131 that exploded to 57 percent in 2005 and has inched upward since then to 62 percent
7972132 churches are exploring the theory that people who give electronically may tend to give more consistently because giving occurs even when the church member is not present at church on sunday
7972133 the most popular types of e giving are credit debit cards recurring electronic funds transfer from an established checking or savings account or private booths set up in the church foyer for members to give before or after the worship service
7972134 people are so used to doing everything online so it was a natural progression
7972135 people are more mobile now they travel more or are on the road working
7972136 the most important thing is the attitude of your heart whenever you give
7972137 online giving is just a different method of supporting the church through tithes and offerings
7972138 we wanted to offer online giving for people already using online banking and the internet for bookkeeping to make it easier for them
7972139 our only reservation was that for some people giving during the service is an act of worship those using automatic withdrawal can still participate in the offering time by placing an envelope in the offering plate that is marked that they contributed online
7972140 is that we do not charge setup or monthly service fees for our existing customers dealing with one vendor for offering envelope and e giving solutions simplifies the giving process for both the church member and church leader
7972141 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
7972142 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
7972143 has faced questions about his banks multi million dollar loans to michael gioranago a convicted bookmaker and prostitution ring promoter
7972144 is concerned by revelations that the bank owned by illinois democratic treasurer nominee alexi giannoulias family gave loans to a chicago crime figure and said the candidate owes him and the public a full accounting
7972145 newly discovered public records show broadway bank made 11 8 million in additional mortgage loans to giorango just last year giannoulias said he oversaw the servicing of those loans
7972146 giannoulias is so tainted by reputed mob links that several top illinois dems including the states speaker of the house and party chairman refused to endorse him even after he won the democratic nomination with obamas help
7972147 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
7972148 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
7972149 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7972150 it could turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7972151 these ministries to the youth children and women are important no doubt but we have to develop an intentional ministry to men
7972152 somewhere weve got to build bubba up its generally not happening in sunday school or missions
7972153 the men in our churches dont love each other dont know each other arent involved with each other
7972154 if we want to see mens ministry grow we have to connect with the men in our churches
7972155 there is a tremendous concern over the banking sector and a scramble right now for capital
7972156 the credit crunch is only now beginning because bank capital is so constricted by losses to date that they will have to begin shutting off credit to households and corporations and thats when we get the defaults
7972157 we have taken several actions to enhance liquidity such as reducing the dividend expense reductions and a reduction in our balance sheet growth
7972158 they want to escape the pressure of the funding markets
7972159 they wanted to borrow the money at the cheapest levels possible and floating rate notes helped them achieve that

7972183 the house at 12 marawa place aranda is significant is a well preserved example of late 1960s residential architecture the setting and the architecture combine to produce a building of integrity illustrative of modern architecture the house exhibits creative and artistic excellence in the late twentieth century regional style and is aesthetically significant for its freely composed simple shapes juxtaposed with fine detailing all expressed in the textural and tactile qualities of natural materials 12 marawa place aranda exhibits the principal characteristics of modern residential architecture in a national capital development commission radburn planned neighbourhood suburb with its appropriate human scale and functional domestic planning the house is also significant for its association with the housing of high level public servants in canberra as a design in the late twentieth century regional style of architecture the house is significant because it is the only example of boyds work in this style in canberra and is the last of a small number of residences designed by boyd in canberra one of australias important architects it is a good example of boyds work as identified by the raia robin boyd was recognised for his contribution to architecture awarded the order of the british empire commander civil in 1971 the raia gold medal in 1997 made a life fellow of the raia and an honorary fellow of the aia and listed as one of 200 in the people who made australia great in 1988 12 marawah place aranda has been acknowledged for many years as a distinctive example of architecture by professional bodies and has been included in boyds own publication about his work it continues to fulfil its original purpose and its planning remains innovative and sound
7972184 you want water where you from ah lubbly jubbly you buy water from me okay maybe later you please remember me
7972185 they couldnt admit to anything because they hadnt committed any
7972186 you know these people are brave to have their pictures put up here
7972187 they have normal lives now and yet theyre prepared to admit what they once were
7972188 please sit here for a moment while i tell you a bit about this terrible place
7972189 every prisoner from s 21 was brought here it was a one way journey for every one of them because they would be all killed they were all blindfolded and very thin they had spent maybe two months in interrogation maybe three hundred prisoners were killed each day usually as soon as they arrived the guards would normally kill them with a spade or a hatchet because bullets were too expensive
7972190 you may have noticed that cambodian people dont talk much about this atrocity but i promise you that they never forget every may cambodian families bring their children here to see what pol pot did they teach them so that this can never happen again
7972191 the prisoners were laid out side by side not allowed to speak not allowed to move and then one by one their skulls were bashed with tool music blasted out from loudspeakers to muffle the wails and when they were dead they were thrown into mass graves i will show you these now please come
7972192 he wanted to get rid of anyone with education so that he could start from year zero in his mind farmers would take over the land providing everything the country needed intellectuals were a barrier to his plan they had to be re educated this of course meant being killed for khmer rouge they were not killing innocent people they were only re educating them
7972193 khmer rouge used them as guards in s 21 the children knew no difference only what they wanted them to believe you cant really blame them but even the guards were not safe from his regime look
7972194 their heads were cut off to make sure they were really dead pol pot didnt want them to take revenge but it wasnt just the soldiers who were killed their wives and children were slaughtered so that no memory could ever remain
7972195 the guards told the prisoners to lie down with their eyes shut then the shackles could go around their ankles an iron bar was pushed through these holes to hold the shackles in place
7972196 as you would expect some prisoners had bigger feet than others but this did not matter to guards they would bang the metal rod breaking ankle bones so it went through to the next shackle
7972197 but god knows how he can see under there itll be like feeling about in the dark
7972198 were probably his first paying passengers for months and this boat is their home theyre his neighbours look even if it doesnt start we should still give them a few dollars i feel so sorry for them
7972199 its very disappointing that someone who is a public official wold be so cavalier about using county resources to benefit his campaign
7972200 if he is willing to place an official business for northampton county sign in his window to get out of paying 6 to park what else is he willing to use county resources to aid his campaign
7972201 all i can is i put all my quarters i had in the meter
7972202 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
7972203 the mcclune house 1969 near frankston has a big parasol roof of steel and fibreglass sheeting in the shape of a square doughnut supported on steel braced timber posts independent of the structure of the rooms these follow a comparatively free plan beneath a raised roof avoiding the central open square where a garden court receives the rain the rooms are conventionally framed as flat roofed boxes lined externally and internally with off saw pressure treated pine boards stained grey
7972204 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project

7972207 we have been running to the forest now and then we are terribly scared to remain inside the convent and be burnt alive so we thought the forest would be a better option
7972208 its raining and we had to take shelter in the school it is better to die together
7972209 we are too scared to even go to the convent and cook
7972210 the sooner christians return to the hindu fold the better it would be for the country
7972211 nobody had any complaints we didnt even have catechism classes for the students weve done no harm i dont know why we have to suffer like this i feel theres no one to help me now
7972212 a mob of about 70 80 people came with tyres kerosene petrol and axes many of them were drunk they flung burning tyres into our prayer room and even injured the cops who tried to resist
7972213 we long to be let out of this place and at least breath free
7972214 christians here are not equipped to kill such a prominent leader
7972215 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7972216 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7972217 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7972218 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7972219 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7972220 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
7972221 we are assisting paramedics and helping with provision of relief supplies we will go on increasing the rescue scale as far as we can
7972222 we do not know what will be the discharge tomorrow so the situation continues to be alarming an additional 500 country boats have been deployed
7972223 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7972224 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollar s dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
7972225 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars
7972226 the illicit drug market remains the largest criminal market in terms of extent scope and the degree of involvement by the majority of organized crime groups
7972227 if the inflation fails to ease in coming weeks the rbi will have no choice but to further tighten monetary policy

7972284 a fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
7972285 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
7972286 in the majority of cases a consideration of fair use prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owners ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements
7972287 the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice
7972288 it may be that the fair use of copyrighted music and copyrighted digital images will split
7972289 cases that look at examples of digital images supported by music will focus on the image

7972292 there are reports that four to five people have been killed in fresh violence the deaths are from yesterdays violence there is no fresh violence we have also clamped a curfew in kandhamal district to avoid any violence
7972293 saying naxals are behind the attack is totally misleading and orchestrated this is an attack by the agents of christian missionaries whose attempts at forcible conversions the swamiji countered
7972294 they tried and failed for seven times the eighth time they have succeeded a week before he was killed he had received an anonymous threat that said he would soon be killed though he lodged a formal complaint the officials did not do anything about it
7972295 the administration failed to ensure that the churches and christian institutions were attacked in return so this might be an act of revenge for that given the fact that lakshmanananda was actively combating forcible conversions in the region
7972296 they were very quick to do it probably because they wanted to ensure that communal violence does not break out but eventually they werent able to do that also
7972297 there is nothing that suggests that maosits may be involved though it is soon to say for sure they are not involved there have not been many incidents where they have attacked civilians even in such a case they would have killed the two home guards who were said to have been on duty at the time of attack

7972360 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7972361 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

7972364 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7972365 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7972366 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7972367 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7972368 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7972369 tonight when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency
7972370 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7972371 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7972372 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7972373 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7972374 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7972375 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7972376 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7972377 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7972378 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7972379 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7972380 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7972381 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7972382 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7972383 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7972384 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7972385 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7972386 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7972387 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7972388 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7972389 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7972390 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7972391 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7972392 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7972393 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

7972395 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7972396 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7972397 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7972398 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7972399 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7972400 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7972401 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7972402 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7972403 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7972404 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7972405 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7972406 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7972407 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7972408 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
7972409 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information about the situation they are in
7972410 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
7972411 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
7972412 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7972413 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7972414 a lot of this is coming to completion after a good deal of work and i look forward to go to libya
7972415 respected citizens of russia you undoubtedly know of the tragedy of south ossetia
7972416 i have signed decrees on the recognition of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia by the russian federation
7972417 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
7972418 in violation of the un charter its commitments under international agreements and in defiance of common sense the georgian leadership began an armed conflict
7972419 the same plight was in store for abkhazia tbilisi had obviously planned a blitzkrieg that would have presented the world with a fait accompli
7972420 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7972421 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7972422 taking into consideration the free expression of the will of the ossetian and abkhaz people guided by the provisions of the un charter by the 1970 declaration on principles of international law concerning friendly relations and cooperation among states the 1975 helsinki final act of the conference on security and cooperation in europe and other basic international documents i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7972423 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7972424 everything we went through now we are getting our reward
7972425 i am deeply concerned by todays august 25 appeal to president medvedev by russias federation council and duma the upper and lower houses of russias parliament to recognize the georgian regions of abkhazia and south ossetia as independent countries
7972426 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7972427 this is something that president bush has spoken on and he called on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not to recognize these separatist regions the united states the eu nato all see great importance in recognizing georgias territorial integrity
7972428 this contradicts principles of territorial integrity as a fundamental right
7972429 violates fundamental osce principles russia should follow osce principles by respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
7972430 the actions of russian troops in the conflict zone are directed at the unconditional fulfillment of the obligations that were made and thats why the excessive level of activity of nato naval forces in the black sea that continues to increase its groupings in the area is a cause for bewilderment
7972431 personnel armaments and military gear aboard and to transport them to russia
7972432 this is our tragic geopolitical fate but this is not 1921 they could not invade tbilisi they could not subjugate all georgia and nobody could make legal the annexation of our territory
7972433 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
7972434 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient russia will have to somehow learn how to play by internationally recognized rules they cannot go unpunished
7972435 they dont have any right to do so they might attempt it testing the patience of the georgian government as well as the western allies
7972436 they will try to go as far as they are allowed i dont think its implementable but they might say something like that they might demand such stupid action
7972437 they want to strangle the georgian economy to make the georgian people as unhappy as possible in order for them to turn against their own government
7972438 its basically a subversion plan carried out by russian government against sovereign georgia
7972439 airdrop capability is indicative of the asymmetric advantages of airpower throughout the u s central commands area of responsibility
7972440 our u s air force and coalition air forces capability to airdrop supplies to our ground forces in isolated environments allows the collective forces to maintain the pressure on the enemy in many places in afghanistan our airdrops are the sole source of resupply to ground forces
7972441 the ability to provide this resupply in both routine and emergency situations is very rewarding for our aircrews and the joint service support crews that prepare the airdrop cargo from rigging the bundles to loading the aircraft
7972442 this particular airdrop milestone marks the greatest amount of combat resupply in a single year since hostilities began in 2001
7972443 our ability to airdrop supplies and equipment from our and allows us to continually take the fight to enemy ground forces because friendly forces get the supplies they need when they need them
7972444 the airdrop mission has been focused in afghanistan because the lack of infrastructure there has made it difficult to resupply overland
7972445 as coalition forces have increased their presence at forward operating bases throughout afghanistan the demand for combat airdrop resupply has increased as well
7972446 it has to be frustrating for an enemy to know that we can choose the time and place that we resupply our forces on the ground
7972447 particularly when the enemy must receive their supplies from overland sources in some of the most inaccessible real estate on the planet
7972448 laders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident an official at the guangxi work safety bureau said
7972449 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7972450 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7972451 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7972452 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7972453 india is looking for acceptable nsg exemption clean exemption with no additional conditions and the parameters have to be within the parameters of july 18 2005 understanding with the us
7972454 civil nuclear cooperation is important but that does not mean at any cost
7972455 civil nuclear cooperation is important and they may push india but india does not get pushed
7972456 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
7972457 convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others
7972458 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7972459 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7972460 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7972461 this sends the wrong message to other perpetrators of violent crimes against women that they will not be held accountable for their actions
7972462 while there appears to be conflicting reports on the circumstances of the release of these prisoners whatever the circumstances this is clearly an injustice against the victim the victims family and all afghan women
7972463 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
7972464 the government of japan is seriously concerned with the slowdown of the denuclearization process on the korean peninsula
7972465 japan will continue applying pressure on north korea in order to complete the dismantlement of the yongbyon facility in close cooperation with all participants in the six party talks
7972466 for the first time in decades the pay equity gap grew wider after many women were forced onto individual contracts that stripped their pay to the barest levels in many cases illegally underpaying them and removing job security
7972467 the war against terrorism is elsewhere and thats where the war should go
7972468 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan
7972469 specific number hasnt been set yet but a battery of this size should be a little over a hundred people adding in the rest of the complement responsible for security and maintenance and things of that nature would add people i dont have a specific number for you on that
7972470 the united states is prepared and we commit in this document to deployment of a u s army patriot battery in poland well begin those deployments once of course we reach the necessary agreements with the poles and that could begin next year and then we set the goal of establishing a garrison for the u s army patriot battery in poland by the year of 2012
7972471 its still a matter for the secretary of defense to determine exactly how hed like to do that but for example the united states maintains a battery in germany we have some in other parts of the world
7972472 above all else we want a candidate with a relentless passion to succeed whatever the adversity
7972473 the type of person we will be looking for is someone whose cup is always half full never half empty someone who can laugh at themselves a strong team player who sees this as a lifetime opportunity and can tell a good joke to keep others spirits up
7972474 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsor of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear program
7972475 thats not a new demand that a longstanding demand its not just a us demand its a demand by the other five members of the six party talks
7972476 measures are being taken with assistance from nato experts to create facilities for airspace control and to restore airfields
7972477 increased activity of natos naval forces in the black sea
7972478 the russian black sea fleet continues providing security in the waters of the black sea near the shore of abkhazia
7972479 its an effort by the russians to try to halt the expansion of western influence into the former soviet space particularly the expansion of nato
7972480 its very important that this spiral of action and reaction not be allowed to get out of hand
7972481 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7972482 supply side risk does stem in the near term from possible disruption to production in the gulf of mexico
7972483 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7972484 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7972485 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7972486 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7972487 as the alliances leadership has ignored the important peacekeeping role of russia in the caucasus and south ossetia we believe it is expedient to suspend all peacekeeping operations between russia and nato for at least six months
7972488 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
7972489 for the time being we can see no necessity and possibility of sending russias chief military representative to brussels
7972490 i see no possibility for maintaining the project it will be suspended
7972491 we believe that visits by high level representatives of nato military leaders to the russian federation should be postponed in addition we intend to suspend the practice of visits to russian ports by nato warships permanent military formations as well as suspend participation of russian troops and forces in joint exercises
7972492 we are working from the position that the situation in afghanistan is a common problem the taliban have been extremely active of late
7972493 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7972494 voters are indifferent to events abroad during u s elections
7972495 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
7972496 until recently we tried to help restore state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
7972497 the forces will remain in its place until they enter the camp to collect the stockpiled weapons and prevent more rebels from getting inside the camp
7972498 arrival of large quantities of weapons into the camp with the aim of staging subversive acts and attacks against the government forces
7972499 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7972500 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7972501 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7972502 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7972503 the report was regrettably seen in some quarters as big business yet again being negative and failing to assist australia to address the challenge of climate change
7972504 just in case you think i am advocating a free ride for industry let me make it clear that there is nothing in the bca submission that suggests that industry should not share some of the costs associated with the introduction of emissions trading
7972505 will likely smooth the short term dislocations of industry restructuring
7972506 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7972507 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7972508 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7972509 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7972510 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7972511 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7972512 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7972513 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7972514 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7972515 my dad was hard core as was his dad and his granddad thats the way our family does it
7972516 when i realized that the game might still be going on i figured you were going to cancel
7972517 ive got to get things into better order and stop indulging my every whim that includes not blowing off anything and everything for the yankees
7972518 what of course not thats no longer a priority in fact when i left the house the game was just going into extra innings and im completely okay with it
7972519 even if the game was still on after our session ended im going to dinner with a friend so i wont know the score until tonight
7972520 level with me you want to know the score of the game dont you
7972521 well either one of us could simply punch a few keys on our phones and have that score or i could go over to the computer and look it up
7972522 but given that you want to work on better impulse control why dont we start practicing that right now and put the game on the back burner until the session is over
7972523 i dont think anyone could like them as much as you but yes im definitely a fan
7972524 i do very much so but the reality is that im working right now as are you on a particular psychological issue and i therefore sacrifices must be made
7972525 its interesting how not doing anything can be of benefit
7972526 i do but i can wait until i get outside
7972527 its reasonable to assume that the current defendants will come to a similar conclusion
7972528 direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
7972529 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up
7972530 the elections are now behind us now is the time for us to put zimbabwe first
7972531 food is their latest weapon in their regime change agenda
7972532 to a praiseworthy search for peace and greater amity for our nation
7972533 happily all political parties in the country have acknowledged culpability in this violence
7972534 for the avoidance of doubt the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the on going dialogue
7972535 we will not attend we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7972536 over time we will be removing color copiers and printers from the locations where they are not essential
7972537 managing our expenses is not only a critical aspect of our strategy it is also an important part of our jobs each of us must do our part to manage our expenses by challenging every dollar we spend
7972538 they are cyclical businesses that do get a bit fat in the good days
7972539 its not material but a worthwhile exercise for a company the size of citigroup
7972540 we have spent considerable time looking at our head count and related expense and while we have made progress in that area we still have more work to do
7972541 avril lavigne ok sebenarnya tidak ada elemen yang tidak baik personalitinya lebih baik

7972544 its not uncommon to seize computer hard drives containing hundreds of thousands of images and videos
7972545 the long term psycho emotional repercussions of viewing the violent sexual nature of this material can negatively impact members personal family and professional lives
7972546 their rights to reintegration should be respected and it should of course be fully supported
7972547 we are concerned of course that the longer the minors remain away from their families away from their communities the more difficult the reintegration process is likely to be
7972548 the prime minister has responsibility as head of government to rescue them minors and help them for their reintegration to their respective family
7972549 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7972550 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7972551 inconsistent with unanimously approved united nations security resolutions that russia has consistently voted for in the past
7972552 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7972553 im here to do whatever i can to bring peace and justice to our country
7972554 who knows maybe that will be what makes a difference
7972555 im here to do whatever i can to bring peace and justice to our country
7972556 who knows maybe that will be what makes a difference
7972557 weve already received thousands of enquiries about the f1 to 20 series and while we have sold a few of these at our auctions this is the first time the whole range of over 200 000 numbers will be available to purchase
7972558 the upshot of less traffic is a drop in congestion levels meaning motorists can get from a to b quicker while travelling at lower and more economical speeds
7972559 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7972560 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7972561 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7972562 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

7972575 sam gets to hide behind the camera i cant but i think hes planning on factoring that in
7972576 as like a major factor itd be a major liability you know ash runs out of breath or his back goes out and stuff like that i mean i just blew my hamstring fighting a stunt guy for burn notice the show that im doing now so theres a little bit of truth to all of that
7972577 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
7972578 the beauty of the evil dead movies is that youre only appealing to one demographic and thats people who like horror movies and you just have to please them you dont have to appeal to the studio youre already pleasing them by giving them part 4
7972579 i mean if we were really smart though wed go back to a handheld movie and shoot it in 16mm and find someplace in the middle of nowhere and have a crew of 10 people if we were smart
7972580 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7972581 there is a significant amount of excitement and enthusiasm and anticipation
7972582 i think when senator clinton and senator obama and their respective aides figure all of the process out im sure all of us will ultimately be supporting senator obama to be the democratic nominee i think there is an attempt to try figure out all of those particulars
7972583 in 50 years of interviews jerry siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery
7972584 your father dies in a robbery and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the worlds greatest hero im sorry but theres a story there
7972585 america did not get superman from our greatest legends but because a boy lost his father
7972586 superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability
7972587 supermans invulnerability to bullets loss of family destruction of his homeland all seem to overlap with jerrys personal experience theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for superman
7972588 i believe i have the first accurate account jerrys father wasnt shot and robbed he had a heart attack during a robbery
7972589 had no pensions no contracts no health benefits and companies didnt even pay for the artists supplies when these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves they were either collectively cast out or made false promises
7972590 having their names listed as supermans creators was the biggest victory of all
7972591 kurt vonnegut jules pfeiffer will eisner eli wallach and his wife were there
7972592 walter cronkite came on and they showed superman flying and he described what had happened at the end he said another triumph for truth justice and the american way

7972613 the first time i went to australia was in 1991 and the last time in 2008 i have toured australia a lot and do have some connection with the people there they have been watching me for a long time and they respect the sport something that i truly treasure and value it has been great playing in front of the australian crowds they understand the game and also value different sessions of test cricket they respect me as a player and i respect them as spectators

7972649 i am hillary clinton and i did not approve that message
7972650 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7972651 my vote is a protest vote i live in ohio i know our votes count in a very special way because whoever wins ohio is often the person who becomes the president of the united states and i do not want to reward the democratic party with my vote i am disgusted with them
7972652 she can do it but that doesnt mean we have to do it

7972654 the deal would allow some states to cast votes for both obama and clinton before ending the roll call in acclamation for the illinois senator clinton herself may cut off the vote and recommend unanimous nomination of obama according to democratic officials involved in the negotiations
7972655 whether or not there will be a roll call and if so under what conditions is entirely up to the obama campaign and they have not yet decided what the roll call is going to look like

7972709 gaza is on the threshold of becoming the first territory to be intentionally reduced to a state of abject destitution with the knowledge acquiescence and some would say encouragement of the international community
7972710 its like a meeting with a dietitian we need to make the palestinians lose weight but not to starve to death
7972711 became a moving target because of defendants belated production of evidence that it had previously stated was either nonexistent or destroyed
7972712 indeed no written policy exists even today nor was there any evidence other than oral testimony of what employees were told with respect to preservation of documents relevant to this case the lack of a written document retention and litigation hold policy and procedures for its implementation including timely reminders or even a single e mail notice to relevant employees exemplifies defendants lackadaisical attitude with respect to discovery of these important documents
7972713 the harm caused by the lack of a preservation policy was compounded by an egregious failure to diligently search for responsive documents in alternate locations until well after the eleventh hour in the wake of the initial hearing on the motion for sanctions for spoliation
7972714 although the extent of that destruction was not as extensive as was once thought due to defendants very belated production of responsive documents from alternative sources that it only recently bothered to identify and search
7972715 the ignorance of the technical personnel of the importance of the old source code to defendants preservation obligation is not of course a legitimate excuse defendants had a duty to notify and periodically remind technical personnel of defendants preservation obligation and ensure that they took adequate steps to safeguard the data at a minimum defendants were reckless in their conduct regarding the development computer had defendants imposed a proper litigation hold in this case the evidence on the development computer in particular the log of changes to the websites source code would have been preserved instead evidence of prior versions of source code was destroyed
7972716 did not give the court confidence that all source code has been produced to the contrary the court is left with the impression that defendants are not exactly sure how to interpret their own source code system and that the true dates have not been discovered
7972717 the court is frankly shocked that when searching for source code to be produced pursuant to an unambiguous court order issued in december 2006 defendants apparently waited until april 2008 to consult with the person who was responsible for pouring over the files from the development computer to the new source code control system to determine whether she had responsive electronically stored information defendants do not dispute that the archive cd was responsive and they have provided no adequate explanation and the court can fathom none for why the cd was not found and produced earlier apparently neither normal discovery obligations that apply even in the absence of a court order nor even a court order nor a pending motion for sanctions for spoliation were sufficient to get defendants attention instead only the very slowly dawning realization that serious sanctions would be imposed finally resulted in a key it employee searching a readily accessible office drawer for the archive cd containing source code

7972731 we have never neglected our core gamers we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years
7972732 these games are not ready to launch in early 2009 but are being worked on by all development teams
7972733 if there is any perception that nintendo is ignoring the core gamers its a misunderstanding and we really want to get rid of that misunderstanding by any means
7972734 now we turn to the community with an even bigger question which image do you want to see on your resistance 2 collectors edition cover while you may think developing the game is our biggest challenge at insomniac we agonize almost equally over important details like creating and choosing the box art and this time weve got three solid images that are making the decision especially difficult were torn and want to know what you think so vote well be eagerly awaiting your feedback as always
7972735 its going really well there are several hours of fairly polished game to play were actively testing parts of the game and getting feedback from play testers and things are coming together

7972753 he has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son
7972754 and you who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh god made alive together with him having forgiven us all our trespasses by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands this he set aside nailing it to the cross he disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame by triumphing over them in him
7972755 little children you are from god and have overcome them for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world
7972756 in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us for i am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord
7972757 whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil for the devil has been sinning from the beginning the reason the son of god appeared was to destroy the works of the devil
7972758 since therefore the children share in flesh and blood he himself likewise partook of the same things that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death that is the devil and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery
7972759 but you o lord are a shield about me my glory and the lifter of my head

7972902 sales have dropped significantly and the number of indisposed properties increases drastically in the past three months the drop is of 30 40 for the external market and 5 for the domestic while forecasts say that it will continue until the end of the year early 2009
7972903 comparatively paphos had the highest prices today property prices show a drastic decrease of up to 30 or even 50 for flats
7972904 the future of the property market is gloomy due to the slowdown in the number of sales across cyprus the commercial plots and land are exempted since the demand by foreign investors russians mostly who want to expand their business activities to the island is big
7972905 the interest rate increase which pushes monthly installments up is the main reason for the drop in domestic demand which will continue in the next few months
7972906 if the crisis goes on lending will become more difficult for other professional groups too such as hoteliers and traders

7972908 we have been working on this for a number of years and we are happy we have gotten to the process where we are working closely with the county and clarian arnett to make sure that ambulance services in the future are the best it can be i know we have a lot of relieved employees that work for teas
7972909 we have gone from 4 ambulances on the road to 5 and now hopefully in september we will be able to get the 6th ambulance on the road with the goal that the ambulance service is able to respond to the 911 calls as quickly as possible

7972940 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7972941 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7972942 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7972943 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7972944 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7972945 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7972946 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7972947 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7972948 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient

7972951 wed been using the sony hvr z1us since jon and i filmed baghdad er in 2005 and loved them
7972952 they looked great they were better than anything else we had used up to that point we had looked at the p2s and thought about going tapeless when they came out in the end back then we didnt like the feel of the camera were intimidated by the solid state media and passed sticking with what we liked in the z1 but jon and sony really pushed to switch over to the ex1s
7972953 we started shooting with the ex1 halfway through a project we were doing on high school basketball
7972954 we were supposed to start the project with that camera as basically an early sony field test but the cameras didnt come over from japan soon enough and so we actually shot half the project with the z1u and then we switched over to the tapeless camera
7972955 i flipped on nine decibels of gain when we went outside and still thinking that it was going to look mediocre when looking in the monitor on the camera
7972956 we loaded it into the system on an hd have thought i was shooting it in daylight it looks fantastic all the detail in very mediocre yellow outdoor light instead is transformed into a beautiful better that your naked eye point of view
7972957 we dont have an audio person with us its a one man band and youre responsible for the reporting the cinematography the how we do it
7972958 whats really useful about it is you see it in more or less hd quality that night
7972959 usually when we go out on trips were often just a small team in the middle of nowhere we dont have anything to review our footage on or even talk about it in this case you have the files that night jon and i can critique each others footage then go out into the field the next day and improve upon it
7972960 actually when we leave the hotel in the morning were carrying probably six flash memory cards each so we have six hours worth of recording capability
7972961 initially we took the laptop with us in the back of the car because we thought that maybe we were going to have to camp out and in the evenings we would clean our cards but it turns out that we never had a day in which we recorded more than six hours each wed return to the hotel clean off the cards and start fresh the next day the interesting thing that really makes it advantageous for our work is that basically you can carry everything you need with you in your shirt pocket and in your pants pocket

7973051 theres really no way that fox providing the pool coverage could affect how the convention is covered
7973052 tonight claire mccaskill will address the very liberal delegates of the democrat national convention she will no doubt fail at achieving the impossible convincing missourians and americans that the obama biden ticket understands their needs and the challenges our country faces
7973053 it is no wonder claire asserted that the low performance of the vacationing democrat controlled congress it is not as bad as it seems shes more worried about taking her kids to see kanye west 1 than addressing issues that impact americans lives claire and kanye have a great deal in common kanye claimed that george bush doesnt care about black people and claire thinks george bush let people die on rooftops in new orleans because they were poor and because they were black disappointing ridiculous and hurtful rhetoric that divides rather than brings people together
7973054 based on the missouri democrat delegation being seated in the nose bleed section at the democrat national convention it does not appear as if anything has changed missouri is not a priority for democrats
7973055 obamas elitist attitude toward middle america and his disregard for missouri was reinforced when he decided to use a missouri family as a prop during his wifes convention speech only to forget where he was first he was in kansas city then st louis then back to kansas city obama continues to prove that he is nothing more than glitz and glamour basking in the light of his own celebrity and hoping that no one looks at the facts of his record

7973281 when there are lots of competing males trying to fertilise the eggs of females males produce larger more competitive sperm that live for longer
7973282 similarly when females detect that there are too many males competing for her eggs too many sperm can kill the eggs of some organisms the females play hard to get producing smaller eggs that are harder for searching sperm to find
7973283 these changes make sense if youre stuck to a rock like sea squirts are
7973284 if you cant run away from a highly competitive environment you must therefore make your gametes more competitive in order to get a higher chance of successfully reproducing
7973285 we manipulated adult densities in the field by placing either one low density or 15 high density sea squirts in a cage for one month
7973286 this research tells us a little as to how sex evolved in the first place
7973287 specifically it gives us some insight into why sperm are so tiny and males make millions of them whereas female eggs are much larger and are produced in fewer numbers
7973288 because these organisms reproduce by the ancestral mode of reproduction it gives us an indication as to how competition between males led to all sorts of reproductive strategies including the one used by humans internal fertilisation

7973335 if we want to look at the big picture and plan for the future we need the certainty that a recurring referendum provides
7973336 without the referendum the preliminary areas identified by superintendent nerad and his staff for further cuts would create unwarranted stresses on our students making it much harder to provide the education they deserve

7973360 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
7973361 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
7973362 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
7973363 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
7973364 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers

7973846 the proper way to take in minerals is through mineral rich water through nutrient dense foods and beverages through mineral rich bone broths in which all of the macrominerals sodium chloride calcium magnesium phosphorus potassium and sulphur are available in ready to use ionized form as a true electrolyte solution through the use of unrefined sea salt and by adding small amounts of fine clay or mud as a supplement to water or food a practice found in many traditional societies throughout the world analysis of clays from africa sardinia and california reveals that clay can provide a variety of macro and trace minerals including calcium phosphorus magnesium iron and zinc clay also contains aluminium but silicon present in large amounts in all clays prevents absorption of this toxic metal and actually helps the body eliminate aluminium that is bound in the tissues when mixed with water clay forms a temporary colloidal system in which fine particles are dispersed throughout the water eventually the particles settle to the bottom of the container but a variety of mineral ions will remain in the water these mineral ions are available for absorption while other minerals that form an integral part of the clay particles may in some circumstances be available for absorption through ionic exchange at the point of contact with the intestinal villi clay particles defined as having a size less than 1 2 microns have a very large surface area relative to their size they carry a negative electric charge and can attract positively charged pathogenic organisms along with their toxins and carry them out of the body thus clay compounds not only provide minerals but also can be used as detoxifying agents as such they facilitate assimilation and can help prevent intestinal complaints such as food poisoning and diarrhea they also will bind with antinutrients found in plant foods such as bitter tannins and prevent their absorption

7974337 jn 3 5 6 emphasis mine it is clear from these two scriptures that the new birth is entirely spiritual and has no physical element to it to say that we enter into an unbreakable blood relationship with god is to contradict the testimony of his word
7974338 see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
7974339 those who are led by the spirit of god are sons of god
7974340 our freedom in christ is one of the most precious gifts we have received from god you no longer have to walk according to the flesh as you did before you received christ you are not even forced to walk according to the spirit you can choose to walk according to the sprit or to walk according to the flesh pg 89 emphasis mine
7974341 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows the one who sows to please the sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life
7974342 little children make sure no one deceives you the one who practices righteousness is righteous just as he is righteous the one who practices sin is of the devil for the devil has sinned from the beginning this is how we know who the children of god are and who the children of the devil are anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of god nor is anyone who does not love his brother
7974343 if you hold onto a secret lustful thought or proud attitude without hurting anyone else you need only confess it to god the only relationship affected is the one between you and him page 92 emphasis mine
7974344 when you step off the path of the spirit confess your sin to god and anyone you may have offended receive forgiveness and return to walking the right path pp 91 92 emphasis added
7974345 he has cancelled the debt of your sins past present and future pg 107 emphasis mine

7974353 the names rioghnan my fair lady but you can just call me rio
7974354 why dont i just call you the guy who died at my hand
7974355 oh my lady that is far too morbid for someone cheerful and lovable such as i
7974356 morbid is when you see your comrades bodies strewn across the floor
7974357 morbid is when you see the dark hordes marching upon you and you cannot run away
7974358 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

7974361 como una tremenda ayuda para los estudiantes pero especialmente para aquellos padres que al ser consultados por sus hijos por sus amistades o por la misma escuela no tienen m s que decir que lo que reza la araucana
7974362 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
7974363 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7974364 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
7974365 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
7974366 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido

7974369 some men see things as they are and say why i dream things that never were and say why not
7974370 if anybody is making that kind of a characterization theyre stupid and its wrong
7974371 a magazine runs a cover with an unflattering portrait of senator obama or some right wing goofball writes a largely libelous book with a lot of lies about obama you dont see the mccain camp jumping in to comment

7974378 porque a felicidade n o tem nada nada absolutamente nada a ver com o que voc tem mas com o que voc quer
7974379 the applicant provided a study based on vehicles per hour in the peak hour and we had analyzed it based on vehicles per day
7974380 the applicant also confirmed that there was a total of six staff members at the facility and that meant that parking could be provided both on and off street
7974381 the facts that support the planning departments opinions and conclusions about the traffic impact have been horribly distorted not just today but the last time we were here as well
7974382 what hasnt been done here is that you havent analyzed the intersection youve just used these numbers to say four seasons is going from 30 trips during peak hour to 50 trips
7974383 for me the worst case is if all the children do arrive in that hour and theyre all in individual cars right now youve got 40 trips in and 40 trips out if you increase it to 64 then youre going to jump 100 trips every day
7974384 in addition to the level of traffic coming and going throughout the day we must endure the constant battle for on street parking frequent lack of mail delivery as a result of blocked mailboxes increased noise and what i call an us versus them mentality
7974385 it seems from the previous meetings that a small number of people in the community are keeping a large number of the rest of the people from having access to this affordable child care
7974386 at every time that i have taken my son in and out i have never incurred a problem
7974387 every day i receive on average five to seven calls for parents looking for quality affordable child care
7974388 there are simply not enough quality affordable centers in our area this is a problem because if a parent does not have child care they cannot go to work
7974389 several of the people who do live on lakeview drive have two and three vehicles they also each have a driveway i have seen them deliberately park their cars on the street even in front of our daycare center in an attempt to not allow us to park our cars
7974390 this neighborhood was done what in the early 1980s and at that time it was very progressive because there were a lot of different uses in four seasons
7974391 i think that now were a little bit more careful about where were placing these things we want to make sure that the roads can handle it that the intersections can handle it
7974392 i do think that this site is too small to support that many more children because of that i cant support it
7974393 there are lots of ways that some of these issues could be resolved from a design point of view
7974394 thered be a way of maybe collecting students at a different location and then bringing them over in a shuttle
7974395 that might exacerbate other problems and maybe even put children in danger so im not without understanding more im not sure if im persuaded that thats a viable solution
7974396 parents come and go so i think what the applicant wants to do is provide the most amount of spaces if you get eight parents there or eight kids coming at one time in a car they want to have as many spaces on the site to drop them off rather than having them dropped off on the street so its a trade off in terms of whether you feel like if this is to be supported you want to see the employees parked on site with less accommodation of the drop offs
7974397 this is against the state license because the parents have to come inside with the children sign them up leave the child and get out
7974398 i am convinced from the staff report that this facility can accommodate that much of an increase with the condition that the number be dropped down to 50 and with the condition that all staff be required to park on site
7974399 it is part of our parking regulations for day care centers its one space per 10 children enrolled in the major class or shift plus one space per employee
7974400 and the standard also requires that a pick up and drop off area shall be provided on the site
7974401 business and economic issues are things that the eastern panhandle pays attention to
7974402 i think theyll be in tune to the ags race and the years of abuse that came from darrell mcgraws office
7974403 i think thats the best way to reach individual citizens to shake their hands and to look them in the eye and tell them about the issues that we feel are important
7974404 we want to go through each and every community door to door phone calls football games fairs festivals and were going to make sure everyone in west virginia has the opportunity to hear our message
7974405 i think that we really owe the citizens of west virginia the opportunity to hear from both candidates and ill be there
7974406 a new profile of the venezuelan will try to be obtained with more discipline and responsibility that values work perseverance credibility conviction analysis and the sporting identity with a focus on four main programs performance sports sports for all sports installations and sports in school
7974407 there is nothing better than physical exercise to prevent cardiovascular accidents including for mental health for the health of the family good blood circulation which brings oxygen to the brain for study to complement the educational effort that we are doing we need to live more and better every day
7974408 im 62 years old and i want to participate in this sporting and musical event because i like to stay energetic
7974409 we do gym we paint we sing and we also go on long hikes which i like so much
7974410 we appreciate all the support that weve been given for national sports i would suggest that the leadership really know sports for the responsibility of directing sports should be in the hands of sports people and ex sports people
7974411 the main reason for its formation was that our sport adapt to the international requirements
7974412 we are ready to break with this imposed model of domination and organize our sports independently with decisions that respond to the national interest
7974413 its important to think about the contribution that sports has in the construction of the new person
7974414 we want a sports that makes and reproduces healthy people who are useful for the country

7974417 if a child asks a question about sex the only appropriate response for a parent is that is a good question and then proceed to answer it parents are the main sex educators of their children whether they like it or not if they want to be askable they must be prepared for any question or incident that involves their childrens sexuality parents must convey to their children that nothing that ever happens to them will be made worse by talking about it to the parents and the best first response is im so glad you are able to talk to me about this

7974427 we hadden het idee al langer omdat veel het veel mensen opviel dat de vleermuizen geen wonden hadden
7974428 vleermuizen vliegen niet zomaar tegen dingen aan ze kunnen juist heel goed dingen ontwijken sterker nog ze zijn zelfs beter in het ontwijken of vangen van bewegende objecten toch was de oplossing iets wat niemand had kunnen voorspellen
7974429 hier vinden we ongeveer tien vleermuizen voor elke vogel een ander probleem is de impact op de populatie we hebben hier negen verschillende vogelsoorten gevonden maar maar twee verschillende vleermuissoorten

7974433 in england according to the local government finance statistics 2008 councils last year made 1 275 000 000 from on and off street parking and spent about 780 million on maintaining and enforcing the regime so the surplus revenue from parking was almost 500 million a phenomenal amount of money last year 8 5 million parking tickets were issued up from 5 7 million in just six years
7974434 in london there are signs that the parking terror may be on the wane the city of westminster where that first parking meter appeared has scrapped its targets incentive schemes and performance related pay for parking attendants it has also removed hundreds of metres of yellow lines and relaxed the rules on clamping and towing away
7974435 it is the disproportionate punishment that most angers people the biggest problem with decriminalised parking regimes is that they remove any discretion for dealing sensibly with a transgression while providing a cash raising incentive for councils

7974445 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7974446 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7974447 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7974448 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7974449 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7974450 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7974451 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7974452 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
7974453 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
7974454 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something

7974463 this is a very interesting heart and should be studied in a research fashion
7974464 every time you share your story and experience with the child you lost it helps you to know and remember that she was real as well as to heal
7974465 most of the time the best course of action lies somewhere in the middle of the two extremes perhaps the fact that he makes both sides just a little uncomfortable is just what this country needs to build true unity it certainly will not come from the extremes as the democratic party is trying to make us believe
7974466 well he didnt lead the hokies to an orange bowl victory
7974467 what you just heard was the birth of a conspiracy between two different men with a single desire to win
7974468 there is a very strong possibility that the committee will be unable to complete its investigation before congress expires that may leave important public concerns regarding the nations federal criminal justice system unaddressed
7974469 simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success
7974470 even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago
7974471 but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
7974472 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
7974473 the republicans are not going to run this convention and cnn is not going to run this convention
7974474 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
7974475 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
7974476 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
7974477 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
7974478 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
7974479 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
7974480 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against climate change
7974481 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
7974482 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
7974483 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
7974484 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
7974485 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
7974486 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
7974487 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now
7974488 we have drills for fires and tornadoes this is just another tool for the toolbox
7974489 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
7974490 for me the whole goal is to stay relevant as long as i can
7974491 its one thing to still be doing it but to still have your records played on the radio and to have contemporary success thats whats exciting
7974492 radio has said to me in so many words if you do great work well play it but if its average youll have to stand in line
7974493 ive always been a country singer with a lot of influences
7974494 and i think thats helped me because i can do a variety of songs
7974495 it seems like bunty is a more urban version of veerappan without some of the romance
7974496 we live in a mud hut with only two rooms i dont know how were going to afford 10 children now
7974497 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
7974498 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
7974499 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
7974500 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
7974501 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
7974502 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse
7974503 i have performed several reductions and have never had a case where i lost all the fetuses she needed to know that
7974504 there are just no rules or protocols for doctors to follow in this country
7974505 laws will be passed and they are not followed or implemented no one had any idea what to do when it came to ghazalas births it sort of all just happened
7974506 women can actually get pregnant with seven eight or nine babies
7974507 we need to tell people that it is safe and that it is ok religiously
7974508 one of the firemen called me and said the place was full of smoke
7974509 we fuss and fuss at people to get surge protectors and they do work
7974510 were fortunate we got the fire call if it hadnt been for that call there is no telling what would have happened to the building
7974511 the recent survey indicates wolves currently occupy about 81 percent of this overall area similar to results from the past two surveys 77 percent and 84 percent considering the estimated margin of error from each survey the population estimates from the past three surveys are statistically similar
7974512 the lack of notable change in wolf numbers is not surprising given that northern deer populations have remained relatively stable since 1998 and most forested portions of northern minnesota are already occupied by wolves
7974513 this survey presents more evidence that the gray wolf continues to be recovered in minnesota and that minnesotas state wolf management program is effectively protecting wolves

7974524 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
7974525 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
7974526 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7974574 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7974575 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan
7974576 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities its linked to the new poverty its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves

7974580 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7974581 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7974582 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7974585 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states
7974586 they had a discussion back in early june about it and he spent more time with sen clinton alone talking about issues than he has with joe biden or anyone else in the last couple of months
7974587 you know john mccain is an older white haired man who has been in the senate over 20 years voted for the iraq war and said barack obama did not have the experience to be president im sorry thats our intro for next week when joe biden is on im sorry i got confused
7974588 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight
7974589 i dont know whether i would have made it through a lot of the tough times in my life without you guys i mean it sincerely
7974590 a rt is valid for the warmth and love it carries within it even if it be the lightest entertainment or the bitterest satire or the most shattering tragedy
7974591 one thing about the delaware valley is its not a homogeneous look we can look like an old city we can look like a brand new city then you can be in the post war american suburbs or have the look of the main line the rolling hills of chester county or old industrial towns
7974592 of course there are vast areas of disagreement issues of human rights political disputes questions like tibet the whole paingful list
7974593 i dont envy those who have the task of opening the games in london
7974594 i believe these olympics will be seen as a turning point even more important than nixons courageous decision to visit china some of the walls we saw china hiding behind were built by the west my mental images my limited views are possibly typical of many westerners even better informed than some
7974595 we no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies the world is a college of corporations inexorabily determined by the immutable bi laws of business
7974596 where else in the world are other states including my own doing such things
7974597 i also pictured tens of millions living in poverty and age old conditions i am sure there are indeed many millions living like that but until fairly recent decades almost all chinese were living in poverty hardly conceivable to the west

7974606 when she became argumentative or she became forceful they said shes bitchy and there were comments about what she was wearing and how she looked sometimes from other women it was disgusting
7974607 women may look at what happened to hillary clinton and think absolutely not i am not going to put myself through that
7974608 but on the other hand i think back to how far women have come in terms of progress when my grandmother was born women couldnt vote and clinton had a very viable campaign and she almost won and by some accounts she actually did win there are now more women governors than ever before and those jobs can be springboards to making a run for the president
7974609 the next hillary clintons are out there strong progressive women who are working hard and looking to get elected
7974610 and for me being a young woman its incredibly inspirational for me to have someone like hillary clinton to look up to in the political process shes motivated so many of us and the sexist treatment of her by the media from where im coming from gave us all the more reason to fight
7974611 i think unfortunately for women that the presidency is viewed as a very masculine office because of its links to the military the fact that the president is the commander in chief its hard for some people to conceptualize a woman being in that position
7974612 there are still so many obstacles that have everything to do with gender there are those who still believe that they feel more comfortable with men in power even other women
7974613 after this it wont be so odd or weird for a woman to be such an exciting viable candidate for president
7974614 it couldnt be anything better than something to help pay for lauras education this is a major event in our family

7974618 im living in the house of the guy who fired me its weird
7974619 coach johnson you would see him but he sat back and let the coaches coach the individual positions said senior offensive guard anthony gaskins
7974620 coach niumat does that but hes real hands on he runs around and wants to see everything even all summer youd be lifting and hes right behind you while youre squatting asking you how are you doing
7974621 i cant worry about the way paul coached or what he did im just going to be who i am a phenomenal coach had a phenomenal run hopefully we can continue on with what he did and what he established
7974622 there are no excuses said niumatalolo whose coaching debut actually came when the midshipmen lost to utah 35 32 in last seasons poinsettia bowl
7974623 whether this comes back to bite me thats the truth
7974624 all that we have to be successful is in place weve got great kids weve got a great coaching staff if i dont get it done its nobodys fault but mine
7974625 ive always put my own pressures on myself this profession is a bottom line profession
7974626 the pressure to win to beat towson and all the people we play its like that every year
7974627 obviously im involved with a lot more decisions and stuff but ive always been a competitor i hate to lose
7974628 it was a blessing in disguise niumatalolo said of working for the former southern cal icon
7974629 it was a great learning experience for me to be around a guy like that
7974630 its kind of funny looking back on it it wasnt funny back then
7974631 i tell the story to my kids every time i pass the mcdonalds i say remember when i got fired there

7974635 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
7974636 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war but we of course dont want it
7974637 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners in the west
7974638 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision and the situation will be calm
7974639 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7974640 the black sea is just a small pool for their arms with the range of 2 500 kilometers
7974641 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7974642 it is the first attempt in europe since nazi germany and stalin of a big country to annex the territory of another country
7974643 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
7974644 but it will result in russias isolation from the world

7974664 the numbers released today show the potential power of public insurance programs to provide desperately needed coverage to uninsured americans
7974665 this decline in employer sponsored insurance rings a real alarm bell warning us that fewer and fewer women and men are able to get health insurance from their employers
7974666 once again we have seen strong evidence of health disparities in our country
7974667 we must be committed as a nation to make health coverage a basic human right and ensuring that everyone has access to health care

7974743 the contribution of solar variability to global warming is negligible to a certainty of 95
7974744 the statistical variability in earths average temperature is interpreted as noise
7974745 the variations in earths temperature are not noise but contain substantial information about the source of variability
7974746 variations in tsi are indicative of the suns turbulent dynamics
7974747 changes in the number duration and intensity of solar flares and sunspots and by the intermittency in the time intervals between dark spots and bright faculae
7974748 move the global temperature up and down for tens or even hundreds of years
7974749 both the fluctuations in tsi using the solar flare time series as a surrogate and earths average temperature time series are observed to have inverse power law statistical distributions
7974750 turns out to be the same for both the solar flare and temperature anomaly time series
7974751 the statistics of the temperature anomalies inherit the statistical structure that was evident in the intermittency of the solar flare data
7974752 the sun is influencing climate significantly more than the ipcc report claims
7974753 the current anthropogenic contribution to global warming is significantly over estimated
7974754 estimate that the sun could account for as much as 69 of the increase in earths average temperature depending on the tsi reconstruction used

7974765 nella mia vita ho sempre cercato la risposta al mistero di dio ha continuato magari anche ingenuamente e incoscientemente ma ho scoperto con stupore un disegno buono sulla mia vita
7974766 per rispondere devo rimanere in rapporto con dio perch il s a cristo sempre un s a persone e circostanze concrete per questo mi interessava di pi il s che continuare a sognare circostanze favorevoli al mio temperamento ci che fa fiorire il deserto lofferta quotidiana perch anche la vita di tutti i giorni di un vescovo piena di cose aride ma questa unoccasione di protagonismo solo se si offre ogni cosa a cristo
7974767 oggi ci si arresta a livello di analisi della situazione dimenticando qual la priorit e il punto di partenza per chi vive in cristo lecumenismo infatti landare verso laltro col desiderio di conoscere la verit in lui presente attraverso di me la presenza di cristo tende a diventare trasparente e questo lo posso vedere nella mia amicizia con alcuni preti ortodossi con i quali ci troviamo in incontri informali che hanno a tema leducazione di noi stessi e di chi incontriamo
7974768 in his career making speech at the 2004 democratic convention obama ridiculed
7974769 like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats

7974771 our vision statement is an american society that affirms and practices judeo christian values rooted in biblical authority
7974772 america will be better off if people who are voting are seeking gods guidance
7974773 i dont have any information that would suggest that our military commanders in afghanistan dont believe still that this was a legitimate strike on a taliban target
7974774 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
7974775 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law
7974776 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7974777 residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7974778 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7974779 in a facility like this the possibility for injury is enormous
7974780 its pretty standard to lose an eye lose a limb lose a life were going to have a government that makes sure workers arent put at unnecessary risk
7974781 she was good i could not have been more proud of her and she also looked cute which didnt hurt
7974782 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
7974783 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
7974784 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
7974785 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
7974786 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels

7974791 this is rigorous they are going to learn about physics they are going to learn about design they are going to learn to think for themselves
7974792 there has been some revamping through the years but we knew we needed a major overhaul things have changed so much
7974793 i had some ideas then i realized that the best thing to do was to junk my ideas and let them do it
7974794 it teaches you the basic structure and you can relate it to a lot of programs we wanted to do robot interfaces also and python is good for that
7974795 in college they do a lot of drawing like this
7974796 i think it will be good preparation for college especially for mechanical and architectural engineers
7974797 you dont need a textbook technology is changing so rapidly that it will be easy for us to take a module out plug a module in and constantly stay up to date

7974802 too much and too long we seem to have surrendered community excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things
7974803 yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials it measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile and it tells us everything about america except why we are proud that we are americans

7974806 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

7974813 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
7974814 but we need to prepare our members for the eventuality that they could be called on to start manning picket lines
7974815 we are optimistic that a fair and reasonable settlement will be reached before the contract expiration date
7974816 we came in with open arms to the iraqi army
7974817 a big reason adel and jameaa are good now is because of the partnership with the ia they actually worked with them hand in hand the civilians feel a lot better when its a partnership they feel like its twice as secure
7974818 almost immediately people began to come out of their homes
7974819 these people deserve to live in peace after al qaeda had oppressed them for so long
7974820 however i dont think locals would have felt comfortable with putting a coalition outpost next to the mosque without help from the iraqis
7974821 those who dwell as scientists or laymen among the beauties and mysteries of the earth are never alone or weary of life
7974822 to have that kind of data is hugely valuable and the list of applications is endless and spans all of biology
7974823 but it all hinges on building an accurate database our study is a cautionary tale if were going to do it lets do it right
7974824 i recognize that some who do dna barcoding may be upset by this study but that is the nature of science
7974825 building a genetic library of all life is a great goal but we need to be careful to pay attention to the data that go into that library to make sure they are accurate
7974826 scientists have been so preoccupied with creating a bar code of life that they have not been careful in monitoring the accuracy of the underlying data
7974827 it is like attempting to assemble a library on american history without bothering to filter out books on forrest gump and harry potter

7974830 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
7974831 i look at this and i am about to jump out of my chair
7974832 weve let the republicans turn this into a referendum on barack obama when the countrys going down the tubes and weve got the most unpopular president in living memory we have to reclaim the agenda
7974833 opening night began the job of filling out obamas profile for skeptical voters but what it lacked was any effort to frame for the electorate the choices in november or the case against the republican candidate
7974834 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
7974835 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
7974836 if the uk had to provide for itself from its own resources it could support a population of only 17 million 43 million less than its latest official population figure
7974837 to live sustainably the current uk population of 60 million would have to reduce its average individual footprint by more than 70 per cent this would mean britons living a lifestyle similar to citizens of countries such as china paraguay algeria botswana and the dominican republic
7974838 even a zero carbon britain would have a maximum sustainable population of 40 million if it refused to change its lifestyle and its non carbon footprint therefore remained unaltered
7974839 a zero carbon uk could never reach sustainability without population reduction the lifestyle reductions demanded would be too great
7974840 there is an urgent need for national strategies on sustainable population not only in the uk but in all countries politicians need to demonstrate courage and leadership on this issue they must persuade their nations to accept the necessity of smaller families and provide the means for people to reduce their family size
7974841 throughout history different cultures have celebrated birth as a unique moment signifying the joy of life the reinterpretation of a new birth as greenhouse unfriendly behaviour speaks to todays degraded imagination where carbon reduction has become the supreme moral imperative
7974842 subjecting the act of birth itself that once celebrated creation of a new life to the polluter pays principle exposes the dark side of todays misanthropic imagination

7974844 georgian president mikheil saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks
7974845 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
7974846 this decision is completely illegal and has no legal basis
7974847 as far as involvement in other conflicts is concerned we naturally are not going to do this
7974848 but russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
7974849 it the eu calls for a political solution to the conflicts in georgia it will examine the consequences of russias decision from this point of view
7974850 nothing scares us including the prospect of a cold war but we dont want it
7974851 in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
7974852 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7974853 one more step towards the self isolation of the russian federation from the international community
7974854 kennedys attitude seems to be to hell with the political process to hell with the first amendment to hell with my integrity and to hell with the herald and its readers
7974855 ailing ted k rises to occasion gives rousing speech in denver
7974856 we havent sat down and said now that the guy is hurting lets covering him in a different way
7974857 i think our natural inclination as a tabloid is to pull for the underdog and certainly in his fight with cancer the senator is that
7974858 i think there were some very hard feelings between the senator and the paper when he forced murdoch to divest himself of us and im sure there have been hard feelings on the senators part about some of the positions weve taken and the way weve played things but you know in the end its the opposite of irish alzheimers where only the grudges remain in the end you just sort of let that stuff go and follow the story wherever it takes you my sense is that if you went back over our kennedy coverage over the last 10 years youd see that within the last 4 or 5 years theres been a general warming toward kennedy as old grudges were basically forgotten
7974859 our idea with todays coverage was that kennedys speech was by far the most dramatic thing that happened yesterday
7974860 holy hell she looks awesome shes gotta be what in her late 40s dude
7974861 is an incorrect tag for the national if this non artist appears in your charts do last fm and yourself a favor fix your artist tags
7974862 come and enjoy what we have done is the truth is that it has been very fun drive by these tracks and in these conditions the special were very slippery and i had to go with very careful
7974863 current position does not do justice to our needs and demands and does not match the pattern set by the u s steel agreement
7974864 but we need to prepare our members for the eventuality that they could be called on to start manning picket lines
7974865 we are optimistic that a fair and reasonable settlement will be reached before the contract expiration date
7974866 our airmen and other coalition forces are helping iraq achieve a stable government and ultimately helping the united states and our allies to defeat terrorism

7974872 why do bad things happen why is there suffering in the world
7974873 little soul do not be sad for the suffering you see unlocks the love in peoples hearts
7974874 have you not noticed the goodness and love that is the offspring of that suffering look at how people come together drop their differences and show their love and compassion for those who suffer all their other motivations disappear and they become motivated by love alone
7974875 the suffering soul unlocks the love in peoples hearts much like the sun and rain unlock the flower within the seed i created everyone with endless love in their heart but unfortunately most people keep it locked up and hardly share it with anyone they are afraid to let their love shine freely because they are afraid of being hurt but a suffering soul unlocks that love i tell you this it is the greatest miracle of all many souls have bravely chosen to go into the world and suffer to unlock this love to create this miracle for the good of all humanity
7974876 i am brave let me go i would love to go into the world and suffer so that i can unlock the goodness and love in peoples hearts i want to create that miracle
7974877 you are a brave soul i know and thus i will grant your request but even though you are very brave you will not be able to do this alone i have known since the beginning of time that you would ask for this and so i carefully selected many souls to care for you on your journey these souls will help create your miracle however they will also share in your suffering two of these souls are most special and will care for you help you and suffer along with you far beyond the others they have already chosen a name for you
7974878 do not forget little soul that i will be with you always although you have agreed to bear the pain you will do so through my strength and if the time should come when you feel that you have suffered enough just say the word think the thought and you will be healed
7974879 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7974880 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7974881 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7974882 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7974883 confirmed that he clearly understood that this was a top priority for the company at this time due to the imminent announcement of the record date of the extraordinary dividend
7974884 that he would ensure that the transfer agent was in possession of all cancellation requests within days

7974922 i saw it take a hubcap off the car then start walking towards us
7974923 it put the hubcap down and then banged on the window as if it was trying to get my attention
7974924 it was almost like it wanted to give me the wheel cap
7974925 the prime ministers visit is vital not only for the government and security officials but for the people of diyala to see that their effort in achieving peace and fighting against terrorist groups does not go unnoticed
7974926 this is a great day for diyala province because the prime minister is among us

7974930 we are fighting against the terrorists and we will prevail
7974931 iraq is not only for some people its for everyone
7974932 we cannot ignore our nation and we have to be united in our efforts to build iraq
7974933 the tribes have to support the government in its war against the terrorists they play a big role
7974934 iraq with all its rich resources and people can eliminate all kind of threats
7974935 we will all work together for the prosperity of this country and we will not let anyone interfere with our affairs or with the political process
7974936 the ultimate success of diyala lies in the hands of the people
7974937 todays meeting continued to prove that the governments both central and provincial care greatly for the peoples safety security and well being
7974938 the will of the government drives the hope of the people
7974939 and i hope todays visit along with recent operations throughout diyala continue to restore that hope a hope that the terrorists tried to destroy but couldnt

7974941 harry reeders gifts of communication and leadership are legendary his new book is not only a source of spiritual wisdom but a manual on the practical application of the principles of biblical leadership within the church this book is a must read for anyone serving in or desiring to serve in church leadership as it reflects the hands on experience of one of the most effective senior pastors in america today
7974942 harry reeders concern for leader development is much more that a jeremiad against pop theories of vision casting and profit driven pragmatism his urgent call to develop biblical leaders who are courageous compassionate and selfless is a battle cry to rescue our nation our culture and our churches from the suffocation of self gratification he urges leaders to rise above idols of success and to discover their true greatness in biblical integrity generational mentoring and service to divine purposes the examples are inspiring and the challenge to change the world by honoring god throbs in the veins of the book
7974943 this book is a call and a challenge to christians it instructs and encourages harry reeder is disturbed by the thought that churches have entrusted the world with defining what it means to be a leader in this book harry reeder tries to take that job back and with it he gives us some specific help in knowing how we can develop and deploy those leaders in the church and beyond
7974944 whether leaders are born or made or both harry reeder is a leader who knows how to develop other leaders drawing on a deep understanding of scripture a lifetime of ministry in the church and a practical knowledge of military history dr reeder lays out clear biblical principles for success in spiritual leadership while at the same time warning against the dangers that constantly threaten to destroy men who serve god in ministry
7974945 harry reeder is a leader more than that harry is committed to developing and deploying other leaders it is important that a book on leadership is written by one who models what he writes this book will be a great help to any who want to produce leaders throughout our churches and the culture with godly character and servant hearts and courageous conviction with compelling and motivating examples and many practical suggestions this book will challenge you to be a leader and to develop other leaders and help you do both
7974946 harry makes the point that the best leadership models are those grounded in gods word we want to develop such leaders who then multiply through mentoring others in this way the church will impact the culture and the world such leaders are desperately needed and harry is gifted at developing them here is the methodology dont miss it

7974954 they told me the taliban comes in at night driving through the village to harass and intimidate the people
7974955 this is where we assist the ansf in their mission
7974956 thats part of our role here to allow the establishment of their government in their own country
7974957 when a police chief or government official comes down to see them it makes the people feel like they are loved and cared for
7974958 the whole thing is for us to separate the taliban from the people
7974959 these people are afraid of the insurgency and unsure of their government
7974960 but thats why we are here to help them establish those relationships and show them that the ansf and iroa are going to give them that sense of security
7974961 by providing that link between the people and their government while simultaneously distancing the insurgency from the people is exactly the way to slow down the emplacement of ieds in these remote towns and villages
7974962 we have an actual gay character whose sexuality isnt the focal point of who he is and is treated matter of factly

7974966 there is tremendous legislative support in both parties and both chambers for renewable energy and were hopeful that federal legislators see the benefits in extending the investment tax credit for renewable energy beyond 2008
7974967 there is great importance in being part of the democratic convention to showcase the practical use of solar energy to our nations leaders and also for the democratic party to set an example for clean and responsible energy use
7974968 it is an honor for the team at pv powered to be working side by side with leading u s manufacturers and installation partners from the solar power industry
7974969 highlighting solar power at the democratic national convention will hopefully put the critically important federal tax incentive back into the public debate

7974977 so now pirating is so dangerous and illegal that people have to go live in fucking somalia to bring us illegal downloads of rhianna and jonas brothers music damn someone should really throw a benefit to help these people or something

7974982 our next big goal is do what you did in colorado
7974983 oh crap the black dudes really is gonna be our guy time to jump ship
7974984 to match the average wage a man earns in 12 months in the financial year working full time ordinary hours a woman has to work an extra 54 days or a total of 14 weeks to earn the same
7974985 on the edge of arlington cemetery at a small theater inside the women in military service memorial
7974986 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
7974987 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
7974988 we give them the potent combination of insight and analysis a one two punch that helps companies cut costs quickly and easily given the market pressures to deliver bottom line growth in a difficult environment we are very optimistic about growing the market in the us and globally
7974989 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7974990 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7974991 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7974992 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
7974993 the average size group for this type of mission is usually two platoons were doing it with about half
7974994 we train constantly so that we are comfortable with each other the marines know what type of air power they have behind them we believe there is no objective we cant handle
7974995 the food drops are our way to show that we are on their side
7974996 in the city this might not be a big deal but this food could mean life or death to these people there is nothing out there in the far desert maybe it will keep them happy enough to have them stay working with us and not the terrorists
7974997 with a unit this small conducting the operation it is real easy to maneuver
7974998 we can get in hit the objective and get out in about 20 minutes
7974999 these missions give us a presence in an area which hasnt had any coalition forces in it for years or even ever
7975000 this will keep the bad guys on their toes and that is really what were going for keep them guessing so we can catch up to them and get them
7975001 the marines showed the ethos of being a professional warrior today
7975002 they showed the people were here to provide help to them
7975003 we are able to reach far into the desert winds and help some people who we had no contact with before
7975004 we are conducting these missions in a nonstandard way before they were ground driven now we bring the air element to the fight
7975005 these missions provide us with the opportunity to hit the enemy before they hit us
7975006 we will continue to do it because of all the positive effects it has on the people and on our mission here in ramadi
7975007 outsourcing ecommerce technology is becoming a thing of the past
7975008 companies are looking to insource technology without the responsibility of managing teams of developers the trend we are experiencing today is organizations replacing outsourced solutions and large custom solutions with best of breed ecommerce software products like insitecommerce
7975009 our technology removes the middle man and our easy to use tool set eliminates the need for technical expertise in house to manage the site
7975010 companies are taking this opportunity to upgrade to insites solutions the result is complete control over their websites and increased responsiveness in a continually challenging and competitive environment
7975011 i believe since it started in the sovereign state of darfur it is more likely something to do with the rebels in that area
7975012 it really made us think differently about how we dealt with each organization because if we gave one one thing we had to give it to everyone
7975013 it would become a huge number if we gave one an extra half a percent wed have to give it to all of them it really made it difficult to negotiate with the different organizations
7975014 i think those me too clauses are a good thing
7975015 what youre seeing with the me too clauses is employees saying benefits and raises need to be the same because were all living in the same economy
7975016 i would say i have exceeded the dreams that i ever had and have had a great life here work for a great company and it s really just amazing
7975017 we wrestled all the way through the troubles with both my grandfathers who were also in the wrestling business my sister was a referee too and my mother helped my dad run the actual wrestling business that was part of my training teaching and then suddenly i was wrestling myself
7975018 according to our survey results current economic conditions have not yet made a significant impact on the revenue targets of companies within the industrial sector but there is concern over rising costs
7975019 companies looking to gain their share of market opportunity during these uncertain times should consider prioritizing marketing investments by focusing on programs that provide a greater return and offer a consistent ongoing presence in front of a targeted audience they can also benefit from expanding sales and increasing product lines to reach a broader and deeper audience than ever before to allow for additional sales opportunities we are seeing companies continuing to invest with globalspec the type of program that delivers roi and results

7975039 i am not going to fail to protect these kids as long as we have a single solitary troop in iraq

7975042 did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative
7975043 weaken significantly financial conditions remained unfavorable consumer and business confidence was downbeat and manufacturing activity was contracting
7975044 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
7975045 although the decision was largely anticipated the policy statement was reportedly viewed by investors as placing more emphasis on the downside risks to growth than they had anticipated
7975046 i n light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations uncertainty about the inflation outlook remained high
7975047 some foreign economies would tend to dampen export gains going forward
7975048 less than its potential rate through the first half of next year
7975049 the unemployment rate jumped during the intermeeting period and participants generally anticipated that payroll employment would decline further in coming months

7975132 in addition members saw continuing downside risks to this outlook particularly reflecting possible further deterioration in financial conditions
7975133 although measures of core inflation might well edge up later this year given the pass through to final goods prices of earlier increases in the prices of energy and other inputs most participants anticipated that core inflation would edge back down during 2009
7975134 i think the statement is pretty dovish on inflation there is a lot more text discussing the weakness on the economy like consumer spending there seems more emphasis on the downside risks to growth

7975139 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7975140 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7975141 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7975142 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7975143 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7975144 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7975145 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7975146 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7975147 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
7975148 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7975149 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7975150 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7975151 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7975152 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7975153 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7975154 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7975155 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7975156 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7975157 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
7975158 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7975159 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7975160 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7975161 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7975162 how much celebrity drivel weather reports local cop chases and corporate cover ups from the
7975163 undoing legislation already passed by that other pesky branch of government the legislative
7975164 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7975165 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7975166 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7975167 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7975168 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7975169 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7975170 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7975171 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7975172 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7975173 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7975174 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7975175 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7975176 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7975177 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7975178 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7975179 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7975180 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7975181 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7975182 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7975183 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people

7975189 ser a un honor representar a mi pa s en los juegos de londres y tratar de revalidad el oro ol mpico
7975190 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7975191 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7975192 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7975193 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7975194 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7975195 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7975196 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7975197 the thing that is important to know about the catholic vote
7975198 theres also a large middle and a lot of catholics make their choice case by case election by election
7975199 since lyndon johnsons landslide election in 1964 theres been a slow trickling away of catholics from the democratic party
7975200 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7975201 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7975202 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7975203 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7975204 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7975205 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7975206 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
7975207 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
7975208 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
7975209 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7975210 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7975211 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7975212 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7975213 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7975214 knowing they will have a first lady who understands their challenges
7975215 back in june and july i truly thought he was going to blow mccain out of the water and carry 30 or 40 states
7975216 what has happened is that republicans mccain specifically have really twisted his great charisma this electric personality to discredit his ability his experience his capacity his judgment i fear they are about to do to him what they did to gore
7975217 obama has got to do some things that will shore up his ability to lead not just to charm but to lead theyve got to give credibility to his understanding of foreign policy his ability to deal with tough people and tough questions and his ability to be more explicit and convincing on his health care policies and energy policies
7975218 normally i might say these conventions are not so important but i dont think thats the case this year
7975219 i think in the case of mccain they need to frame him
7975220 viscerally my feeling is theyve got to come back at him hard
7975221 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7975222 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7975223 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7975224 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7975225 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7975226 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7975227 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7975228 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7975229 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7975230 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7975231 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7975232 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7975233 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7975234 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7975235 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7975236 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7975237 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7975238 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7975239 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7975240 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7975241 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7975242 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7975243 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7975244 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7975245 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7975246 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7975247 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7975248 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7975249 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
7975250 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
7975251 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7975252 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7975253 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7975254 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7975255 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7975256 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7975257 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7975258 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7975259 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7975260 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7975261 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7975262 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7975263 madonna shows that obama has no chance against mccains gang
7975264 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7975265 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7975266 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7975267 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7975268 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7975269 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7975270 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7975271 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7975272 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7975273 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7975274 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7975275 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7975276 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7975277 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7975278 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7975279 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7975280 windows move maker connot save the movie to the specifiec location
7975281 this area of ramadi used to be one of the most dangerous
7975282 every day there were bombs and insurgents fighting the coalition now this area is so quiet that it may even be considered the best in the city
7975283 i believe that most of this is due to the iraqi army patrolling this area constantly bad guys would walk these streets as if they owned them then the iraqi army started patrolling here and they havent been back since
7975284 i talked to them with my heart open i will do anything for these people whether i share a joke give them candy or just listen to their problems i do it all with an open heart i do it because if i help them they will help me
7975285 i try to teach my men to respect the people here because they could save our lives
7975286 if we show them respect they will show us respect and help us fight the insurgency
7975287 my goal here is to help the good people of ramadi rid themselves of the insurgency that plagues them i want all of this country to be safe
7975288 if it starts here in ramadi then so be it i know that my men and i are doing a very good job i will terminate as many insurgents as i can until there are no more to fight then i will know we are done here but we will move to the next city to do the same for them
7975289 consumer spending online is an indicator for consumer preferences attitudes and offline trends in society
7975290 the index results show a significant shift in consumer behavior especially among female consumers we have noticed that as compared to men a higher percentage of women are concerned with fraud identity theft and the economy in fact 38 of women said that they would purchase more online if they could control their finances and pay using cash
7975291 we thought it was most important to bring this critical information to the retail industry and give online retailers a projection of consumer spending for the upcoming quarter and an opportunity to gain critical insight on customer behavior
7975292 we look forward to releasing this data quarterly to provide a snapshot of consumer online shopping activity and track the various trends that will be uncovered
7975293 on the basis of historical and recent performance versus the peer group and the healthcare it index as a whole and in light of the largely positive analyst outlook for the company we conclude change is not warranted from a performance perspective
7975294 as the dissidents have neither demonstrated that the replacement of the current board is warranted nor that the opposition slate is better qualified to oversee the company let alone voiced a new or compelling different strategy for the company we believe shareholders would be better served by re electing the management slate of directors who have delivered the superior results of the past five years
7975295 we are extremely pleased that the countrys three leading independent proxy advisory firms have recognized the strengths of our board nominees who possess a keen understanding of the company and understand our strategy to continue building shareholder value under the guidance of our current board nominees the company has implemented a strategic plan that is generating strong returns for our shareholders in our recent quarterly earnings announcement net revenues jumped 31 and our board approved a 20 dividend increase which we believe are indisputable signs of our boards success we believe the most effective way to continue this momentum is to elect the entire quality systems board slate and to reject the independent director proposal
7975296 although we are disappointed with riskmetrics decision on the bylaw proposal which we believe ignores the risk associated with the potential change in the companys bylaws and the real agenda inherent in the proposal we understand they have written guidelines that they had to abide by
7975297 found no evidence to support the claim that the boards governance is preventing the company from achieving its full potential
7975298 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
7975299 this transaction is consistent with our strategy of adding leading investment businesses to our platform amf has a significant pipeline due to the demand for capital from a significant number of high quality asset managers in addition amf has significant opportunities for growth outside the us we look forward to leveraging our single center of excellence model to expand and grow amfs business we warmly welcome norton and his team to the credit suisse family
7975300 amf has made great strides in its first five years and this is an exciting new stage in our evolution having credit suisse as a partner will bring global resources and scale to amf and its partner firms and we are excited to be associated with this world class organization our partnership with credit suisse will strengthen our ability to identify and attract exceptional investment managers with strong growth potential it is a win win for all
7975301 it depends on whether theyre able to develop and publish the evidence
7975302 to prove theres not a negative difference in the impact on young people
7975303 from my experience theyre going to acquire alcohol from somewhere
7975304 forcing them to do this behind the scenes does not provide proper respect for the law
7975305 seems to be something they should be allowed to do
7975306 to me an 18 year old is drinking anyway on campus
7975307 in my opinion it will increase alcohol consumption because itll be legal so anybody underage will not have to go out and work at having alcohol bought for them
7975308 as an old guy whose been there and done that
7975309 i just hope they finally get him and put him away
7975310 running him out of the neighborhood was the best thing that ever happened here

7975314 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7975315 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7975316 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7975317 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7975318 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7975319 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7975320 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7975321 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7975322 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7975323 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7975324 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7975325 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7975326 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7975327 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7975328 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7975329 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7975330 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7975331 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7975332 but who has time to get to the farmers market let alone plant a garden
7975333 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7975334 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7975335 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7975336 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7975337 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7975338 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7975339 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7975340 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7975341 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7975342 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7975343 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7975344 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7975345 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7975346 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7975347 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7975348 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7975349 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7975350 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7975351 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7975352 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7975353 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7975354 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7975355 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7975356 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7975357 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7975358 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7975359 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7975360 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7975361 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7975362 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7975363 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7975364 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7975365 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7975366 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7975367 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7975368 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7975369 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7975370 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7975371 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7975372 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7975373 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7975374 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7975375 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7975376 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7975377 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7975378 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7975379 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7975380 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7975381 the old police station was right down the road from the new one
7975382 it had three rooms and the front of the building was a mosque it wasnt fit for jurisdiction in wahida
7975383 it is very nice to have the new police station here in wahida
7975384 i would like for you to all be equal to work as one to serve the community and enforce the law
7975385 many people believed the government was getting all this money and they would never see it
7975386 this project proves the government is spending the money on their communities
7975387 the problem with many of these projects is that one unit is there for the beginning and then has to leave so another unit gets to the final outcome
7975388 i am glad i was able to see the conception on paper all the way up to the building we see today
7975389 this project gives the good people of wahida confidence in their police
7975390 the project was iraqi driven which means we are coming along the way we have always wanted we want to help the iraqi people help themselves the best solutions are the iraqi solutions
7975391 on a larger scale our job provides open range of communication for personnel involved because everything going on the ground affects each others mission
7975392 if its a boring day for us then our comrades on the ground are not being attacked
7975393 i like knowing that i am able to help from up in the sky
7975394 this is so those responding know how to properly treat the patient on arrival and where to go
7975395 its important that if one guy needs to get a hold of us we are here
7975396 its cool to deploy here to do the job were trained to do
7975397 matale village school is a gift from the people of the united states of america to the people of the united republic of tanzania dedicated july 2007 by ambassador michael l retzer
7975398 on behalf of the american people i wish to congratulate the matale community and i would like to encourage the children of matale to study hard in the classroom
7975399 i explained to my wife what we were doing for the children of matale village and she decided to contact my childrens teachers at rhodes elementary and propose a sort of school partnership not only to help the children and teachers of matale but to educate the children at rhodes about the culture of the island of pemba
7975400 i have never seen so many beautiful children and so much hope while we celebrate these beautiful new buildings today we also celebrate the friendship and partnership between the people of the united states and tanzania
7975401 captain bob you and your team did a good job
7975402 the project results exceeded everyones expectations and will undoubtedly contribute to increased quality of life and opportunity for the children of pemba
7975403 the gendarmeria type training provided by the carabinieri will help establish the iraqi national police as a professional military police force filling the gap between the police and the armed forces
7975404 the training will build on the very effective basic training that the civilian police assistance training team cpatt already provides for the national police since 2004
7975405 it is not intended to replace that training in any way it is a specialization that builds upon the basis that cpatt has laid and continues to provide for the national police
7975406 the national police can connect with the public in a way that armed forces cannot and the nato training mission in iraq considers that the training the carabinieri provides will help build the iraqi peoples trust in the national police
7975407 the nato training mission in iraq has had success in helping build up leadership training for the iraqi armed forces and is committed to support the iraqi national police training to its fulfillment
7975408 men we are here today to put the motherlands plan into action we will march across the united states and conquer them their days of freedom are numbered but first we will hit their power stations let them tremble with fear in the dark let the shadows we hide in melt into the night as we ready ourselves to spring forth and conquer democracy
7975409 atomiser check nuclear particle transmitter check random particle oscilloscope check neutron wave subprime meter check what a beautiful day to be enjoying my freedom as an american
7975410 prepare yourselves men capitalism makes people dangerous and violent be in tune with your surroundings everyone follow me
7975411 north bend is the one place ive always known where everyone is nice and always in a good mood you feel comfortable walking down the street
7975412 in high school i took an art class every term
7975413 i did everything from painting to molding jars of clay
7975414 after a while my teachers kind of realized that i loved to draw so i really didnt have to do what the rest of the class was doing theyd just let me chill out and draw
7975415 just a simple drawing of a vase and a flower
7975416 i remember sitting on the couch watching tv and a commercial came on for an art institute i asked myself should i pursue an art career or the marine corps and no kidding the next commercial that came on was the marine corps commercial the one where the guy is climbing and i pretty much made up my mind then
7975417 im always training or working on my weapon system or something i worry that ill lose my skills this isnt like riding a bike you know
7975418 when he came to us from security forces he didnt really know anyone and his drawing has been a great way to get to know everybody
7975419 they just grabbed a magazine they had and the squad leaders picked out two pictures theyre focusing on the art and its a contest the subject matter makes for added difficulty shading legs and the detail of the hair and everything
7975420 howland stayed up all night working on the drawing and when the marines woke up this morning they had something nice to look at he sacrificed his sleep for the morale and welfare of his fellow marines
7975421 if she was satan i wouldnt mind going to hell

7975442 hey did you hear the one about the man who bought a present for his wife

7975450 hmmm you make a convincing point plus id hate to be the only one not doing this id have miss out on being able to talk about it afterwards
7975451 now mexico how on earth do they expect to be accepted modern society if they only eat corn its ridiculous and all that fighting they did with the founding fathers and they want a new mexico for that no way i dont think so
7975452 ah fellows rock its really a much nicer place now that they put this car park in
7975453 dear could you pass me my picnic pipe from the glove box
7975454 hey you guys hear they found some zombies in the westpoint mall they reckon someone let them in there on purpose
7975455 what thats what they are arent they they eat human and they walk real slow
7975456 you know thats not p c though dont you its better if you call them the humanity impaired

7975459 nah i reckon i could survive that remember that guy in fort carson
7975460 he was shot in the face with a stat gun and walked away
7975461 is that the same one that saw the meteor hit the moon
7975462 or the one that saw the assassination of president lookinn
7975463 the same one that claimed he saw a cow eat four men then commit ritual suicide on a fence post
7975464 look it happened they found them in the car park with one of those banners wrapped around them
7975465 zombies are people to or something like that its some movement like those ones from the old world green peace and stuff like that who cares bunch of whackos protecting stupid zombies
7975466 no one is ever going to go for that plan its ridiculous
7975467 you cant put zombies on treadmills and use them as some sort of fuel source
7975468 you just dont want to see a successful treadmill industry do you
7975469 finally the transformation is complete he is now chicken boy auuhhhhhhhh
7975470 you i thought i told you after last time never to return
7975471 it has been and remains a strategically significant geographic location because of the trade routes through the country kandahar itself dates back to alexander the great who the afghans still hold in high esteem
7975472 the change of command follows a 12 month period that started july 2006 when the official kaf to nato transfer of authority happened
7975473 over the year between the transfer of authority and the change of command the u s remained the lead nation as nato grew their capabilities to support the logistics operations and the installation infrastructure
7975474 u s forces will continue to perform a wide range of missions in support of operation enduring freedom and isaf using kaf as a power projection platform
7975475 timely and uninterrupted logistic support to all u s forces is our mission
7975476 kandahar is a major tactical objective for the enemy forces
7975477 if they can separate kandahar from kabul they will consider that victory
7975478 in this business you fight the fight for those that replace you
7975479 the reality of the nce is that it is here to stay to support the u s presence in rc south as long as were needed
7975480 hey scruffs come here boy lets go and see if we can find a cave or a mineshaft
7975481 boy scruffs this penny sure is stuck in there i think i need a better spot to put my candy money
7975482 we have to go there are communists at the power station we need to warn people
7975483 dear american god of freedom and constitutional gun ownership is this true or just some kind of sick joke
7975484 i swear its all true sir we have to go and warn the national guard and the president
7975485 retrieve the captain quickly he is very important to the mission
7975486 you there capitalist pig dog how do we get him out of there
7975487 well you can either lower a ladder or use a rope you should take a vote to decide which is better
7975488 quick just leap in and save the captain we need him to complete the mission
7975489 soldiers we have no time to stop to the control room
7975490 sir could we dry off i suspect it doesnt fit the manifesto to over throw democracy whilst wet
7975491 you are right soldier quick everyone spread out and search for something that we can use to dry ourselves of this oppressive yankie wetness
7975492 here this its an x rrr aa yyy machine this has to be it
7975493 satisfactory work comrade soon we will be dry and the west will fall under our grip turn on the x ray machine
7975494 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7975495 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7975496 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7975497 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7975498 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7975499 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7975500 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7975501 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7975502 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7975503 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7975504 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7975505 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7975506 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7975507 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7975508 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7975509 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7975510 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7975511 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7975512 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7975513 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7975514 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7975515 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7975516 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7975517 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7975518 schreibt der autor carsten volkery ber hubertus heil der aktuell vom parteitag der demokraten
7975519 mit seinem twitter blog gibt heil sich erneut den sp ttern preis
7975520 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7975521 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7975522 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7975523 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7975524 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7975525 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7975526 the american leader who has been condemned throughout his presidency for failing to tackle climate change ended a private meeting with the words
7975527 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7975528 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7975529 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7975530 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7975531 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7975532 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7975533 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7975534 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7975535 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7975536 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7975537 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7975538 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7975539 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7975540 come on now billy we have to go its important we are back before four oclock so your mother can make my dinner
7975541 im sorry dear i just could find my other ear ring
7975542 ha ha ha ha no one wants to here about pots and pans sweetie i think its best if you just keep your mouth closed until i ask you to speak
7975543 billy how about you what do you want me to talk about
7975544 ah yes sweden filthy clock making commies now the reason that god hates the swedes is simple its the cheese all the dam holes in it any country that makes a cheese and then puts holes in it is truly in the grips of satan swiss cheese is evil creamily textured evil with bite
7975545 so family lets go for a drive out to the badlands
7975546 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7975547 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7975548 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7975549 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7975550 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7975551 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7975552 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7975553 what is the difference between conventional dentures and immediate dentures
7975554 organizations often lack the traceability and efficiency benefits of an integrated solution
7975555 while most companies use a source code management application few integrate it with their issue management tool to create a complete change management solution
7975556 we recognized this was going to be a large task with extraordinary requirements and we needed to find a partner that could provide the migration and transition expertise as well as the it competencies to effectively manage our environment and make it all happen in record time
7975557 acxioms depth of knowledge in the mainframe arena and their ability to provide the entire spectrum of it services required for this project made them the frontrunner in our selection process
7975558 we appreciate the trust ssab placed in acxiom a transition of this magnitude typically requires a longer time frame the ssab team members are true professionals and really made this high risk effort work it has been my belief that clients who need high stakes agility from an it provider should consider acxiom first it was satisfying to validate that assumption with results
7975559 acxiom has proven itself to be an integral extension of our it team by showing us they have the tools technologies and expertise to deliver operational excellence
7975560 we distinguish ourselves by the best in class solutions and productivity that allow our customers to stay competitive acxioms robust business critical it infrastructure services will help us maintain that leadership position for the years to come
7975561 this partnership will provide home builders with a low cost and integrated software solution that will allow them to streamline their business process
7975562 we were able to build a bridge between different technologies without requiring our customers to purchase a third party tool
7975563 our partnership allows our customers to take advantage of todays best technology without trying to reinvent the wheel
7975564 we recognized the strengths in each of our products and realized our customers would be much better off if we worked together
7975565 we try to make everything we do look good as well as taste good
7975566 one of the biggest problems is not getting the food and supplies we ask for its the conditions
7975567 but it would have to be transported on dry ice or in freezers we just dont have those capabilities
7975568 when we cook hamburgers and hot dogs everyone feels like they are at home
7975569 we have the grill going and we bring out chili and chips and it kind of brings us all back to the states
7975570 we are the no 1 morale booster out here when soldiers get excited to eat something we cooked i get excited
7975571 its all about seeing the smiles on their faces when they come to chow
7975572 the iphone application launch has been a tremendous catalyst for growth
7975573 because anyone can use limbo iphone users have triggered viral growth across all carriers mobile phone models and usage platforms
7975574 iphone application users are spurring greater interaction in the mobile community making it a richer and more enjoyable place for all limbo members regardless of how they participate be it through mobile web text commands internet or iphone application
7975575 it is wonderful to be included on the list again and it shows that spadac is successfully evolving and adapting to the changing marketplace to maintain its status as a top provider of geospatial solutions
7975576 i believe it is spadacs drive for innovation and ability to create geo enhanced analysis and imagery products that can be applied to a variety of situations and markets that have allowed the company to continue its growth trend
7975577 if you want to find out which companies are going to change the world look at the inc 500

7975579 boundary scan is an excellent example of how the efforts of a cross industry group can benefit all of the electronics industry
7975580 if we can generate greater support for boundary scan among electronic design automation eda tools suppliers and chip makers many of the downstream electronics companies such as circuit board makers and systems providers stand to benefit greatly because their products will improve in quality their test procedures will be more comprehensive and less costly
7975581 since its development in the 1990s adoption of boundary scan has benefited the industry greatly we want to expand upon this base and take it up to another level
7975582 we feel that the boundary scan ecosystem is not yet complete and we want to do what we can to ensure this technology can be applied effectively in design validation test and debug applications for chips circuit boards and systems this will pave the way for other standards that support methodologies for more complex embedded instruments such as the internal jtag ijtag ieee p1687 standard that is currently being developed
7975583 vail real estate buyers see the pace at which inventory is diminishing and are responding more quickly were still experiencing strong demand from both domestic and international marketplaces
7975584 about 19 percent of our buyers have come from outside the u s and inquiries from these areas are growing
7975585 as baby boomers search for retirement opportunities were seeing a greater interest in new more flexible and lower maintenance vacation property
7975586 offshore document review has the ability to level the playing field by saving companies considerable costs associated with litigation boutique and mid sized law firms are able to offer more services to their clients by working with an outsourced offshore document review firm this new generation of legal services is poised to dramatically impact the legal industry
7975587 as sited in the aba opinion security and highly skilled lawyers are key to moving document review offshore as a firm weve engineered processes and implemented robust technology to create a strong offering to leading companies and law firms
7975588 there are many things to consider when it comes to the newly issued regulations for the fact act red flag rules
7975589 it is important for financial institutions to obtain information and solutions from a trusted source to help them prepare for and comply with the fact act red flags requirements wolters kluwer financial services suite of solutions is certainly a trusted source that we recommend to our member banks
7975590 since regulators issued the red flag rules bankers have been bombarded with solicitations from an endless number of companies promoting their compliance services
7975591 many of these companies have only recently entered the compliance business bankers should choose a time tested proven compliance expert to make certain they are prepared for the november 1 implementation deadline that is why cbsc selected the wolters kluwer financial services red flag rules solutions for cbai member banks
7975592 the fact that leading industry banking associations are teaming up with us for red flags compliance illustrates the importance of meeting the new regulatory requirements
7975593 it also demonstrates the trust and assurance by these organizations and their members that wolters kluwer financial services can help them do so quickly effectively and efficiently
7975594 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7975595 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7975596 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7975597 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7975598 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7975599 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7975600 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7975601 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7975602 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7975603 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7975604 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7975605 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7975606 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7975607 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7975608 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7975609 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7975610 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7975611 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7975612 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7975613 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7975614 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7975615 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7975616 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7975617 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7975618 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7975619 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7975620 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7975621 we prefer to have iroa involvement in all of our operations especially when we have such close and constant interaction with the local populace as we did during operation diablo dragnet
7975622 fortunately we had the assistance of the national security directorate to facilitate our search
7975623 after the town was deemed cleared several mini shuras were held with local elders
7975624 they came with a look of uncertainty in their eyes but after meeting with the professional paratroopers and mohammad zarif they left with smiles on their faces
7975625 the new afghan government and isaf forces are here to support the afghan people
7975626 zarif was a great help in communicating our intent to the people of maku and in facilitating a security shura with the village elders
7975627 he was very knowledgeable about security in the maiwand area and a direct link between the local populace isaf and iroa
7975628 its pretty clear that the future of afghanistan rests solely on the shoulders of the afghans
7975629 we were initially skeptical of having the nsd representative with us on our operation but he turned out to be a real asset almost immediately
7975630 since the beginning of time waterways have been an excellent way to transport items
7975631 but were here to deny that use to anti iraqi forces and open the waterways for legitimate business
7975632 were motivated to be here and every time we find a weapons cache or an ied its exciting
7975633 the three guys we detained were suspects in an incident which killed six marines and when we caught them our motivation just skyrocketed
7975634 in a way were allowing the marines to focus on their mission elsewhere
7975635 and we put the navy back into the fight were doing a job that hasnt been done since vietnam

7975862 this suggests its not a comet because a comet would not be as large as the one weve observed and a comet would probably have moved

7975895 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
7975896 the united states should call for a meeting of the united nations security council to condemn russias decision in coordination with our european allies the u s should lead within the un and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions the osce must also send a serious monitoring group to georgia
7975897 russias government must respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and other independent states its refusal to do so calls into question its commitment to the responsibilities of membership to organizations such as the ocse and the russia nato council its application to join the wto and the oecd and makes it impossible for congress to enact the civil nuclear agreement if russias government continues to violate the norms and practices of the international community the united states and our allies must review all aspects of relations with russia
7975898 let us be clear no one wants to see another cold war with russia the united states and russia have many mutual interests and russia has the potential to become a critical stakeholder in the international system but russias recent choices not american or european decisions are threatening this potential and reminding us all that peace and security in europe cannot be taken for granted

7975903 on the basis of historical and recent performance versus the peer group and the healthcare it index as a whole and in light of the largely positive analyst outlook for the company we conclude change is not warranted from a performance perspective
7975904 as the dissidents have neither demonstrated that the replacement of the current board is warranted nor that the opposition slate is better qualified to oversee the company let alone voiced a new or compelling different strategy for the company we believe shareholders would be better served by re electing the management slate of directors who have delivered the superior results of the past five years
7975905 we are extremely pleased that the countrys three leading independent proxy advisory firms have recognized the strengths of our board nominees who possess a keen understanding of the company and understand our strategy to continue building shareholder value under the guidance of our current board nominees the company has implemented a strategic plan that is generating strong returns for our shareholders in our recent quarterly earnings announcement net revenues jumped 31 and our board approved a 20 dividend increase which we believe are indisputable signs of our boards success we believe the most effective way to continue this momentum is to elect the entire quality systems board slate and to reject the independent director proposal
7975906 although we are disappointed with riskmetrics decision on the bylaw proposal which we believe ignores the risk associated with the potential change in the companys bylaws and the real agenda inherent in the proposal we understand they have written guidelines that they had to abide by

7975977 the popularity of other apple products particularly the ipod has drawn more users to the apple platform said charles smulders gartner s managing vice president client computing
7975978 what is quantified is apple s growth in the last two years in the home and small business areas with sales of its imac desktop computers and macbook and macbook pro laptops
7975979 if you look at just the u s home market apple had a 10 4 percent share at the end of the first quarter of this year compared to 7 5 percent for the first quarter of 2007 and 5 4 percent for the first quarter of 2006 smulders said

7976237 this is the era of the civil rights sexual and consciousness expansion revolutions and those are the banners under which the fugs are going to present themselves to america
7976238 i wanted to call the band the yodelling socialists but in the end we settled for the fugs a euphemism for fuck used by norman mailer in his novel the naked and the dead
7976239 greek plays the poetry of the beats charlie parkers seething sax the songs of the civil rights movement early stax and most of all the burgeoning folk rock scene
7976240 the fugs are considered to be beatniks and free thinkers ie free love free use of narcotics it is recommended that this case be placed in a closed status since their recordings are not considered to be obscene
7976241 however much we partied and shouted our poetry we couldnt get the vietnam war out of our minds
7976242 someone came up with the idea of holding an exorcism of this
7976243 i rented a flatbed truck and sound system the band climbed on board
7976244 we walked onto the lawn in front of the pentagon where lines of armed soldiers with rifles thrust forward stood guarding the entranceway we were carrying dozens of white daises we shoved some stems into their rifle barrels that image was broadcast around the world
7976245 i stood on that demonstration chanting along with everyone else the whole world is watching the whole world is watching
7976246 even from a young age i was something youre not meant to be in the us a socialist i think it is time for another big surge like the late 1960s i want to see an end to world poverty health care for all and an end to war
7976247 it is difficult to get the news from poems yet men die miserably every day for lack of what is found there
7976248 the state of the world calls out for poetry to save it
7976249 dont cater to the middle mind of america nor to consumer society
7976250 dig folksingers who are the true singing poets of yesterday and today
7976251 life lived with poetry in mind is itself an art
7976252 it is a pulsing fragment of the inner life an un tethered music
7976253 no not at all im not tired of talking period
7976254 when you get to my age man you look for people to talk to
7976255 i never worried about it when i was in jail because i didnt do anything wrong

7976257 some of my biggest heroes in the entertainment business smoke pot im in good company
7976258 there was a big ego problem and then cheech grew up
7976259 before that i was like the boss and cheech came into his own and wanted to drive the bus the only problem was my bus goes one way and theres one driver
7976260 i love victoria i just love the old people there
7976261 people say you go to victoria to die but those f ers there they dont die they just hobble around forever man
7976262 but we spend an awful lot of our twenties defining ourselves with our jobs with our relationships when we reach 27 weve been trying so hard to reach certain goals fame money success that we might suddenly realise for the first time that were not that happy after all and we are supposed to be grown up and responsible and we dont feel ready
7976263 but you also need to be what americans refer to as a heritage artist
7976264 someone whos made a real difference to rocknroll hendrix joplin the doors nirvana the stones these are all bands and individuals whose music was truly great and they never got to finish who knows what they would have gone on to produce if they were alive today
7976265 i took this in a park in madrid kurt had no energy no interest in anything it was funny because dave grohl and krist novoselic were the nicest guys you could ever hope to meet but kurt just seemed frustrated courtney love his wife had come to meet him on tour and she loved being the centre of attention it was a nightmare to take the picture i had to wait around for hours and the pr kept ringing up to say kurt and courtney were still holed up in their hotel room id spent days on the road with nirvana in the us when the first album came out in 1989 back then kurt had been much more engaging none of them was doing drugs as much i guess he became disenchanted with the music industry the tours all the promotional stuff he just wanted to be in a little punk rock band
7976266 the rolling stones were the first big band i ever photographed this is the first time they were on television in july 1963 when they were plugging their first record i was 22 and had been working for tatler taking pictures of debutantes which i was delighted to be away from brian had his little gang of groupies and hes signing autographs for them here in those days when they were building the group they were nice to everybody we used to go out after gigs and id buy them chickens from the barbecue on the kings road as there wasnt any mcdonalds back then it was only later that they really started doing drugs i reckoned brian only did them because he was miserable with what was going on in the group he was the leader really but there was so much infighting to get rid of him particularly from mick and keith without him though the stones would never have existed
7976267 in this picture janis is reading a comic on the plane to a gig in detroit she didnt always read comics though she was very literate she was one of the few performers i got to know personally while i was photographing in new york i found her to be loving considerate and lonely she seemed to experience pain even when she was having pleasure that she couldnt get as high in real life as she did from her performances saddened and depressed her one night after a big show in new york i shared a cab with her and a few other members of the band she directed the cab to drive to the home of a casual friend who she hoped was there when she got out she shook her head and with a sad smile said man what a drag here i am a big star and i cant find anyone to be with
7976268 i was part of a movement to stop a war then and im part of a movement to stop a war now
7976269 in that very special case it was our youthful defiance that ruled the day
7976270 for rebellion to mean anything it must be useful so join us in the spirit of justice and peace
7976271 ammtec still firmly believes in the psi resin technology but considerable effort and working capital is still required as psi continues development of the resins and focuses on marketing the product whereas the resin business is aligned to some extent to ammtec and metallurgical testing isrequired to sure up the ion exchange processes it is not core to our operations psi will need resources and funding to further commercialise the resin technology and this would have been detrimental to our eps
7976272 even though resin technology is very well established in other sectors its use in metallurgical processing is very new and therefore may require considerable financial commitment over an extended period to fully realise its commercial potential
7976273 the reason we werent terrorists is that we did not commit random acts of terror against people
7976274 the only thing bill didnt take into consideration in making his bomb
7976275 was the fact that these wicks those fuses on those firecrackers are waterproof with heavy paraffin and a cigarette burning by itself does not always have enough heat to melt that paraffin and light the powder and i didnt volunteer any information to the contrary
7976276 wondered whether there might be a speck of truth in the cautions of his liberal and socialist friends
7976277 hopeless m lange somehow firmed of pacifism and closet communism
7976278 the hawks were smug and self righteous the doves were evasive of the real question
7976279 small town with 70 000 residents and a police force of 254
7976280 emerge as a city of importance recognized as such throughout the world
7976281 supported selective arrests in displaying police authority he preferred the arrests to be timed and placed so as not to ignite further disorder a philosophy emerged to move slowly to avoid mass arrests and seek nonconfrontational approaches
7976282 nos complica creo que hoy d a hay ciertos antecedentes que son bien dif ciles de manejar y esperamos que la canciller a solicite las informaciones y nos entregue lo que esperamos recibir
7976283 los acad micos que apoyaron mi candidatura porque de alguna manera nos vemos representados en t rminos de hacer un trabajo historiogr fico que no s lo significa traer situaciones del pasado sino que tambi n nuestras preocupaciones presentes para tratar de lograr una sociedad m s feliz justa y equilibrada

7976285 esa es una apreciaci n de un piloto activo del servicio a reo nacional san no debemos buscar una relaci n de causalidad con el hecho que ocurri y lo que se pudo haber emitido en su momento
7976286 las investigaciones que se hicieron contemplan que era un aparato que ten a m s de 30 a os pero que por los protocolos y obligaciones que tiene el servicio a reo nacional y los procedimientos normales de aeron utica civil era sometido constantemente a mantenimiento
7976287 como piloto de experiencia recomiendo que no se utilice este helic ptero para reservas vip y mucho menos reservas presidenciales por la antig edad que el mismo posee
7976288 el manejo inadecuado del piloto de los procedimientos de emergencias por la falla del motor no 1
7976289 so thats just going to have to remain a mystery for all those dylanologists
7976290 my reflex action was to say thank you very much but no it had been so many years that id shut the door but the way he presented it was what was it like as a young girl to come from the family i came from and end up in the village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes that was something to think about then my son said people have been writing a version of you for years its time you told the real one it suddenly made sense
7976291 when he started out as a performer he was playful a combination of woody guthrie and harpo marx with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient
7976292 he used that playfulness to draw the audience in with the passing of time the technique was no longer required the audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage a sense of humour however was always his strong suit
7976293 right from the start i couldnt take my eyes off her
7976294 she was the most erotic thing id ever seen she was fair skinned and golden haired full blood italian we started talking and my head started to spin she was just my type
7976295 situations have ended sad relationships have all been bad mineve been like verlaines and rimbaud
7976296 i felt i was reading a book of revelations lessons warnings
7976297 even though picasso was a much older man than bob and had experienced a lot more their personalities were so similar that it was astounding
7976298 he sat still and quiet didnt even jiggle his leg
7976299 i can recognise things its like looking at a diary it brings it all back and whats hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go his mine anybodys so from the perspective of an older person looking back you enjoy them but also think of them as the pain of youth the loneliness and the struggle that youth is or may be
7976300 i could see that he was an artist at work
7976301 i was a young girl of my time i was shy and timid and i would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do if a girl did that it would mean that she was alone she wasnt with somebody she was an easy woman it would take a lot of courage to do it and when you did it you took a chance
7976302 he had this intensity about him and you got sucked in
7976303 there are people who say that he was not a good guy he was manipulative he was this that and the other i tend to see it as you are what you are he could be a shit like anybody else but a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted because nobody was in a position to tell you no everybodys yessing you and everybody wants a piece of you so what do you do
7976304 and there are no residual hurt feelings i think shes an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it and to everybody else the hell with you which men could do easily she went out and got what she wanted and then he in turn did it for her and then he didnt that was him going after what he wanted with no baggage he never looked back he just kept going
7976305 it was the hardest thing to write about i was young and vulnerable and insecure there were pressures from all around and i couldnt find my place any more i didnt feel i had anybody i could turn to that makes you really fall apart and thats how i felt
7976306 only four people in new york know what that means he makes guitars
7976307 but its true so it doesnt go from page to page but the emotion that i managed to find is true
7976308 were making out hard core while waiting in line for margaritas
7976309 they were holding hands and were all over each other
7976310 the kind of ugly than could peel the stink off a monkey
7976311 has become the united states no 1 latin american ally in its war on terrorism and drugs
7976312 what about the vast majority of women who are the lifeblood of our society nurses schoolteachers bus drivers single parent mothers who dont have that structure
7976313 is there a way that we can invest differently in this country to bring more support and attention to the issues that are basically strangling the family unit
7976314 we dont have the money or the resources to spend on improving the environment we have more pressing problems
7976315 from a financial point of view the cost to improve the environment is a direct cost but the benefits are indirect
7976316 people dont consider the environment in their future because the benefits are intangible in the long term
7976317 the people working in garbage are not working because it is environmental work
7976318 they just want to earn money and have no other way to do it
7976319 we try to link income with education without destroying the boys schedules because they have to help collect the garbage
7976320 in order to help abolish mathematical illiteracy we make the boys calculate the amount of bottles they collect and multiply them by the amount of money they receive
7976321 after calculating it in his mind the student uses a spreadsheet to help him learn to use the computer
7976322 we try to save the water because we never know when it will be working last week there was no water for three days
7976323 it is very important for the people here to have hot water to wash their clothes and hands because the garbage is dirty and filled with diseases
7976324 the students at recycling school start to know things about the environment about life about being green and they start to talk to their families and communities about it
7976325 we need to show the egyptian government that we can do things with this community
7976326 people who work and live in poor areas often deal with the environment better than wealthy people
7976327 their consumption levels are a lot lower and they are more in touch with nature they reuse everything because they cannot afford to have a high level of consumption
7976328 to start waste segregation for recycling at the source we need time to change mindsets raise awareness and educate people at the grassroots level
7976329 there is recycling in this country but it is very piecemeal at the moment
7976330 it seems that actually persuading someone to put their rubbish in a bin out here is quite an achievement let alone having them put it in a special container
7976331 within a generation qatar has moved from a society that was rural to industrial to environmentally aware
7976332 now there is the supreme council for the environment and natural reserves scenr obviously theres a long way to go but theyve achieved a great deal in the 12 or so years theyve been at it
7976333 the advantage of qatar and other oil producing countries in the region is that they are looking at the expansion of their development and economy from the start they have the luxury to avoid mistakes made in the past by other countries
7976334 weve lost some environments and some ecosystems but weve gained others if youre a palm tree or a reef fish youre going to be very pleased with what weve done
7976335 water is a valuable asset in the gulf so when you go to the toilet and flush that water does not go out to sea
7976336 it goes to the sewage treatment plant and is used in our district cooling system for irrigation and to fill ornamental lakes
7976337 we hope to have an on line consumption meter so that people can compare their electricity and water usage and set their own environmental and financial improvement targets
7976338 we will provide all kinds of information about how people can be environmentally friendly while living on the island
7976339 taxi drivers are finding natural gas to be an interesting option because it costs 30 percent of what they pay for petrol
7976340 this is good for drivers from a financial point of view because the difference in price can make up for the cost of converting their cars
7976341 some of my driver friends have found that using natural gas is a good way to save money but for me petrol is much more convenient
7976342 when i have children i want them to do environmental work i want them to do new things everyday to help people understand that they can change their own lives
7976343 ive see dramatic changes in the approach that this country is taking in environmental management
7976344 with wealth has come information and knowledge and there has been a substantial increase in environmental consciousness among the society
7976345 she the leader of the service said these are all people of faith im not a person of faith she doesnt speak for me
7976346 the democratic party is supposed to be a party of all the people and youre holding a religious service for people of faith you go to a democratic function and they tell you youre a person of faith well im not a person of faith i believe in the constitution
7976347 you obviously dont care about roe v wade or a womens right to choose or replacing stevens and ginsburg with more scalias and thomas you cant really care about our health care system and you must prefer tax cuts for the wealthiest americans as opposed to financially helping the middle class

7976352 he is funny very funny laugh this is the first time to play a manga character in my career comic and movie is different so i hope you will like my acting
7976353 the script was very well written i didnt worry about it character is very fascinating and dramatic the important thing for an actor is not money or work but whether the character is fascinating or not
7976354 he and i love ladies but my wife is always around me so i cant be looking at ladies so much
7976355 i think he is handsomer than the manga character im sure that the fans of the original manga will love him and you guys what did you think when you heard i would play master roshi
7976356 who do you think suits the role of master roshi
7976357 cheers i will treat you to dinner later anyway the movie is an adventure following the original manga and animation thank you for your support
7976358 i think he is wonderful he acts the change of goku growing up gradually very well he as well as us was researching quite a lot to be able to play goku properly

7976372 the opportunity provided by the macarthur foundation to partner with the institute of play is something that ultimately will have a huge impact on how k 12 schoolteachers and students collaborate in the classroom
7976373 smallab gets students and teachers up out of their seats and has the potential to reshape learning in the 21st century classroom
7976374 in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive world it is important that we provide our students with the best possible professional preparation and employment opportunities
7976375 it is paramount that we match our high caliber students with an extensive range of professional options with the appointment of kitty mcgrath to executive director of career services we intend to do just that by supporting academic units and broadening the reach and scope of career services
7976376 with the high quality of education our students receive they are invaluable to employers in arizona the united states and across the globe
7976377 how could the author make such a genuine real character
7976378 the field internship experience provides you an opportunity to put into practice the lessons learned in the classroom most students report that their greatest learning experiences occurred during their internship

7976384 client contact in working with clients from very different cultures than my own i had to learn and im still learning to walk the fine line between respecting their cultural values and maintaining a degree of professionalism as a social worker
7976385 the internship gives you the chance to put all youve learned into action and also to begin to understand and develop your own particular way of practicing social work

7976424 has a false fake birth certificate posted on their website
7976425 factchecker org sic says it obtained obamas actual birth certificate and that the document was indeed real
7976426 a separate wnd investigation into obamas birth certificate utilizing forgery experts also found the document to be authentic
7976427 discredited some of the claims of internet bloggers such as that the certificate as viewed in a scanned copy released by obamas campaign lacked a raised seal
7976428 revealed methods used by some of the bloggers to determine the document was fake involved forgeries in that a few bloggers added text and images to the certificate scan that werent originally there
7976429 charge leaped from the blogosphere to the mainstream media earlier this week when jerome corsi repeated the claim in an aug 15 interview with steve doocy on fox news
7976430 israel insider is reporting that analysts working separately have determined the birth certificate posted on the daily kos website and later on sen barack obamas fight the smears campaign website is fraudulent and now two different actions have been launched to try and obtain the truth about the presumptive democratic presidential nominees birth

7976477 we are lucky enough to have a genius in our ranks
7976478 he was a good player but not an exceptional one
7976479 technically he was excellent but he wasnt a player who would win you games he doesnt have great physical qualities even when he goes by a man hes quite easily caught he never manages to be a match winner i had to play him further back in the midfield because of that weakness an attacker in my team has to be productive there must be an end product
7976480 everything is going well and a deal can be reached
7976481 the differences we have are ones we can solve and in the next two or three days there has to be a solution because there is no more time
7976482 darren was outstanding in pre season and has carried that form on
7976483 it is great that players are posing problems now for the manager when everyone is fit
7976484 they are putting in performances that demand they are on the bench if not starting i am sure the manager will be happy about that
7976485 you cant ask for any more from a team than to take six points from their first two games of the season and that is exactly what liverpool have done
7976486 sunderland and middlesbrough are going to give a lot of teams problems this season but despite being nowhere near their best liverpool have somehow managed to come up with a way to beat both of them
7976487 in this respect you cant ask any more of rafa benitez and his players they have done just what we all hoped they would do in terms of getting off to a good start
7976488 but there is no doubt they are going to have to improve if their winning run is going to continue because their opening two performances have not been of the standard expected
7976489 winning when you are not playing well is something you have to be able to do if you are going to challenge for the title but it isnt something that can be sustained too long
7976490 if youre sloppy in possession and not creating many chances then it is inevitably winning matches is difficult
7976491 thats what happened against middlesbrough on saturday when liverpool didnt get anywhere near hitting the kind of form they are capable of they could so easily have dropped valuable points
7976492 the fact that they didnt though says a lot about the character of the team and im sure thats one of the big plus points that benitez is taking from the game
7976493 when things arent going well you need your big game players to pull something out of the bag and thats what jamie carragher and steven gerrard did
7976494 when things arent going well it can sometimes be easy to just accept that it isnt going to be your day but thats never going to be the case with players like carragher and gerrard
7976495 in taking the initiative they led by example and it was thanks to their interventions towards the end of the game that liverpool were able to come away with three points they might otherwise have missed out on
7976496 the concern is that liverpool cannot continue to rely so heavily on their captain and vice captain and other players are going to have to start chipping in if the good start to the season is to be maintained
7976497 i know the fans will be concerned about liverpools current form but the most important thing at this stage is to get points on the board
7976498 if you do that then it breeds confidence and it sends out a message to the rest of the league that you are going to be hard to beat
7976499 but liverpool need to get better and i believe that they will especially if benitez can add a bit of width to his side before the transfer window closes
7976500 there were welcome signs against middlesbrough that fernando torres is beginning to strike up an understanding with new strike partner robbie keane
7976501 you could see that they were starting to get used to each others movement and were picking up their running off the ball
7976502 there was one moment in the first half when keane went on a little run and picked torres out with a perfect pass with the outside of his right foot
7976503 torres wasnt able to take the chance on this occasion but at least it showed that they are getting to know one another better and that bodes well for the future
7976504 if these two hit it off and ive got no reason to doubt that they will then it will really benefit the team as a whole and im sure theyre both working really hard to make it happen
7976505 anyone who saw the first leg of liverpools champions league qualifier against standard liege a fortnight ago will know the belgians are no pushovers
7976506 standard are the champions of their country and that means they deserve respect especially after the way they performed against the reds in liege
7976507 had it not been for pepe reinas heroics then standard would be coming to anfield tomorrow night with a lead to protect and that would definitely have made the tie even more difficult than it already is for rafa benitezs men
7976508 as things stand liverpool do not have an away goal to fall back on so they will be looking to keep a clean sheet otherwise things could get very tricky
7976509 obviously liverpool are big favourites to go through but they cannot take anything for granted because if they do standard might just take advantage
7976510 importantly though liverpool have encountered this kind of situation so many times in europe in recent seasons so they know exactly what they have to do and how to go about it
7976511 i wouldnt be at all surprised if it is a tight affair because standard looked a well organised and decent side in the first leg but liverpool should have enough know how and experience to get through
7976512 no because andrei is still with zenit and i am still not sure if he is going away

7976538 it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
7976539 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through
7976540 nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying
7976541 i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard
7976542 but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
7976543 i am not a hero for the penalty in the first match
7976544 i have just done my job for me the penalty was just a part of it
7976545 you can see the squad is now starting to look stronger with the return of ryan javier and lucas the manager has a lot more options now
7976546 there is still some time in the transfer window and i think in that time you will start to see our squad get to full strength
7976547 i think there will be another arrival before the deadline
7976548 the managers obviously got his eye on two or three different players and i think it would help us if another new face came in
7976549 sometimes you need the kick up the backside similar to the one we had against liege you dont want to go into the season a little bit complacent and no one could argue against the fact liege were the better team on the night
7976550 it was certainly a wake up call for us and the best thing about it was that we didnt get beat
7976551 were still in the tie and know that at anfield we will play a lot better liege will also find it more difficult
7976552 last season we only lost once at home but had too many draws which isnt good enough
7976553 we have got maximum points from our two games and still havent played anywhere near the level we are capable of we know we can improve but we kept going until the end against middlesbrough and showed great character
7976554 we get a guaranteed signing on fee and each year we have a guaranteed revenue stream
7976555 the race series the drivers the tracks all of that is covered by the race organisers and the series organisers
7976556 were hopefully supporting the series and hopefully bringing some of our sponsors along to support it but we have no financial burden
7976557 were taking it very seriously but unfortunately the on track performance is largely in the hands of the driver and the team
7976558 weve got a professional race team and weve got a great driver so were very excited and are expecting results
7976559 its been great when we are out there talking to potential partners in all sorts of categories liverpool football club just opens doors and that makes life a whole lot easier
7976560 you can see the impact in training they have a really good mentality and they are really happy especially mascherano and lucas because of their medals i think it will be positive for the team
7976561 if everything is okay maybe they could play this weekend they will be around and we will decide but they cannot play in the champions league
7976562 theyre not playing this game so they have time in training and theyll be okay
7976563 everyone knows what a good professional he is he is a nice boy and a good player so everyone is pleased for him its amazing
7976564 they could be the best team weve faced if you look at some of the other games we were much better than the opposition
7976565 but if we do the right things we can be on top of them at anfield we will try to play at a high tempo and im sure theyll try to play on the counter attack i think it will be more or less similar to the first game but the difference will be anfield
7976566 we have to improve at everything set pieces and open play we had a bad game the best thing was the result but this time we have to play better and we have to score goals
7976567 you can know a team but sometimes you dont know exactly how they will play until you get on the pitch you can watch videos and things like that but you do not always know now we know a lot about them so it will be easier to not make any mistakes
7976568 but i wasnt surprised by them i was surprised at how badly we played
7976569 we have a lot of confidence that we will go through we are at anfield and we have to improve and we will improve
7976570 we have training tomorrow and then well decide on the one or two players who have had problems
7976571 if you ask me if i am considering this option the answer is no i am just thinking about winning
7976572 i dont think so i think we have better options but if were desperate we can send anyone up there we can send pepe reina if necessary

7976589 yes friend there is a special reason for bringing them to qandahar and ordinary people are not aware of it when the battle between afghans and soviets started a strong wave of jihad surged across the whole world and then muslims from around the world started arriving in afghanistan these jihadi sentiments were undoubtedly alarming for us after the fall of soviets we found a way to meet this threat we made them fight against each other and they wasted their energies on each other after sometime we realized that this policy was not very useful then the taliban government stabilized in afghanistan and the jihadis got a new home afghanistan became a base camp for the muslims around the world those training camps of afghanistan which were constructed from our dollars in the time of soviet invasion anti american slogans were being chanted in the same camps during the time of taliban though kabul is the capital and the political and government machinery works there but qandahar is considered to be the centre of afghanistan from the religious perspective qandahar was the center of the movement of taliban and the ancestral city of mulla umar in this city taliban and arab mujahideen used to dream about the domination of islam they used to make plans of american destruction and spreading jihadi ideologies we humiliated the arab mujahideen and taliban in the streets of qandahar to let their eyes which dreamed the destruction of america see that each every inch of qandahar was under our occupation those mosques of qandahar in which they used to pray for the domination of islam and our defeat they are now under the control of the followers of jesus christ the rulers of islamic world are already our slaves but these few crazy muslims were giving us headache we want not only to crush their islamic sentiments we want to kill their conscience we want to crush their bodies and personality we want them to break up psychologically psychologically the best way was to humiliate them by chaining them like animals and treat them like dogs in the buildings of the very same city in which they lived with honor and walked proudly the city which was a symbol of their glory so that they would compare their current life with their past and look at the condition of the city and eventually realize that their dream of making islam supreme is only a deception and also to make them believe that america is undefeatable
7976590 because these people are very staunch and firm in their faith they dont care about anything they are not grieved or saddened they dont even care about losing their government we have imprisoned their bodies but their souls are free humiliating them imprisoning them and making them believe in our strength and glory is impossible for us undoubtedly they are dangerous people such people are very firm in their friendship and enmity they are true and sincere their friendship is towards their religion and allah and they consider every person who is an enemy of quran and their prophet as their enemy
7976591 tell me buddy what should we do should we leave christianity because of these fanatics should we give up the cross to accept the supremacy of islam
7976592 muslims just like i stamped your holy book under my feet like that we are going to stamp all the muslims under our feet is there anyone who can stop me
7976593 o my muslim brothers remember the infidel powers of the world are not scared of your prayers your fasting your ablution your pilgrimage your alms giving or your purity if they are scared of anything then its only jihad o my muslim brothers all the kufr has gathered and united to destroy islam hence you all should forget your internal differences and be united my muslim brothers i have seen the american soldiers closely according to my personal experiences and observations america is an extremely coward nation americas power rule and dominance are in the last of her stages she is a collapsing wall which is going to collapse anytime whichever nation or individual will try to support this wall will eventually get buried under its rubble
7976594 we were scoring lots of goals in pre season and the team was improving it was really pleasing
7976595 i thought we were in a good moment but we didnt play well in our last three games that was clear
7976596 if you are asking me if i am considering defeat then the answer is no
7976597 they were good in the first game but we were really poor if we improve and play at our level it will be difficult for them
7976598 if we are winning games and not playing well it means we should find it easier to win games when we do play well
7976599 but the team wasnt good enough around them but they showed they are playing together much better
7976600 hey county commission give us more money so we can use it to demand more money

7976602 racism lynchings disenfranchisement black codes and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life
7976603 whereas the story of the enslavement and de jure segregation of african americans and the dehumanizing atrocities committed against them should not be purged from or minimized in the telling of american history
7976604 whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization and injustices cannot erase the past but confession of the wrongs committed can speed racial healing and reconciliation and help americans confront the ghosts of their past
7976605 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7976606 we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid
7976607 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black hes got a feisty wife
7976608 barack hes talking down to black people telling n s how to behave
7976609 if you look at folks of color even women theyre more successful in the democratic party than they are in the white uh excuse me in the republican party
7976610 i can plainly see in your eyes that you want to know how do i take advantage of this incredible opportunity how do i make sure new orleans is not overrun with mexicans
7976611 quite simply rep cohen will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept there has been an unofficial congressional white caucus for over 200 years and now its our turn to say who can join the club he does not and cannot meet the membership criteria unless he can change his skin color primarily we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population and we will not allow white america to infringe on those objectives

7976615 we were not good on saturday and we lost the game it is as simple as that
7976616 you cannot want the supporters not to take it to heart because we do we are all very disappointed with our performance
7976617 we completely understand the critics because we were not good but we promise we will come back and play well tomorrow to put a good performance in
7976618 what is impressive for me is attitude and quality the solution is not always to buy there are no names and no news
7976619 we do not have to worry about too many other players i believe in the team i have and in my squad
7976620 it is not one player that makes the difference it is us as a team if we find one more we will bring him in if not we will not limit our ambitions because of that
7976621 i believe strongly that we can win the champions league because of what i see in training and because i believe we have the quality to do it
7976622 senderos has gone to milan today he will complete his medical today
7976623 the thinking is that at the moment he is not getting the games here and goes to a top level club to play
7976624 we have djourou toure senderos song gallas silvestre so there is congestion at centre back with losing him we want him to play
7976625 yo its hard tryna find a path you cant even see its even harder growing up with an abnormal dream tryna strive to be the best artist you can be aint gonna quit still aint settling for lose or defeat life is way too short to just be satisfied im only 25 but wait tomorrow i might die so while i still have time while im still alive i might as well create a dream then i can call it mine
7976626 dimitar berbatov is probably about as welcome in the spurs dressing room right now as i would be on the terraces at white hart lane
7976627 but at least i have respect for tottenham berbatovs attitude stinks
7976628 he is showing no respect towards the guys who are bothered to turn out on saturday and work hard and he is treating the club with disdain
7976629 if i were a tottenham player i would not be able to speak to berbatov at the moment
7976630 being not ready to play against sunderland at the weekend is putting it mildly
7976631 it seems like berbatov doesnt care how his behaviour is affecting everyone else at the club
7976632 berbatov is one of the best strikers in the premier league but he doesnt want to play for spurs any more and is being disruptive
7976633 tottenham have lost the first two games of the season no coincidence is it this mess is not doing them any favours and already it is looking like being a game of catch up just to qualify for the uefa cup
7976634 and that is just over a week into a season when some supporters and many pundits thought spurs would be a serious threat to the top four

7976637 no lo pod a creer pero cuando baj all supe que era mi gata porque cada uno tiene su propia voz
7976638 i think weve seen in the last few seasons we can beat anybody so you have to be positive you have to believe that you can do it again at least make it to the final
7976639 ive played a few finals now and you can see that anything can happen you can play well you can play not well you can win and lose certainly you have to make it there i think we have the quality and experience to do it and we are looking forward to it
7976640 i think maybe because it was the one that we played better and the one we showed more desire we were all devastated after that final but i must say after that game we realised that arsenal was a big club and we could compete against anyone
7976641 we were playing the final against barcelona with one player less in the first five or 10 minutes they didnt come back until the last 10 minutes so it was really impressive and we were devastated but at the same time we felt proud for the fans and for ourselves because what we did was quite amazing
7976642 weve got to attack the cups as has anyone outside the top four because we know its going to be won by a premier league side
7976643 its also a route into europe and last year we got to the quarter finals and got done in the last minute by everton so who knows what could have happened
7976644 ive always attacked the cups and also coming after the weekends defeat its another game for us to get out there
7976645 im not going to change too much of the team that played at man city
7976646 im pleased weve got a home draw so im looking forward to getting back out there winning a game and then looking towards the weekend
7976647 hes been in full training but his problem was that he got himself back and then he was ill for three weeks and couldnt shake it off
7976648 hes overcoming that at the moment so the injury is ok but he hasnt played a pre season game
7976649 well have to see if he gets any football on wednesday night or saturday but i think its more likely to be on wednesday
7976650 people forget jon spector played 20 odd games last season and the last thing we could have done with was having george out and jon out at the same time
7976651 thats resulted in lucas neill having to play at left back
7976652 well get george back and it will give us a bit of pace down that side

7976654 we need common principles to find a fair solution to these problems for the benefit of all people living in conflict stricken territories if people believe that kosovo can be granted full independence why then should we deny it to abkhazia and south ossetia
7976655 i am not speaking about how russia will act however we know that turkey for instance has recognized the republic of northern cyprus
7976656 i do not want to say that russia will immediately recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states but such precedent does exist

7976711 entre los laboratorios hay algunos que hacen promoci n con los m dicos otros que hacen en medios de comunicaci n y otros que lo hacen en el canal de distribuci n esos son los que vienen a las farmacias y nos ofrecen un mayor margen de ganancias
7976712 nuestra pol tica al respecto es clara no se cambian las recetas y si detectamos que eso ocurre aplicaremos las sanciones pertinentes
7976713 porque los productos son farmac uticamente equivalentes y est n aprobados por el isp
7976714 en este momento no es posible que una farmacia diga que este medicamento es equivalente a este otro de eso no hay ninguna certificaci n
7976715 hoy el isp lo que certifica es la seguridad calidad y eficacia de un medicamento podemos asegurar que cada uno tiene el principio activo en la cantidad que dice tener pero no que sea igual al de otro laboratorio por eso no pueden ser reemplazados
7976716 no es lo mismo vender un producto similar pero de distinto laboratorio porque la gran mayor a de los medicamentos en chile son copia y no hay estudios para decir que uno es igual al otro son similares pero su eficacia no es la misma
7976717 aunque sea la misma droga puede producir efectos severos en el paciente porque no hay bioequivalencia comprobada
7976718 no pueden reemplazar el tratamiento porque no pueden comprobar que son iguales
7976719 cada vez que se vulnera la receta del m dico se pone potencialmente en riesgo la salud de los pacientes y puede resultar m s caro por las consecuencias

7976739 supporters who join the scheme will earn points to secure tickets for future games and when ticket allocations are low theyll be allocated to the supporters with the most points
7976740 a point will be allocated each time a supporter applies to purchase a ticket so even if unsuccessful as a result of a small overall allocation of tickets the fan will still earn a point towards a future game
7976741 introducing a points system will also allow the club to more accurately advise supporters in advance of booking travel who is most likely to qualify to receive tickets
7976742 this new method of european ticket distribution has been introduced following consultation with fans and supporter groups and the general consensus at those meetings was this was the correct way to move forward
7976743 the scheme will also allow the club and its travel partner thomas cook to process applications much more efficiently enabling our supporters to have more time to plan their travel and accommodation and or book time off work

7976750 south africa are attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defenses you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
7976751 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organization and discipline
7976752 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach

7976782 caranya dana apbd dipindahkan ke rekening pribadi pns di daerah bersangkutan setelah itu uangnya dipakai untuk kepentingan pribadi dana itu akan tercampur dengan dana pribadi sehingga akan sulit dipertanggungjawabkan

7976824 they say its not the crime its the cover up well here it is the crime coleman donors whose money he refuses to return have been convicted of bribing public officials and ted stevens whose money coleman also refuses to return and who paid for colemans luxury fishing trips to alaska has been indicted after accepting improper gifts but now coleman is adding the cover up lying to a constituent about his role in the affair its time for norm coleman to come clean about his fishy relationships with special interests and its time for a change in washington
7976825 for years bill allen was a supporter of two alaskan charities with ties to the states senior senator ted stevens and his former republican colleague frank murkowski the charities have spent millions on lavish fishing tournaments bringing washington bigwigs to alaska to catch salmon and mingle with executives and lobbyists
7976826 the experience of norm coleman shows this process in action and the risks of these relationships in the summer of 2002 stevens and allen worked together to pump more than 100 000 into hard fought senate races coleman in minnesota got close to 25 000 from stevens including a bundle of contributions from alaskans dominated by allens company
7976827 yesterday republican sen norm colemans campaign said the senator wouldnt immediately return campaign cash from indicted republican sen ted stevens today hes changed his mind
7976828 he would give away 20 000 in campaign contributions because they came from a political action committee tied to indicted alaska sen ted stevens
7976829 but that money has been spent already in a past election cycle said coleman spokesman mark drake
7976830 colemans office said his campaign books were closed and the money was already spent
7976831 coleman won and a few months later stevens invited him to alaska for a fishing trip coleman took his son and returned for three straight years cultivating a close relationship with stevens who controlled billions in federal spending was an important part of colemans job but accepting these free trips carried a risk says merideth megehee at the campaign legal center federal election law allowed political committees to pay for colemans flights to alaska senate ethics rules let him accept free flights from anchorage to the fishing tournament and to stay free at a private riverside home federal law however does require political committees that pay for such trips to register with the federal elections commission the committee stevens allies set up to pay for colemans first trip to alaska didnt and that may be a violation of campaign finance laws according to a former fec general counsel and other experts

7976838 it is a huge honour for us we are totally looking forward to this only to be there is a dream come true for us
7976839 when we started out in 2005 nobody was counting on it that we would once tour in the usa bill tells
7976840 we were hoping for succes and thinking it would be cool to perform in the biggest club of magdeburg the

7976844 mit ihrer ausdauer und dank ihrer hilfe konnte bis zu 100 000 menschen geholfen werden

7976856 one of the biggest things we focused on with virtualization was disaster recovery between disparate locations
7976857 virtualization gave us the availability to recover very quickly from physical to virtual machines and virtual back to physical machines
7976858 weve been able to drop back the number of physical boxes we have and the time we spend maintaining those boxes
7976859 along with that we save on cooling costs by about 1 000 a month thats huge
7976860 we started with hyperv when it was first a release candidate
7976861 vmware comes with a couple of features that hyperv doesnt have vmotion being the main one and memory allocation being the other
7976862 one of the discussions we had waswere those feature sets going to give us enough return for the extra price after looking at those features we decided we could probably forgo them and microsoft has been saying all along they are going to catch up the feature set anyway
7976863 since we have multiple sites if we lose disks at a site we can bring them back up from images stored on the san and hyperv supports replay or snapshot capability
7976864 while vmware does replay phenomenally from our perspective wed like to keep the replay on the san
7976865 hyperv takes a snapshot the same way vmware does if you are using hyperv you can use and recover those snapshots and design your workflow around those snapshots in the same way for both physical and virtual servers

7976883 now that we have proved ourselves on the big stage i am sure better days are ahead with the mounting confidence and reinforced commitment of our boxers well go even better in the coming competitions
7976884 i am pleased to have won the bronze i feel with the support and wishes of all my coaches and others in authority i will be working hard to bring the gold in the next olympics
7976885 i think a medal in wrestling is sure to help all lesser followed disciplines it took me 14 years of hard work to bring an olympic medal but for many other young wrestlers it should take much less time now is the time to get all out and multiply the gains
7976886 we boxers have not been able to catch up on sleep

7976892 just like an approved building plan must clearly indicate the set back area built up area and so on the detailed technical drawings indicating the extent of land and its location according to engineering specifications is essential for any road project
7976893 the maps showing the road alignment submitted by nice and approved by the pwd engineers in the early years of the project were schematic and no detailed drawings were submitted let alone technically verified or approved
7976894 the drawings submitted by nice in 2007 do not contain the extent of land and its location in each survey number
7976895 these drawings are necessary for every such project all confusion and doubts regarding the requirement of land will be cleared if the drawings are submitted the project can then be executed quickly this will also make the process of implementation of the project transparent

7976909 we set out last night to make sure that america knew that michelle obama was going to be the kind of first lady that they could all be proud of and that was a lot like them
7976910 all this stuff about mccain and this hitting back hard enough thats all political blah blah
7976911 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7976912 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7976913 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7976914 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this

7976943 theres a statistic beloved of advocates that global poverty could be eliminated if the richest 200 individuals gave away a mere 4 of their wealth it doesnt matter if its precisely true or not the point it serves to illustrate is that theres enough to go round so why is the focus on economic growth instead of on fixing an economic system which produces such eye watering inequalities

7976951 the john mccain of eight years ago knew what was wrong with american politics he was willing to reach across the aisle to get things like campaign finance reform action on global warming etc done he recognized that handing out huge tax cuts to the wealthiest americans at a time in which only the very wealthiest have seen any improvement in their standard of living is madness john mccain say what you will of him was his own man thats why it is so sad that he has capitulated to the very hyper partisan forces that he once stood against eight years ago john mccain and barack obama would not have been standing against one another they would have been standing side by side for reform the story of john mccain is quite simply a tragic one the crushing of a mavericks spirit by the forces of beltway partisanship the forces that turned john mccain into an ally of the very hyper partisanship that characterized the last decade of republican misrule are precisely those that barack obama seeks to finally dislodge from their places of power and privilege

7977076 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
7977077 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7977078 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
7977079 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption

7977092 the two areas highlighted in red are what im interested in the top area shows duct tape the bottom area shows rope suspending hoses which convey hydraulic fluid to and from the pumps not steel but rope i hope those knots are tied tight my guess on the reason those ropes are there two winters ago the corps pulled the pumps to install extended piping on them which moved the previously submerged hose connections out of the water to prevent further rusting of the fittings as captured in the pictures above they probably decided to reuse the same hoses before those hoses ran from the deck above down to fittings which were underwater with the extended piping there was a shorter distance between the pipe on the deck and the new connections on the pumps but they still had the old hoses which were now too long and heavy and they needed to make sure the hoses were not pulling down on the new fittings so they roped them up hardly the best solution and one has to wonder how well the ropes will hold up in extended storm conditions with the pumps running for eight or twelve hours

7977118 we are extremely grateful to the evelyn and walter haas jr fund for generously supporting this important collaboration
7977119 the more than 2 5 million individuals in the 3 100 congregations supported by the institute for welcoming resources and these partner organizations are some of our movements most valuable advocates in promoting understanding reclaiming what unfortunately has become a narrow view of moral values espoused by those who seek to divide and advancing lgbt equality we thank the haas jr fund for not only recognizing this but for providing the critical resources to advance these pro lgbt faith organizing efforts
7977120 we are excited that this grant will help the institute for welcoming resources realize its vision to significantly increase the number of local congregations and parishes committed to the full inclusion of lgbt people
7977121 were convinced that this unique partnership among the task forces iwr program and denominational advocacy organizations holds the potential to transform the larger lgbt movement by greatly expanding its supporters and extending its reach
7977122 a sea change is under way in faith communities across the country
7977123 the day is fast approaching when people will hear the word christian and associate it with justice equality and support for all including lgbt people this collaborative grant is one concrete way were going to get there
7977124 this is the kairos time the opportune time when the church and the world are about to turn while full inclusion of lgbt people in the life of the lutheran communion requires a marathon strategy what we do in the next 12 months will be critical to the success of the mission of lutherans concerned north america over the next 20 years
7977125 the timely and generous grant from the haas jr fund will enable lutherans concerned north america to maximize its strategic impact by increasing organizational and financial capacity enhancing volunteer and leadership development at the grassroots fostering continued expansion of our reconciling in christ program and organizing for the 2009 evangelical lutheran church of america synodical and churchwide assembly seasons where major decisions will be made about the full inclusion of lgbt people and families and pastors
7977126 haas jr was able to see the longtime activism and organizing in frontier territory provided by reconciling ministries network rmn for equality for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons rmn puts these monies to work immediately building infrastructure training new leaders creating networks in new regions and strengthening advocate teams across the united methodist church such strategic investment allows us to impact denominational change from the grassroots to the worldwide legislative sessions of the church
7977127 we are extremely thankful for this grant it will enable us to move to the next level of programming and effectiveness as a faith in action organization this includes developing and implementing a systematic process to help episcopal parishes become more welcoming and affirming of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people in their congregations and communities
7977128 the haas jr fund helps the ucc coalition for lgbt concerns equip volunteers for our mission to educate and advocate for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people and their allies and to save lives by training people in suicide intervention

7977600 these are human beings its our duty to protect the care for them
7977601 i think one of the things that was brought out in these papers is that maybe these warnings arent enough
7977602 maybe the warnings need to be complemented with other things like guidelines
7977603 the rates that those drugs looked like they were increasing was a little bit blunted
7977604 the warnings didnt have i would think the effect that people might have wanted to have seen on the way the drugs are being prescribed
7977605 why do provincial health plans fund the use of these drugs in this population despite three warnings

7977609 the attached print ad part of a series of similar ads run by glaxosmithkline is the most egregious example of this type of advertising this ad is designed to instill fear in the minds of aids patients by telling them that switching aids treatment presumably from gsk drugs may lead to increased side effects and potentially treatment failure this message is gsks response to the increased number of patients switching from its drugs to newer treatments and seeks to discourage aids patients from changing their antiretroviral arv regimens regardless of their medical needs further the explicit message in this ad avoid hidden dangers from switching your hiv medicine is that safety and efficacy information provided by a patients doctor or the fda is incorrect or misleading
7977610 the ads are part of a larger trend of drug companies taking aim at rival hiv drugs hinting at side effects and other drawbacks experts say
7977611 a development fueling the sharp elbows advertising the market for hiv medicines has grown crowded and companies want to protect their market share
7977612 can be deceiving avoid hidden dangers from changing your hiv medicines
7977613 if you are thinking about switching your hiv medicine make sure you know what youre getting into
7977614 with these latest ads gsk has sunk to a new low the company has resorted to exploiting patient fears in order to sell a product while remaining unconcerned about the harm caused to patients who are scared off treatment altogether because of gsks tactics
7977615 we are disappointed that poz magazine a publication targeted to an hiv positive population would run such ads this kind of underhanded negative advertising creates fear of hiv treatment in general which could dissuade people from seeking treatment at all we are also disappointed that despite repeated communication with the fda regarding our concerns over a similar gsk ad campaign last year there appears to be a total lack of oversight of direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs that is why we are appealing to hhs in the hopes that our concerns will be heard and these harmful ads pulled
7977616 unfortunately gsks advertising tactics only serve to amplify fears and doubts patients may already have about antiretroviral therapy making it harder for doctors to treat them
7977617 it is important for patients and their providers to work together to make treatment decisions independent of drug industry advertising that might compromise the doctor patient relationship and potentially the health of the patient

7977621 the national park service has initiated a national register nomination form for the property the house will likely be demolished as it is surrounded by swedish hospital buildings and a parking garage while it could make for a wonderful addition to swedishs building inventory they are not in the business of preservation nps is not in a position to help this house as it is way beyond our authority to do this we have always talked about how it could be an associated property for the klondike gold rush national historic park but it is outside of the pioneer square historic district and the park nps is limited in what it can do nps would more than likely want to help interpret the history and significance of the place if it can be saved

7977701 these findings are important as the data suggest treatment with angiomax provides similar protection against ischemia and death over standard therapy at 1 year furthermore at 30 days we saw angiomax reduced major bleeding multiple studies have shown a significant association between bleeding complications in acs and pci with mortality
7977702 the data from the acuity sub analysis suggest treatment with angiomax is an attractive antithrombotic therapeutic option for patients undergoing pci
7977703 these data at 1 year show that angiomax continues to demonstrate safety and efficacy for a full year following a patient s angioplasty this is just the latest analysis from seven major randomized trials in nearly 25 000 patients consistently demonstrating angiomax offers improved outcomes for angioplasty patients compared to standard therapy
7977704 additionally angiomax may help reduce hospital costs particularly because of the reductions we have observed in major bleeding complications with approximately one million pci procedures performed in the u s per year incremental cost savings may result in substantial overall savings to the health care system

7977720 the clan has been one of the principle suppliers of heroin in western europe since the middle of the 90s
7977721 1 500 kg thats between 25 to 50 per cent of what people consume in switzerland in one year
7977722 the influence of ethnic albanian criminal groups is still very strong especially in the heroin market and its not abating
7977723 the vast majority of heroin sold in switzerland still transits via ethnic albanian groups
7977724 they had a period of unprecedented access to european markets in the 1990s and early 2000s and took advantage of that and others took advantage of them but stopping speedboat traffic to italy had a big effect i dont think theyre competitive in the long term
7977725 but i dont think this makes for a very competitive drug trafficking group in the long term as violence attracts unwanted attention what tends to happen with these albanian crime groups is that they build up to a certain level then they shoot each other over an honour issue which undermines their place in the market
7977726 the swiss police are quite good in stopping the stuff and make a lot of seizures but it continues to be a place that a lot of traffickers favour

7977804 while we should all enjoy the beautiful weather and it is late in the season we cannot let our guard down the best way to protect your family and yourself is to take simple prevention steps we urge everybody to use effective insect repellent and try to wear long sleeves and pants while outside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active with the heavy rains this summer it is especially important that people remove any water collecting on their property in artificial containers such as in flower pots or pool covers
7977805 we have continued our surveillance efforts this year for these diseases and will enhance local efforts as needed through state sponsored mosquito trapping

7978028 it is alleged she used the card for personal items
7978029 im very excited and very happy it came out like this
7978030 for a little while everyone was worried he might get away with this
7978031 do you expect someone on the church choir to be friends with this guy beltran we didnt pick our witnesses the defendant did you may not like zuno but he came in here and told you what he saw
7978032 although i had been a christian for more than two decades i had no concept of who jesus was as a person and no idea how i could change that
7978033 instead of trying to build a house church learn to love one another and share one anothers journey who is he asking you to walk alongside right now and how can you encourage them i love it when brothers and sisters choose to be intentional in sharing gods life together in a particular season so yes experiment with community together youll learn a lot just avoid the desire to make it contrived exclusive or permanent relationships dont work that way
7978034 fellowship happens where people share the journey of knowing jesus together it consists of open honest sharing genuine concern about one anothers spiritual well being and encouragement for people to follow jesus however he leads them
7978035 this is what the church is like doesnt my version look better
7978036 i can tell you absolutely that my worst days outside organized religion are still better than my best days inside it
7978037 most of what we call church today are nothing more than well planned performances with little actual connection between believers believers are encouraged toward a growing dependency on the system or its leadership rather than on jesus himself we spend more energy conforming behavior to what the institution needs rather than helping people be transformed at the foot of the cross
7978038 jesus indicated that whenever two or three people get together focused on him they would experience the vitality of church life
7978039 my favorite expression of body life is where a local group of people chooses to walk together for a bit of the journey by cultivating close friendships and learning how to listen to god together
7978040 by providing services to keep people coming an institution unwittingly becomes a distraction to real spiritual life it offers an illusion of spirituality in highly orchestrated experiences but it cannot show people how to live each day in him through the real struggles of life
7978041 the more organization you bring to church life the less life it will contain
7978042 as long as we see church life as a meeting well miss its reality and its depth if the truth were told the scriptures tell us very little about how the early church met it tells us volumes about how they shared life together they didnt see the church as a meeting or an institution but as a family living under father
7978043 any human system will eventually dehumanize the very people it seeks to serve and those it dehumanizes the most are those who think they lead it
7978044 gods wrath at the cross wasnt an expression of the punishment sin deserves it was the antidote for sin and shame
7978045 religious systems prey on peoples insecurity they havent learned how to live in fathers love to follow his voice and depend on him
7978046 whatever it is that you want to do you can do it trust god and dream big
7978047 im glad i had parents that helped us to dream im glad they taught us to pray about things that were on our mind and im really glad that god answers our prayers our parents taught us to dream but they also taught us something more important whatever we dreamed about we should tell god because he is the one that can make those plans succeed
7978048 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
7978049 fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom
7978050 have faith that god will bless you in this world and he will
7978051 serve god save the planet asks the following questions how can i live a more godly equitable and meaningful life how can i help people today and in the future how can i be less materialistic how can i live a more charitable life what would happen if i led a slower paced existence what is the spiritual prescription for depression anxiety and anger how can i become a better steward of nature
7978052 nothing is worse for the environment than a broken family
7978053 ethically designed and distributed birth control is an essential remedy if humanity is to survive its own success

7978057 will be pressed as the only answer to ecological problems and will be one more influence in the wests becoming increasingly eastern in its thinking
7978058 the only reason we are called upon to treat nature well is because of its effects on man and our children and the generations to come so in reality man is left with a completely egoistic position in regard to nature
7978059 having no absolutes modern man has no categories one cannot have real answers without categories and these men can have no categories beyond pragmatic technological ones
7978060 a pantheistic stand always brings man to an impersonal and low place rather than elevating him
7978061 so the christian treats things with integrity because we do not believe they are autonomous modern man has fallen into a dilemma because he has made things autonomous from god
7978062 we should be looking now on the basis of the work of christ for substantial healing in every area affected by the fall
7978063 by creation man has dominion but as a fallen creature he has used that dominion wrongly because he is fallen he exploits created things as thought they were nothing in themselves and as though he has an autonomous right to them
7978064 we must confess that we missed our opportunity we have spoken loudly against materialistic science but we have done little to show that in practice we ourselves as christians are not dominated by a technological orientation in regard either to man or nature
7978065 if we treat nature as having no intrinsic value our own value is diminished
7978066 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight

7978068 als we gaan trouwen is het onze dag ik moet er niet aan denken om shownieuws of rtl boulevard op mijn feest te hebben
7978069 ik wil het vooral priv houden we willen in ieder geval in de kerk trouwen ik weet niet of het een traditionele bruiloft wordt maar ik hoop dat yolanthe een witte jurk draagt
7978070 ik zit er naar te kijken wij hebben een traditionele rolverdeling de vrouw maakt schoon en de man niet zo ben ik ook opgevoed
7978071 so neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but only god who makes things grow
7978072 the words i have spoken to you are spirit and they have life
7978073 any more or additional fees under any circumstances other than the fees prescribed
7978074 we as women have waited long enough it is time to get rid of republican power i feel the power of women ready to rebuild a progressive america
7978075 womens lives are elected at every level of the government
7978076 this convention is not about whether barack obama is too black or not black enough it is about electing a charismatic humble president who can change this world
7978077 i have personally been called high yellow if you do not know what that means be thankful
7978078 another thing were doing with this release is focusing on the product edition that is most often stolen this will reduce the number of customers that will be offered the package this release will be offered to the most pirated edition of windows xp and therefore to users with the highest likelihood of having a non genuine copy those using windows xp pro were also offering it to those using editions based on pro code such as tablet and windows media center but plan to narrow the offering to pro in future releases
7978079 microsoft is making these changes to simplify the installation process making it easy for customers to stay up to date to increase the effectiveness of these notifications and to align experiences across windows xp and windows vista

7978084 hello sir you want tuk tuk to royal palace russian market
7978085 they couldnt admit to anything because they hadnt committed any
7978086 you know these people are brave to have their pictures put up here
7978087 they have normal lives now and yet theyre prepared to admit what they once were
7978088 please sit here for a moment while i tell you a bit about this terrible place
7978089 every prisoner from s 21 was brought here it was a one way journey for every one of them because they would be all killed they were all blindfolded and very thin they had spent maybe two months in interrogation maybe three hundred prisoners were killed each day usually as soon as they arrived the guards would normally kill them with a spade or a hatchet because bullets were too expensive
7978090 you may have noticed that cambodian people dont talk much about this atrocity but i promise you that they never forget every may cambodian families bring their children here to see nighttime falls on the river with posters showcasing phnom penh and siem reap what pol pot did they teach them so that this can never happen again
7978091 the prisoners were laid out side by side not allowed to speak not allowed to move and then one by one their skulls were bashed with tool music blasted out from loudspeakers to muffle the wails and when they were dead they were thrown into mass graves i will show you these now please come
7978092 when khmer rouge bury people they did not do it according to religion or creed they were dumped on top of each other without thought and then covered with dirt but as the bodies decomposed they filled with gas which made them rise to surface that is how the graves were eventually found this single grave here held maybe fifty bodies
7978093 was where guards killed the babies they smashed their tiny bodies against trunk like a piece of rubbish and then they throw them in here
7978094 this was full of women and children the women were all naked raped by guards before killing
7978095 he wanted to get rid of anyone with education so that he could start from year zero in his mind farmers would take over the land providing everything the country needed intellectuals were a barrier to his plan they had to be re educated this of course meant being killed for khmer rouge they were not killing innocent people they were only re educating them
7978096 khmer rouge used them as guards in s 21 the children knew no difference victims of the khmer rouge prison s 21 only what they wanted them to believe you cant really blame them but even the guards were not safe from his regime look
7978097 their heads were cut off to make sure they were really dead pol pot didnt want them to take revenge but it wasnt just the soldiers who were killed their wives and children were slaughtered so that no memory could ever remain
7978098 the guards told the prisoners to lie down with their eyes shut then the shackles could go around their ankles an iron bar was pushed through these holes to hold the shackles in place
7978099 as you would expect some prisoners had bigger feet than others but this did not wad of cambodian riels matter to guards they would bang the metal rod breaking ankle bones so it went through to the next shackle
7978100 maybe theyre going to chop us up and eat us
7978101 but god knows how he can see under there itll be like feeling about in the dark
7978102 were probably his first paying passengers for months and this boat is their home theyre his neighbours look even if it doesnt start we should still give them a few dollars i feel so sorry for them

7978106 i think it is time for us to move on
7978107 the mainstream press covered it as if it were an amusing lark a dungeons amp dragons convention with laptops
7978108 fewer than half of the westerners polled and 48 percent in nevada consider climate change to be scientifically established reality
7978109 im thinking about running myself so you could add me to the list
7978110 there is a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation and this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7978111 where there are permanent taliban settlements and where organized crime groups profit from the instability
7978112 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history
7978113 more than half of afghanistan provinces are now poppy free
7978114 the gains in the north and east show that counternarctocis efforts can succeed
7978115 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it

7978120 both the percentage and number of people without health insurance decreased in 2007
7978121 the number of children covered by government health insurance programs increased to 31 percent from 29 8 percent in 2006
7978122 this is the main reason for the fall in the uninsured rates in children and for the fall in uninsured rates in the general population
7978123 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
7978124 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
7978125 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway

7978141 were looking forward to mobilizing and training students to take back the necessary skills to lead successful college democrat chapters and get ready for november 2008
7978142 our job this fall is to mobilize our own campuses
7978143 every student needs to understand the importance of voting for democratic candidates this fall
7978144 being involved locally is the best way to get involved
7978145 everything starts at the local level students learn enormously about campaigns by knocking on doors stuffing envelopes and attending county democratic meetings
7978146 people are tending more and more to identify with the issues the democratic party cares about issues like making college affordable for students bringing the troops home from iraq and creating more jobs so that recent college graduates have a good job that comes with good health care
7978147 to keep the momentum moving after denver were going to have to be out door to door explaining to students how sen obama will work harder to advance the issues that are important to us
7978148 we have to convince them enough that their support equals the desire to follow through and vote
7978149 if you look at the iowa caucus results from 2008 youth vote was up three times from 2004
7978150 youth turnout has consistently increased from 2004 to 2006 and we expect the same in 2008 based on the primaries people arent just excited about his candidacy theyre turning out to vote
7978151 college democrats are running a lot of the campaigns on their campuses getting their friends involved and using the tools at their disposal in their local college democrats chapter as a result they are getting people out to vote for all the candidates the democratic party has to offer
7978152 students see they have more engagement with a local leader than they ever will have with the president of the united states
7978153 it is just as important to make sure that we have good leadership at the local level as it is on the national level
7978154 its really important to keep pushing the issues in a positive way
7978155 people are more likely to listen to what you have to say and engage in a conversation about the issues if they arent already defensive about something you said earlier
7978156 the long primary season was actually helpful because so many more students are registered to vote at this point than in a normal election year
7978157 students have already proven that they arent just coming out to support sen obama theyre showing up to vote for him too
7978158 the republicans can attempt to scare people away with those ads
7978159 but these students arent just drawn to obamas celebrity status they finally have a young fresh candidate with a new outlook who cares about issues that are important to them
7978160 we are excited to be a part of the ymca strong adventure race this year
7978161 with the race practically in our backyard we wanted to do something special in keeping with the spirit of the we are offering an entry to a team that normally might not be able to afford to race a longer distance
7978162 after that however from what we learn from the stock markets in analogous phases of their dynamics such a long periodically decelerating phase is likely to dissolve and thus the market may start resuming the up trend

7978165 oregonians are at the end of their rope with gordon smiths misleading ads
7978166 smith failed in his responsibility to investigate the iraq threat and then criticized people like me who opposed the war from the beginning not until six of his republican colleagues lost reelection in 2006 did smith decide to speak out and even then refused to take a tough stance to bring our sons and daughters home america needs leaders who believe in what they fight for and will fight for what they believe in some times that is politically inconvenient but that is what real leadership is all about
7978167 many individual stocks have been absolutely taken to the woodshed

7978177 but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
7978178 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
7978179 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
7978180 learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings

7978183 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7978184 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7978185 funding arrangements for schools that are riddled with anomalies and flaws
7978186 the only way out in the longer term is for a root and branch review of the arrangements involving all funding partners
7978187 1 5 billion for government schools would be required merely to reclaim the sector shares in place at the outset of the howard years
7978188 if continued they will result in a cut in real terms for the school system that educates the majority of australian children
7978189 howard government policies benefited non government schools by almost 3 billion in real terms a funding advantage of around 2 5 billion over the real increases provided for government schools
7978190 for the first time in decades the pay equity gap grew wider after many women were forced onto individual contracts that stripped their pay to the barest levels in many cases illegally underpaying them and removing job security
7978191 it is essential that we see new ir laws introduced into parliament that scrap the rest of work choices and ensure all workers especially women get back their rights at work
7978192 the report was regrettably seen in some quarters as big business yet again being negative and failing to assist australia to address the challenge of climate change

7978211 the united states condemns the decision by the russian president to recognize as independent states the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
7978212 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
7978213 abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so

7978215 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal mdg of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015

7978219 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
7978220 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening the timing and extent of any change in policy stance would depend on evolving economic financial developments and the implications for the outlook for economic growth and inflation
7978221 a gross violation of international law bilateral and multilateral treaties
7978222 ukraine should respect the will of the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia
7978223 only the united nations can rule on this question of the status of south ossetia and abkhazia
7978224 in addition members saw continuing downside risks to this outlook particularly reflecting possible further deterioration in financial conditions
7978225 although measures of core inflation might well edge up later this year given the pass through to final goods prices of earlier increases in the prices of energy and other inputs most participants anticipated that core inflation would edge back down during 2009
7978226 i think the statement is pretty dovish on inflation there is a lot more text discussing the weakness on the economy like consumer spending there seems more emphasis on the downside risks to growth

7978234 we kept it nice and tight we got that early goal everything was going perfectly but there was going to be some stage when we had to push forward and get that second goal
7978235 unfortunately they caught us on the break there and punished us back to 1 1

7978240 one time kedi pushed me over and took my lollipop true story
7978241 kedi your existence is i think proof that god does not
7978242 runs away from the bear trap that kedi loaded up
7978243 kedi spoke and there was magnificence for the intelligent and headaches for the ignorant
7978244 that is creating causing real strains for individuals at the gas pump thats causing a strain for business people as they see their input costs rising and its causing inflation in our system
7978245 the last thing we want to do in this economy though is raise taxes
7978246 i am not running for senate i am not running for senate
7978247 kontrak jual beli mtn itu di cover dengan jaminan korupsi itu kan mencuri uang negara saya tidak mencuri
7978248 i feel sad i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7978249 i feel sad i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7978250 that game will be the last thing on a players mind
7978251 that game helped us finalize our recruiting class and helped us springboard into our offseason program it wont do anything for us when we line up to play bowling green
7978252 theres definitely been a tremendous change from this time last year to now
7978253 all the hype the attention im not a secret to anybody now they all know what i can do
7978254 i like to think hes smarter and a little stronger
7978255 i like his mindset were making good decisions using the people around him
7978256 if i could move a day race under the lights i would move because
7978257 if i could take one of the two races away from auto club speedway formerly known as california speedway i would move it to because
7978258 any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
7978259 we reviewed all the medical records and spoke with the victims physician and the evidence showed that the loss of the fetus was not related to or a result of the crash caused by the defendant
7978260 they gave him an iv to get fluids into him and they made him go to sleep
7978261 if he was doing drugs if he had been drunk if he had gone out there and done what he did because he was pissed off at someone that would be a completely different story
7978262 rampage feels awful about the womans baby but he had nothing to do with it and the traffic incident occurred because he was very ill and not with him in control of his faculties
7978263 standing up hes the baddest man on the planet right now there is nobody who can stand with kimbo slice
7978264 im the same guy as the head coach as i was as an assistant coach ive just switched offices and if i change shame on me
7978265 i guess i want to make the most of it so im going to do whatever i can to make that happen im just trying to win whatever way possible
7978266 i like all coaches am very leery and scared of the opening game
7978267 we respect the villanova wildcats and coach andy talley they were 7 4 in 2007 and im a little jumpy about that
7978268 it was based on our research and discussions weve had with fans
7978269 public financing is going to be less and less a factor in building new stadiums and arenas and it certainly was the case with us
7978270 this is a team thats never had its own home
7978271 the concept of having a home field is a major concept i dont think theres anything including super bowl iii that matches the impact that this building will have
7978272 if he can more or less perform for us as he did two or three years ago hell be a great help
7978273 i look back on my career and when i was at oregon state the year we won the fiesta bowl and lost one game we opened with eastern washington in corvallis and had to score at the end of the game to win it
7978274 we were very fortunate to win that football game a year before that we played georgia southern in corvallis and won by three points
7978275 so nau has a great program and their players are going to be hungry they dont have anything to lose they are going to give us everything we want
7978276 i mean our second year at washington state was pretty good they were familiar with what was going on the same thing at oregon state overall just familiarizing yourself with whats going on will help
7978277 i think i have an even better grasp of the offense than i did last year and i think even more is that i have been here for a while
7978278 the game has slowed down a lot for me overall decision making knowing when to try and make plays when to cut my losses and throw the ball away and trusting guys to make plays around me
7978279 i believe the second season if everything is equal you should be a little bit better because you know what you are doing offensively
7978280 however our schedule this year is quite different than it was a year ago
7978281 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
7978282 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
7978283 haber cabeza de mi miembro que es mas grande que tu langostino de rio pinc sin nombre

7978287 i have no problems using him in any phase right now whether its first and 10 short yardage goal line or third down but were still two weeks away hell find his actual role
7978288 i saw a difference in aaron he was more assertive in the huddle
7978289 hes got such a good burst when he sees something he hits the hole hard you watch him and its hard for the first guy to bring him down hes always breaking a tackle and getting those extra yards and falling forward
7978290 ricky has found a profound sense of inner peace through yoga and zen practice
7978291 kevin in his career has become such a technician at what he does that if hes like a tenth of a second slower here or three speedwise hell find a way to make it up
7978292 he has a knack for getting open once you put it in his vicinity hes going to catch it
7978293 d will expected to be the explosive yin to stewarts power yang has excelled in training camp
7978294 its been a long time and its so important to get some reps to get the game speed down and to actually have some contact
7978295 hopefully this week ill be able to get in and get some game action and a whole lot of practice after that
7978296 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
7978297 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
7978298 most of the people cant see the beautiful and perfection of an ooze crawling in the dark but not me i have learned to admire those simple creatures and imitate their abilities
7978299 this is the first time that all three high schools exceeded the national sat score on the traditional verbal and math averages of the test and the first year that our school system as a whole exceeded the national average
7978300 i have already returned to moscow so i will not play in kyiv i can confirm im moving to tottenham

7978305 the 2g phone is not coming to us as you can get a 3g phone from the official market at rs 31 000 so why should anyone pay rs 25 000 also apple which was selling the 2g phone at 399 bundled with a connection is now selling the 3g at 199 also bundled with a connection so obviously why would anyone buy an older model
7978306 at the moment we are only catering to customers who are not ready to wait for the delivery of the phone from the operators they are paying a premium of only rs 1 000 to get it from us
7978307 considering the fact that in the us the apple 3g phone offer with at amp t is locked in a two year agreement with an operator which costs around us 2 000 in india the difference between the official and grey market price will not be more than rs 2 000 to rs 5 000 that will not be too attractive as the official phone with a one year warranty looks more attractive
7978308 we can unlock the phone so that it can be used for any operator and not only for airtel and vodafone for rs 1 500
7978309 i think well view the super cup as a one off and we want to win it obviously but it is also an opportunity to play anderson who is back from the olympic games nani whos available from a suspension and if possible gary neville
7978310 i think those three will figure in friday nights game
7978311 i think they proved themselves particularly with their performances away from home last season
7978312 were there because we are successful it is also an opportunity to give players the experience of playing in a game of that nature
7978313 we may have won the first game 3 0 but we have a really tough second leg ahead
7978314 obviously our lead is healthy but we need to work even harder if we want to get to the group stage i want those who take the field against olympiacos to use all their strength to achieve our ultimate dream were close but the game that stands in our way is very tough
7978315 not being able to play in games like these is one of the things you regret once you stop playing
7978316 it comes from within i feel we can advance if we handle the stress we must start the match believing we can do it and we have to channel this belief in our game
7978317 with the help of our fans we can get the result that will take us into the group stage
7978318 we must be patient and hopefully well be luckier than two weeks ago in cyprus

7978322 its extremely important for parents to ensure that they and their children are protected against vaccine preventable diseases including whooping cough
7978323 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum
7978324 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7978325 this is about stepping up and being a global leader with our levis brand sold in more than 110 countries we are the no 1 jeans company in the world this campaign gives us a unique opportunity to let a new generation of jeans consumers around the world know that the original quintessential 501 jean is contemporary and relevant to their lifestyle no other jeans brand can do this
7978326 the word unbuttoned appealed to me since to me it has special meaning as i see it unbuttoning is not an act but an attitude i am very selective in choosing the brands i endorse the image and positioning of the brand is of utmost importance levis and me have a perfect fit in that respect i am extremely excited about being a part of this brand and campaign now and in the future
7978327 im looking forward to this experience with great anticipation its like entering absolutely unknown territory the thrill is immense also it gives me the chance to understand my audience at an extremely intimate unbuttoned level and there can be no greater high for an actor
7978328 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar

7978330 my plan got delayed but now im working on it
7978331 things will fall into place very shortly ill star in the film and direct it is that too much responsibility
7978332 im passionate about being a director ive lots to say and i hope audiences accept me as a director as much as they have as an actor

7978341 we fuss and fuss at people to get surge protectors and they do work
7978342 were fortunate we got the fire call if it hadnt been for that call there is no telling what would have happened to the building
7978343 i didnt get a lot of school when i was a child i guess they didnt have enough to go around

7978352 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
7978353 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
7978354 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
7978355 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
7978356 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
7978357 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now
7978358 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
7978359 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
7978360 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7978361 american businesses and consumers were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7978362 the overall mood is still one of caution theres not much out there to get investors excited
7978363 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7978364 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
7978365 when a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors they buried the information and continued the illegal practice
7978366 we take issue with the states characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement
7978367 this agreement affirms our actions and we are continuing to make full refunds to all affected customers
7978368 the vp message was sent in the late hours of friday night and is by many accounts the single largest mobile marketing event in the u s to date
7978369 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages even sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media
7978370 the value of the message goes far beyond the 26 words and 2 9 million recipients here obama branded himself as cutting edge inflated the already enormous press attention paid to his v p pick and further established a list of supporters most coveted form of contact their cell phone numbers
7978371 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
7978372 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
7978373 ive tried not to have long discussions about short lists long lists but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that you know senator clinton would have been on anybodys shortlist and so i took her very seriously
7978374 no meetings no conversations no requests for information no real consideration whatsoever
7978375 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7978376 both because she wants a democrat in the white house and because she does not want to be blamed if we dont have one
7978377 she wants to go above and beyond to ensure that if it doesnt happen nobody points the finger at her
7978378 shes emerged from this campaign as an even more powerful force and shes going to map out a strategy where she can make a difference in peoples lives

7978384 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7978385 i just dont think he gets it he is out of touch i dont think he realizes what ordinary american families are going through
7978386 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get our country back on the right path
7978387 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7978388 all you need is 200 people in that crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
7978389 didnt always comport myself in the way that i wanted to
7978390 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7978391 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7978392 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7978393 did democrats waste first day did bush get free pass
7978394 the torch passed again to a new generation of americans
7978395 our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7978396 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously in the rear view mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7978397 if this party has a message its done a heck of a job hiding it
7978398 i look at this and i am about to jump out of my chair the non prime time part was not particularly impressive the other stuff was completely void of any message
7978399 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7978400 wouldnt make sense for me to try to edit his remarks
7978401 remember 18 million people voted for me 18 million people give or take voted for barack
7978402 we never considered that interferon alpha could be a major player in early type 1 diabetes
7978403 a normal process programmed cell death causes a normal response
7978404 but it does this in such a way that in a small subset of the population it starts them on the road to type 1 diabetes
7978405 the take home message for women is that whether you are hooked on caffeine or not if you need a boost coffee improves your mental alertness and can have a calming affect on your heart rate
7978406 in addition a large coffee has more than enough caffeine to see these changes
7978407 this indicates that there may be some long term cardiovascular adjustment to digesting caffeine on a daily basis
7978408 for people at risk for high blood pressure if youre a habituated
7978409 we have observed previously that the idea of smoking a cigarette becomes increasingly attractive to smokers while they are craving
7978410 this study suggests that when smokers are not craving they fail to appreciate just how powerful their cravings will be this lack of insight while not craving may lead them to make decisions such as choosing to attend a party where there will be lots of smoking that they may come to regret
7978411 these findings suggest that smokers are likely to underpredict their own future desire to smoke when theyre not craving a cigarette
7978412 the research not only has implications for helping smokers quit but it also enlightens us on how nonsmokers may pick up the habit if smokers cant appreciate the intensity of their need to smoke when they arent currently craving whats the likelihood that people who have never smoked can do so
7978413 four bodies were found at the scene of the clash at barakhama but the identity of the deceased is yet to be established
7978414 we have verified the antecedents of the woman and found that she was a hindu
7978415 all the studies had undergone scientific scrutiny and had all the required regulatory and ethical approvals
7978416 there was no question of targeting any socioeconomic group selectively
7978417 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
7978418 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
7978419 we see this vote in geneva as a milestone and an example for those parts of switzerland that have yet to ban smoking
7978420 these moves fit well with uiccs current cancer prevention campaign
7978421 smoke free legislation has been gathering pace ever since 2004 when ireland became the first country to go completely smoke free it plays a critical role in promoting public health
7978422 we are especially pleased that geneva may well be smoke free before our 20th world cancer congress takes place here at the end of august
7978423 a common treatment performed in the past and present is surgical excision of fat to treat a herniation of fat meaning that the amount of fat in the eye socket does not change but the cover that holds the fat in place the orbital septum is weakened or broken and fat slips out
7978424 this orbital septum weakening or herniation of fat theory is what most plastic surgeons have been taught
7978425 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
7978426 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
7978427 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
7978428 our study showed that a component of a patients blepharoplasty procedure should almost routinely involve fat excision rather than these procedures
7978429 although baggy lower eyelids are a significant result of aging and fat expansion there are other factors that can contribute too
7978430 we recommend that surgeons evaluate each component and address them accordingly in an individualized approach to blepharoplasty
7978431 we are assisting paramedics and helping with provision of relief supplies we will go on increasing the rescue scale as far as we can
7978432 we do not know what will be the discharge tomorrow so the situation continues to be alarming an additional 500 country boats have been deployed
7978433 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why
7978434 we looked at it through our nmr machine and were amazed by what we saw fluid simulating patients bodies rushed calcium out of the bioglass and then into the new bones it seems perhaps a glass of milk a day really is what the doctor ordered
7978435 some 14 million riyals 3 8 million has been allocated for the project
7978436 more than 600 000 people are expected to benefit from the project this year
7978437 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7978438 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7978439 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7978440 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7978441 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7978442 get off the road old man youre going about one mile an hour
7978443 its not a matter of if it will enter the gulf but when and where
7978444 if it goes across the western tip of cuba it will only lose a little strength before intensifying again in the gulf
7978445 but if it goes into the sierra maestras its going to get torn up
7978446 gustav is more likely to track further west into the gulf
7978447 the policy is badly thought out its based on bad premises
7978448 and if the economics arent fundamentally there youve created a very big industry thats more costly than it needs to be and so will want to keep its subsidies
7978449 supporters of the ethanol mandate have their hearts in the right place if they want to diversify this nations fuel supply
7978450 but artificially propping up an industry to the detriment of the vast majority of americans is bad policy and thats what this mandate does
7978451 people often forget that it costs money to collect the material when they talk about it
7978452 its also an open question as to how much waste there is
7978453 instead of an expensive enzyme we use a bacteria that can change anything from woodchips to diapers and nasty waste even methane gas from landfills into ethanol
7978454 this way you can use locally available material and you dont need a pipeline to send the ethanol to the coast
7978455 theres such a demand from politicians and non governmental organizations for easy answers but we dont think were a silver bullet
7978456 wheat yield potential is greatest in south central kansas when planted between sept 25 and oct 20 and in southeast kansas when planted between oct 5 and oct 25
7978457 hessian fly aphids and wheat curl mites are more likely to invade earlier planted wheat causing damage and vectoring viral diseases such as barley yellow dwarf and wheat streak mosaic
7978458 if planting early the best management practice against insects and disease is to select resistant varieties with good yield potential
7978459 systemic insecticide seed treatments may provide a benefit against some insects and the viral diseases they vector however these can be costly and are an added expense if insects are not present
7978460 with so many farm costs going up and with the excellent quality we are now seeing in corn hybrids were happy to see this pilot program expand
7978461 and were especially happy to see the way industry has worked together to develop the technology to lower risks on the farm and help us meet all corn needs
7978462 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
7978463 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
7978464 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
7978465 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago
7978466 the late stellar assembly of massive cluster galaxies via major merging
7978467 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
7978468 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7978469 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
7978470 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
7978471 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
7978472 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
7978473 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun
7978474 there have been hundreds of thousands if not millions of violations of predatory lending laws over the last nine years
7978475 there are four incredibly powerful federal laws that have been around for decades but are relatively unknown or misunderstood to the average consumer the fair housing truth in lending equal credit opportunity and real estate settlement practices acts collectively give hopeless homeowners plenty of leverage to play some serious hardball with their mortgage companies

7978479 we who have witnessed the obscenity of war and experienced its horror and terrible consequences have an obligation to rise above our pain and suffering and turn the tragedy of our lives into a triumph
7978480 we know from a century of northern resource exploration that there is gas in the beaufort sea oil in the eastern arctic and gold in the yukon there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the sea ice and tundra
7978481 but what weve found so far is merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg
7978482 use it or lose it is the first principle of arctic sovereignty
7978483 to develop the north we must know the north to protect the north we must control the north and to accomplish all our goals for the north we must be in the north
7978484 currently the company is unable to fully ascertain the effect of this on the companys financial position
7978485 as scientists were excited about this discovery because its a fundamentally new approach to regulating what enzymes do in cells
7978486 the fact that it also offers a potentially novel use of a drug already widely in use for other applications is an unexpected bonus
7978487 understanding how the cell works should allow us to affect the activity of enzymes in one neighborhood and leave alone their identical twins in a different neighborhood in that cell
7978488 the idea is to use a pde5 inhibitor such as viagra selectively to inhibit platelet function
7978489 there is certainly a section of the market that feels that the valuations are very high axons valuations are almost 17 times its cy08 earnings this is the same as infosys fy09 valuations moreover the axon management has acknowledged that its european business will be slow compared to other markets in the future its europe penetration is already at 16 17 per cent so even the business growth in europe is a bit ambiguous

7978492 we made the very difficult decision to permanently close the facility following a strategic review of the mills ability to be competitive both today and over the longer term
7978493 given a variety of factors including our business outlook the structural challenges of operating in this region and the condition of the mill at the time it was delivered to us by potlatch we simply cannot rationalize making the significant investment required to make the mill economically viable
7978494 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
7978495 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
7978496 the opening is to talk at any opportunity not to wait three weeks to have a meeting obviously that indicates a fundamental difference between the government and the opposition parties
7978497 im looking forward to working exclusively with dx to release my latest installment of the bar exam series bar exam 2 as a free digital download the reason we decided to do this as a free digital download is because i wanted to give the fans an opportunity to see where i am as an artist and what to expect from me in the near future
7978498 we wanted to get a host who could carry the torch behind the incredible job of statik selektah and dj premier dj green lantern was the obvious choice but due to our hectic schedules we didnt know if it would work out green has been on the road the entire summer with rock the bells djing for nas and releasing mix cds with other artists but we finally found a date and time that would work best for both of us and now were able to bring the fans a worth the wait follow up
7978499 my main focus was to work with artists from the d to further expand what was started by shady with me and d12 almost 10 years ago these are artists that i not only respect but who are creating and building a huge buzz in and for our city

7978502 the companies are exposed to the risk that the state could at any time declare them a public utility and take them over or buy them
7978503 one group of transnationals are going away so another group of transnationals come in
7978504 the recent decline in the spot and futures prices of energy means that the temporary spike in total cpi inflation between now and the first quarter of 2009 should be lower than projected in july
7978505 the main upside and downside risks are the same as they were in our july mpr monetary policy report
7978506 theyve made a change so i would have to say they may not be as concerned about inflation
7978507 but the other side of that point is that he specifically addressed the fact that growth in the u s is stronger than they had projected so i look at that as a bit of an offset
7978508 i just dont get the sense that there is a major change here
7978509 what will happen later on is anyones guess but i think in the medium term the bank will likely maintain its neutral stance
7978510 these two developments will have opposing effects on the demand for canadian goods and services

7978512 the imf gave the figures in a note prepared for the meeting in rio de janeiro
7978513 and youve got a lot of concern and i think its very warranted about other forms of debt coming due and youre seeing delinquency rates on credit cards for example going up to levels you havent seen in a long time
7978514 it looks like the trend has certainly been set for lower banking sector earnings than expectations
7978515 bmo was quite a disappointment it was quite a bit lower than the targets
7978516 scotia did better than bmo and thats part and parcel of the fact that they have very limited u s operations and the u s economy and housing market have gone in the tank much faster than the developing markets
7978517 there are challenging results out of the u s and i think the market rewards scotia for not playing in that pool
7978518 the other banks will have higher provisions for credit losses too but i think this is very specific to bmo because its fairway thats causing the problem here
7978519 people are really going to be watching whats happening on the domestic side
7978520 theyve kind of written off the foreign divisions of all the banks that have u s exposure and expect bad things there
7978521 this marks a noticeable deceleration versus the strong 9 5 percent growth rate posted last quarter and supports our view that the flagship franchises of the canadian banks are in for a period of softer growth given the pressure on the top line
7978522 i definitely dont think id be as successful as i am

7978770 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe isolation is looming

7978814 the u s intelligence community buckled sooner in 2002 than previously reported to bush administration pressure for data justifying an invasion of iraq
7978815 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis which then conformed to public positions taken by pentagon and white house officials
7978816 surge is a success in the context of a devastated population in an obliterated nation lacking in the most essential supplies and services a nation where death continues on a shopping spree
7978817 a recently declassified draft of the cias october 2002 white paper on iraqi wmd programs demonstrates that that the white paper long pre dated the compilation of the national intelligence estimate on iraqi capabilities
7978818 bush administration and the tony blair government began acting in concert to build support for an invasion of iraq two to three months earlier than previously understood
7978819 a comparison of the cia draft white paper with its publicly released edition shows that all the changes made were in the nature of strengthening its charges against iraq by inserting additional alarming claims in the manner of an advocacy or public relations document
7978820 the draft and final papers show no evidence of intelligence analysis applied to the information contained
7978821 baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or cbw against the united states fearing that exposure of iraqi involvement would provide washington a stronger cause for making war

7978861 these mobile services include extras such as ring tones wallpapers and information services
7978862 they are featured in many advertisements in magazines on television and on the internet
7978863 while these extras may offer variety and entertainment for some consumers they are also the subject of ongoing complaints this has led the accc to turn its attention to the advertising practices in the industry
7978864 as many of these services are directed at the younger less experienced consumer the accc is particularly concerned over what it considers is the failure of certain advertisements to adequately disclose the costs and ongoing nature of the services offered
7978865 television advertisements with small print disclosure and busy or distracting images and magazine advertisements featuring tiny print and confusing clutter mean that many consumers would not appreciate the significant ongoing costs they could incur by simply texting in to the number on the screen or in print
7978866 many consumers have reported to the accc that they were not fully aware of the costs of the services until they received their first bill or found that they had used up all their pre paid credit
7978867 the accc has updated its website information for consumers on mobile premium services and recommends that anyone wanting to buy a mobile premium service should take note of all the terms and conditions to avoid an unexpectedly high phone bill or rapidly vanishing phone credit
7978868 advertisers of these services should also take the opportunity to review their advertising practices attempts to distract and confuse so that consumers cannot make informed choices are not acceptable such advertising practices may also potentially be in breach of the trade practices act 1974
7978869 it allows the government policy to be carried out smoothly and opens up the market for more operators which ultimately will benefit the consumer

7979257 the images generated through millimeter wave are lower resolution than that of x ray backscatter and as a result privacy may be less of a concern for the traveling public

7979265 they flipped through my journal and filmed everything every sheet of paper that i had front and back i told them im going back to chengdu tomorrow morning look heres my bus ticket but they said were going to return your bus ticket and take you to kangding for further investigation apparently it wasnt in their jurisdiction to process my case where we were i kept telling them i need to call the us embassy but they very simply clarified you are a chinese citizen traveling in china on your chinese documents youll be prosecuted according to chinese law i didnt have any rights as an american at that point

7979357 when we are faced with members of congress beholden to those extreme special interest groups who are dedicated to locking up our natural resources and limiting the rights of the individual american it is important to have national leaders like ron stand up and fight for all of us

7979383 for more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well publicized incidents to attack the rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over american political and economic institutions some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the united states characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure one world if you will if thats the charge i stand guilty and i am proud of it

7979388 i signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7979389 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7979390 well the status of those two regions in georgia are not a matter for any one country to decide theyre a matter for the international community through the mechanisms at the united nations
7979391 how we go forward in dealing with the two regions and what their interests are and the interests of georgia are should be a matter of peaceful negotiations and discussion among the parties thats where we would like to get to
7979392 this is contrary to the principles of the independence the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
7979393 the recognition of independence for south ossetia and abkhazia violates fundamental osce principles as all osce participating states russia is committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others
7979394 russia should follow osce principles by respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia russia should immediately withdraw all troops from georgia and implement the ceasefire agreement including the modalities defined in the 16 august letter of french president nicolas sarkozy the international community cannot accept unilaterally established buffer zones
7979395 if medvedev does this it would be to further aggravate the relationship between russia and the west
7979396 russia is practically setting itself against the whole world in the nearest future one can expect a chill in relations
7979397 i think that for russia this is a dangerous situation
7979398 and it can fall into international isolation in the west no one thought yesterday that russia would recognize the independence of the republics that is why the west is shocked i think that the west will react emotionally sending ships into the black sea threatening countries that will support russias decision with sanctions georgia will likely be accepted into nato although im not sure of this
7979399 what the georgians did in the unrecognized republics and from then on my sympathy rested on the side of abkhazia and south ossetia unfortunately georgia never did find a model which would allow it to retain these republics
7979400 russia has legalized what it was threatening to do for a long time now
7979401 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
7979402 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
7979403 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
7979404 most members did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative given that many households and businesses were facing elevated borrowing costs and reduced credit availability
7979405 although members generally anticipated that the next policy move would likely be a tightening
7979406 to help restrain inflation and inflation expectations which were at risk of drifting higher
7979407 saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation

7979416 diese banken m ssen sich bewusst sein dass sich teile dieser gelder wieder verfl chtigen wenn sich der bankensektor stabilisiert
7979417 die gegenw rtige marktlage hat zum einen dazu gef hrt dass sowohl die verwalteten verm gen h ufig geschrumpft sind
7979418 es ist nicht so dass die kunden jetzt scharenweise ihre bank wechseln

7979420 die verm gen sind im europ ischen private banking deutlich weniger mobil als anderswo etwa in den usa

7979433 the internet is a hugely important organizing tool but it is not a substitute for face to face house to house precinct to precinct campaigning by real people its an incredible fundraising tool its an incredible organizing tool hes now got 2 million contributors every one of whom in my opinion ought to be asked to work a precinct thats what got deval patrick elected a guy whod never run for elected office and he won by 21 percentage points i recognize the enormous importance of online campaigning but anybody who tells you that old fashioned accountable door to door campaigning is obsolete doesnt know whats going on
7979434 3 billion dollars a year ill take 125 miles an hour anywhere in the country between cities and by the way theres not a region in the country that doesnt want this
7979435 i would argue that separating the freight and the passenger trains would be better for the freights and they would welcome it believe me this is a no brainer
7979436 the only thing between three hours between boston to new york which would effectively eliminate air transportation is improving that between new haven and new york
7979437 talk to those states in the midwest theyd love 125 miles per hour
7979438 its both expecting the mbta to survive on a penny off the sales tax a year was just a great mistake when i was governor capital investment in the mbta was the responsibility of the state government

7979453 en el primer set sal muy nerviosa porque era mi primer partido en un cuadro principal de un grande y ella me presion mucho luego pens que me ten a que soltar que no ten a nada que perder y empec a jugar bien
7979454 aunque tuve la fortuna de sin jugar tambi n pude ganar y pasar de ronda

7979474 ik heb het nummer een aantal jaren geleden aangeboden aan de platenmaatschappij van ti sto maar die wees mijn demo af
7979475 het kan toch niet dat er een dj is die toevallig een nummer maakt dat zestien maten lang exact hetzelfde is als mijn nummer
7979476 ik wil geen ruzie met de platenmaatschappij en uiteraard ook niet met ti sto maar ik hoop wel dat er een oplossing wordt gevonden

7979493 but the bigger picture is that there hasnt really been a major breakdown considering all the bad headlines out there from higher oil prices to the credit crisis and troubled housing sector
7979494 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
7979495 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle

7979542 habl con la plantilla y les dec a a los jugadores que la obligaci n era entregarse en el terreno de juego correr luchar y pelear por esta camiseta esa es la obligaci n y la transmiti el presidente pero no habl de resultados

7979646 una mente vivace e tranquilla pu essere soddisfatta anche senza vedere nulla e non vede nulla che non le piaccia
7979647 reply to objection 3 as damascene says de fide orth iii 6 11 the divine nature is said to be incarnate because it is united to flesh personally and not that it is changed into flesh so likewise the flesh is said to be deified as he also says de fide orth 15 17 not by change but by union with the word its natural properties still remaining and hence it may be considered as deified inasmuch as it becomes the flesh of the word of god but not that it becomes god
7979648 proclaiming the death according to the flesh of the only begotten son of god that is jesus christ confessing his resurrection from the dead and his ascension into heaven we offer the unbloody sacrifice in the churches and so go on to the mystical thanksgivings and are sanctified having received his holy flesh and the precious blood of christ the saviour of us all and not as common flesh do we receive it god forbid nor as of a man sanctified and associated with the word according to the unity of worth or as having a divine indwelling but as truly the life giving and very flesh of the word himself for he is the life according to his nature as god and when he became united to his flesh he made it also to be life giving as also he said to us verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood for we must not think that it is flesh of a man like us for how can the flesh of man be life giving by its own nature but as having become truly the very own of him who for us both became and was called son of man
7979649 and we have learned that those only are deified who have lived near to god in holiness and virtue and we believe that those who live wickedly and do not repent are punished in everlasting fire
7979650 he speaks undoubtedly these words to those who have not received the gift of adoption but who despise the incarnation of the pure generation of the word of god defraud human nature of promotion into god and prove themselves ungrateful to the word of god who became flesh for them for it was for this end that the word of god was made man and he who was the son of god became the son of man that man having been taken into the word and receiving the adoption might become the son of god
7979651 he will judge also the ebionites for how can they be saved unless it was god who wrought out their salvation upon earth or how shall man pass into god unless god has first passed into man
7979652 the leaven of deification mad human flesh a new mixture and the intellect upon receiving this leaven was mingled with god and deified through divinity
7979653 since man did not become god god himself became man in order to reconstruct what was given through what is assumed
7979654 he came forth then as god with that which he had assumed one person in two natures flesh and spirit of which the latter deified the former
7979655 and christ bearing a body was no less god for he was not lessened by the envelopment of the body but rather deified it and rendered it immortal
7979656 therefore he was not man and then became god but he was god and then became man and that to deify us
7979657 whence if he was himself too from participation and not from the father his essential godhead and image he would not deify being deified himself
7979658 that is in the age to come man he is changed and to complete the mystery becomes deified by merely inclining himself towards god becoming deified
7979659 for both natures are one by the combination the deity being made man and the manhood deified or however one should express it
7979660 for it was right that the flesh should be moved but subject to the divine will according to the most wise athanasius
7979661 i came down from heaven not that i might do mine own will but the will of the father which sent me
7979662 his will i e the saviours is not contrary to god but altogether deified
7979663 part of the plot as it said in the script was that this event would be used to start an international war on terror
7979664 hoy hay m s necesidad de hacer que la pareja sea como una peque a empresa de la cual hay que ocuparse
7979665 cada pareja es un mundo cada pareja es una situaci n nueva y cada pareja maneja las dificultades de los intercambios en funci n de sus posibilidades
7979666 fui d ndome cuenta de que las personas se comportaban de manera diferente cuando estaban entre dos o m s personas presentes que cuando se trabajaba en an lisis individual en que el paciente se aislaba en su mundo interno entonces poco a poco empec a trabajar tambi n con parejas y familias
7979667 vi que una cosa era hablar en una sesi n individual del marido o de la esposa ausente y tener di logos como entonces me enoj porque ella o l me dijo tal cosa y yo le contest tal otra que son una especie de mon logos porque se cuenta todo desde una nica perspectiva y otra cosa es cuando esa misma persona se encuentra con el otro real en un sicoan lisis de pareja ah resulta que no puede tener el mismo discurso porque el otro le dice no es as o yo pienso de otra manera da su opini n y la posibilidad de acceso al conflicto de la pareja se transforma en algo m s vital o en algo que los saca del mundo interno y les permite darse cuenta de qu les pasa cuando est n con otro
7979668 cada vez m s parejas est n dispuestas a hacerse un an lisis porque empiezan a saber que con echarle la culpa al otro no resuelven sus problemas y tienen ganas de estar juntos pero no saben c mo hacerlo
7979669 creen equivocadamente que como conviven se conocen o sea que pierden la curiosidad por el otro la curiosidad por lo desconocido del otro y despu s se aburren estando juntos muchas veces las parejas creen que una vez que se casaron se acab el problema de trabajar de hacer algo con el otro porque ya tienen el contrato es como si usted habitara en un departamento en una casa y el d a que la compr y se instal dejara de ocuparse de ella cree que no la tiene que limpiar no la tiene que cuidar que no se va a estropear y va a tener siempre el mismo gusto si usted habita una pareja vive en lo que ser a el contrato matrimonial todos los d as tiene que hacer algo para que esa pareja est bien vital limpia si usted va a un trabajo todos los d as tiene que aprender algo si usted tiene una profesi n como la m a todos los d as tiene que leer algo para mantener su profesi n con vida uno no puede decir le un libro hace mucho tiempo y me alcanza para toda la vida es un disparate lo mismo digo para las parejas
7979670 cuando uno reprocha sirve para decir que el problema lo tiene el otro y mi idea es que el problema nunca es de uno sino que de la pareja de lo que hacen entre los dos entonces reducir todo a que el problema es del otro es anular la riqueza de la din mica de una vida de pareja
7979671 cuando las mujeres dicen mi marido no me ayuda con los ni os ellas hablan como si fueran due as de los hijos dicen que l puede ayudar pero que los hijos son suyos eso por ejemplo es algo que se ve en un sicoan lisis de pareja por qu los hijos son suyos por qu el marido va a ayudar no es algo que tienen que hacer juntos si los hijos son de los dos
7979672 las parejas ya no tienen como anta o distribuidos los roles en funci n de la identidad de g nero sino en funci n de las posibilidades de cada uno por ese motivo la vida en com n comporta decisiones que no deben estabilizarse sino que hay que renegociar o volver a pensar y volver a decidir no porque yo haya hecho hoy algo ma ana voy a tener las mismas ganas de hacerlo
7979673 hoy en d a hay m s necesidad de hacer que la pareja sea como una peque a empresa de la cual hay que ocuparse el tema econ mico el tema del trabajo el hecho que haya menos ayuda de la que hab a antes para tener hijos y para organizar la casa hace que haya m s necesidad de colaboraci n y con situaciones a veces complejas a veces no es divertido cocinar todos los d as pero hay que hacerlo a veces no es divertido cumplir horario con los chicos pero hay que hacerlo hoy d a hay dificultades de la vida cotidiana que hay que enfrentar pero tambi n hay m s riqueza en las posibilidades de vida
7979674 hay que poder incorporar la idea que vivimos con incertidumbre y que la vida de la relaci n es siempre sorpresiva no se sabe qu talentos o necesidades o gustos cada uno va a desarrollar y si las diferencias entre cada uno van a seguir siendo compatibles lo que tal vez pase hoy es que ya no es tanto drama pensar en separarse y formar nuevas familias

7979680 maybe i do wear more white during the day but thats because its hot
7979681 cupiano came on because he doesnt care he knows he is getting re elected anyway the rest are just following orders
7979682 probably not a good idea for me with the red wolf going on and all i thought you guys would be able to smell it
7979683 the governor believes that californians ought to have an opportunity to vote on all these measures

7979688 de teams van het instituut hebben de zone ge dentificeerd van waar de uitgestoten jodium afkomstig is het filtersysteem is in de loop van maandag versterkt en de toestand is zich aan het normaliseren de uitstoot van jodium is de voorbije 24 uren consequent verminderd in de loop van de komende uren kan een volledige terugkeer naar de normale toestand verwacht worden
7979689 want het niveau van de jodiumuitstooot komt overeen met enkele tienden van de wettelijke limiet

7979695 1 corinthians 14 34 35 does it mean woman cant teach preach or speak in church
7979696 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you travel land and sea to win one proselyte and when he is won you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves
7979697 woe to you blind guides who say whoever swears by the temple it is nothing but whoever swears by the gold of the temple he is obliged to perform it
7979698 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish but inside they are full of extortion and self indulgence 26 blind pharisee first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish that the outside of them may be clean also
7979699 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly but inside are full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness 28 even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness

7979706 is inconsistent with your stations obligations under federal communications commission regulations
7979707 how much do your really know about barack obama what does he really believe
7979708 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7979709 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7979710 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
7979711 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
7979712 not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
7979713 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
7979714 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
7979715 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters
7979716 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem

7979734 we must hold fast to this that no proper sacrifice to god could have been offered unless christ disregarding his own feelings subjected and yielded himself wholly to his fathers will
7979735 when it is asked then how christ by abolishing sin removed the enmity between god and us and purchased a righteousness which made him favorable and kind to us it may be answered generally that he accomplished this by the whole course of his obedience
7979736 as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous
7979737 when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law
7979738 in the confession of faith called the apostles creed the transition is admirably made from the birth of christ to his death and resurrection in which the completion of a perfect salvation consists still there is no exclusion of the other part of obedience which he performed in life thus paul comprehends from the beginning even to the end his having assumed the form of a servant humbled himself and become obedient to death even the death of the cross philippians 2 7 and indeed the first step in obedience was his voluntary subjection for the sacrifice would have been unavailing to justification if not offered spontaneously
7979739 my servant that we may not only view him as god but may contemplate his human nature in which he performed that obedience by which we are acquitted before god

7979778 barack obama is not and has never been a muslim
7979779 my father was from kenya a lot of people in his village were muslim he didnt practice islam truth is he wasnt very religious
7979780 they married and then divorced i was raised by my mother so ive always been a christian the only connection ive had to islam is that my grandfather on my fathers side came from that country but ive never practiced islam for a while i lived in indonesia because my mother was teaching there and thats a muslim country and i went to school but i didnt practice islam
7979781 his former roman catholic and muslim teachers along with two people who were identified by obamas grade school teacher as childhood friends says obama was registered by his family as a muslim at both schools he attended the registration meant that during the third and fourth grades obama learned about islam for two hours each week in religion classes the childhood friends say obama sometimes went to friday prayers at the local mosque
