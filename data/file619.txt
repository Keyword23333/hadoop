6190000 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth
6190001 we are right on track with where we were last year with occupancy and left to lease even our down markets were not as down in the second quarter this year as those of our competitors
6190002 effective revenue management strategy backed up by a solid system forces a management process that prevents over correcting in leaner times it has helped us in boom times too when managers might have been content with good occupancy and perhaps were slow to push rents higher
6190003 the b product is still a fairly safe place to be even though were seeing rent growth flatten in some markets
6190004 we are carefully watching all our markets continuing to do acquisitions and working to maximize occupancy and maximize revenue
6190005 an important value of using lease rent optimization technology is that it requires we track competitors and watch our renewals more carefully so we can generate daily rents more in tune with our markets it also stabilizes our renewal pace
6190006 people mistakenly believe that when you implement a revenue management system you flip a few switches and everyone turns off their brains
6190007 laramars pricing optimization system requires that our entire team be more engaged with the market and our strategies on a daily basis
6190008 we track our results every year against industry advisers reit indexes and have consistently beat the reit revenue growth numbers every year
6190009 i attribute that almost 100 percent to the lro system we were 80 percent committed to it when we did the system pilot test study and we are 110 percent committed to it now lease rent optimization technology is an integral part of our business practices regardless of market conditions

6190080 you never want to go into someone elses place and cause any embarrassment
6190081 what was so galling about watching w s giddy sightseeing at the olympics was that it underscored chinas rise as a superpower and thanks to the administrations derelict foreign and economic policies americas fade out amp while america has been bogged down and bled dry china and russia are plumping up china has bought so much of america that wed be dead peking ducks if they pulled their investments out of our market
6190082 intuitively and ecologically this combination is a recipe for disaster we ask you to intervene to protect our water supply
6190083 the state balanced the costs and the benefits and decided to issue the waiver there is a feeling that massachusetts should deal with massachusetts trash and not ship it out of state there is not much landfill capacity left in massachusetts we are providing a regional public service
6190084 yes we get some financial benefit probably around 800 000 a year with the host community fee and other payments from the solid waste enterprise fund but within the total 72 million dollar municipal budget that is a very small percentage were not doing this for the money
6190085 yes that would be accurate we have been able to keep tipping fees relatively stable over the years for towns in western massachusetts if there wasnt a publicly owned regional facility then all facilities would be run by private waste hauling or private landfill companies which would create a kind of unfair market practice we run the landfill as a municipal enterprise fund were not in it to make a huge profit
6190086 so mr laurila can you tell me why the zone ii waiver was granted
6190087 the dep granted the zone ii waiver largely on the basis of the contaminant transport model
6190088 the city paid to have the model independently reviewed by consultants of easthamptons choosing it was amended to incorporate new information about the aquifer the model was reviewed and approved by the dep
6190089 the model predicts near total attenuation of any chemical contaminant from landfill leachate by the time groundwater reaches the maloney well all five chemicals used in the study returned values below detectable limits there is no potential contamination of the maloney well from the landfill
6190090 and you worked on this project on this contaminant transport model
6190091 was he brought on for the express purpose of promoting the landfill expansion might he be biased toward his former colleagues and if the expansion goes through wont stantec be positioned to make a lot of money
6190092 jim like all professional engineers adheres to a strict code of ethics there is no bias in 06 i put together an independent selection committee to find a city engineer i stayed completely out of it laurilas resume rose to the top i was surprised that he had even applied i interviewed three candidates and hired him there are quality of life issues that prompt people to move into the public sector stantec competes for contracts in the same way that any other engineering firm does they won the phase 5 phase 5b design contract in an open bidding process theres no guarantee that they will win additional contracts if the landfill is expanded
6190093 but if the expansion is quashed nobody makes any money
6190094 there would be plenty of closure compliance and monitoring work not as much work as there would be with an expansion but plenty of work nonetheless
6190095 stantec hydroanalysis the dep and the department of public works the city council and the mayor are all in favor the board of public works is pretending to be neutral but theyve made up their minds a long time ago they all know what the answer is going to be the contaminant transport model just serves to justify their position it got them the waiver thats science that was bought and paid for
6190096 we work with some of the best scientists and engineers in the business you can be assured that the science used in developing the model is of the highest quality the state would not have granted the waiver if there were any doubt at all about the safety of the maloney well
6190097 if you had been hired by the opposition would you have constructed your model differently i do not mean to question your character i am just curious
6190098 as a general matter developing a ground water model is a technically unforgiving exercise if it is not developed correctly it will not match the field data it really is not possible to construct a model differently and still hope to have a model that passes the test of matching field data
6190099 back to your original question note that to some extent we were hired by the opposition our original model although contracted by the city of northampton was prepared to determine a zone ii for the city of easthampton and subject to review by dep as such it needed to be satisfactory to those two parties and easthampton would need to endorse the report to use the zone ii we approached the model no differently than we had any other of our prior zone ii models
6190100 there are two parts to the model the groundwater flow model which determined the zone ii and the contaminant transport element
6190101 the dep actually rejected the original groundwater flow model issuing a technical deficiency report
6190102 the model was an important consideration but not the only one
6190103 the permitting process is far from over the city must yet obtain from the dep an authorization to construct atc and an authorization to operate ato they have yet to address all the requirements of the waiver for instance they have not yet submitted the required contingency plan the zone ii waiver simply gives them permission to begin an extensive process
6190104 if youre making a decision based on a model you are going to be making potentially the wrong decision
6190105 the landfill represents a liability clean water is our most precious resource and we can no longer take it for granted i believe that because of where the landfill is located in a primary recharge area you can never let contaminants escape as you build up the waste in the landfill its got to be preserved forever not 50 years not a hundred years but forever we all know thats not going to happen remediation will be needed which will be very expensive what i fear is that the cost of expanding the landfill will ultimately be borne by our children
6190106 why do you think the dep granted northampton the zone ii site assignment waiver
6190107 jurisdiction necessary to ensure that providers of telecommunications for internet access amp operate in a neutral manner
6190108 ensure that broadband networks are amp open affordable and accessible to all consumers
6190109 comcast corp s management of its broadband internet networks contravenes federal policies that protect the vibrant and open nature of the internet
6190110 concluded that comcast has unduly interfered with internet users right to access the lawful internet content and to use the applications of their choice specifically comcast had deployed equipment throughout its network to monitor the content of its customers internet connections and selectively block specific types of connections known as peer to peer connections
6190111 our target is to acquire a minimum of four exhibition brands each year in fact three will be acquired by mid march 2008
6190112 no region was immune to price increases as airfares to asia australia central america south america and europe all experienced double digit growth
6190113 with global economies continuing to develop and expand demand for international business travel has remained high
6190114 travelers heeded the call to book their trips further in advance by taking advantage of lower advance purchase fares
6190115 meanwhile the continued expansion of low fare models was counter balanced by a slowdown in network airlines capacity growth causing the net dollar reduction in year over year domestic airfares
6190116 after three quarters of strong growth the metrics for the exhibition industry softened in the fourth quarter of 2007 and for the first time in several years underperformed the same quarter of the previous year
6190117 most forecasters predict that the second half of 2008 will show marked economic improvement and growth
6190118 my guitar looks as if it were noisy furniture and i would grab it and force my fingers into a song i always found the courage to muster this one show a year though although for some of those 24 it was a painful rebirth
6190119 came about two inches from being a tv show executively produced by mike scully of the simpsons
6190120 last year we were able to underwrite the teen art exhibit at artspace in greenfield and generously support the avenue a music project at the brick house in turners falls for example
6190121 so we feel this is a win win as it supports a good cause and still carries on nicks name through music
6190122 with the economy in a state of flux it is critical for industry executives to be armed with solid data to help them plan for the short and long term and reforecast when economic conditions take a turn
6190123 concerns over war terrorism rising oil prices and overextended consumers calling it quits to spending
6190124 im paul ws anderson i know movies i bang le loo i wish critics stopped calling me the shitty anderson i wish
6190125 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think we will have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell
6190126 at least senator mccain is being honest a vote for him is a vote for the draft period unless senator mccain radically changes his worldview there would be a draft to implement his plans
6190127 when you take into account his indefinite military commitment to iraq his desire to send more troops to afghanistan record lows in recruiting and retention and possibly more wars he is looking to get into like
6190128 nullification is a legal theory that a u s state has the right to nullify or invalidate any federal law which that state has deemed unconstitutional
6190129 without showing any evidence of suspicion of wrongdoing to a court of law our mission is to let people have a free exchange of information and free access to information without feeling that someones looking over their shoulder
6190130 how horrible a terrorist attack is amp but to me the terrorists win if we give up what makes this country what it is
6190131 we wanted to protect patrons privacy because these letters came with no court order
6190132 if they were using the letters to pursue terrorists why were they afraid to go to a court to get an order and we wanted people to know that this sort of spying was going on
6190133 we thought civil liberties had been restored but there is no way to win if you do contest the letters
6190134 and librarians face a five year prison term if they do speak about it
6190135 he wanted to have some type of animal not a dog
6190136 i kind of had a problem with that because it didnt seem like i could hide a dog
6190137 this is a great opportunity for industry and government to work collaboratively on consistent standards
6190138 we feel that there will be a strong incentive for service and facility providers to adopt the green meeting standards into their business practice
6190139 this will be the case as the government is one of the largest consumers of meetings services in the country and intends to adopt the standards as a measuring stick in making their spend decisions
6190140 the name of our center is composed of two nahuatl words
6190141 the cheap punk lowest form of life on earth club
6190142 it is the annual canadian mineral exploration conference it is a big deal
6190143 weve been using macs and final cut pro for about 4 years now
6190144 this is the first time were actually using it at the games and its by far our largest olympics support team we sent around 200 people to beijing including camera operators reporters editors graphic artists and engineers
6190145 for hong kong were providing promo content on four different channels all derived from our hd 1080 50i masters
6190146 the jade channel and j2 are cantonese language channels currently broadcasting about 70 percent olympics programming hd jade our 24 hour high definition channel that started broadcasting earlier this year is showing 100 percent olympics content finally our pearl channel provides english language programming
6190147 our market share is a little over 80 percent of the 7 million total viewers in hong kong
6190148 in addition to hong kong our signal is seen in much of southern china in the guangdong province its also syndicated to cantonese speaking viewers in chinese communities worldwide including those in the united states and canada
6190149 we selected prores as our high definition editorial and playout format after testing several different codecs
6190150 we like prores because it gives us excellent image quality with a manageable file size and data rate this is essential for artists and editors to share projects
6190151 in addition to final cut pro we also use soundtrack pro
6190152 for certain types of sound effects in our spots we used to have to take a completed version onto a dub stage that meant passing our work off to another team and then waiting now we can do the same work ourselves using filters in soundtrack pro so its gotten a lot easier and faster
6190153 if im editing in final cut pro on one mac pro chan wai yin can be doing graphics for me on another and we can share the project that cuts our production time in half sometimes the delivery schedule is so fast we barely have time to keep everything organized the finder in leopard is very helpful for this reason we can use cover flow to quickly search through media just like you would on itunes
6190154 the performance is very solid across the network and its much faster than the tape based systems weve worked with in the past
6190155 we put the raids through a weeks worth of testing in hong kong before preparing them to ship to beijing and had no problems at all
6190156 in hong kong most of the artists are using macs in college so its easier to adopt
6190157 at this point we dont have to do much in house training we look at a prospective editors resume and if they know how to use the mac and final cut studio we already know we can potentially work with them
6190158 is a known iphone bug that is being fixed in the next software update in september

6190168 georgia is nothing more than a u s aircraft carrier the united states still thinks in cold war paradigms and frankly has learned nothing in the last 20 years
6190169 the united states will suffer long term it might not seem like that now but trust me people remember the u s was nowhere to be seen in berlin in 53 in hungary in 56 and czechoslovakia in 68 it is all talk and no action
6190170 many now see the united states as a friend incapable of delivering
6190171 like the monroe doctrine russia wants to keep an eye on her backyard the united states is mistaken to underestimate her will to do this
6190172 the air travel crisis has hit a tipping point more than 100 000 travelers each day are voting with their wallets by choosing to avoid trips
6190173 this landmark research should be a wake up call to americas policy leaders that the time for meaningful air system reform is now
6190174 one of the benefits of the vehicles is that they dont contribute to traffic noise
6190175 i would not have nominated uhhh clarence thomas uh i dont think that uhhh i i i i i i dont think that he was an exper uh a strong enough jurist or legal thinker uh at the time uh for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6190176 i am by nature a marketer we want to grow the association and go in some different strategic directions
6190177 we welcome margit and are looking for great organizational advancement under her leadership
6190178 her knowledge of the trade show industry promises to send tsea in exciting new directions and make it even more effective and responsive to our members
6190179 the most important piece of information is that you communicate your goal or message that you are trying to achieve for your organization
6190180 if a client is just shopping for numbers please let the vendor know for example if you have to get three quotes to satisfy by laws of a board or committee then please let the vendor know so they do not spend hours of labor and money on something that will never come their way
6190181 for some reason some clients feel that financial information should be confidential but in reality by sharing this with your prospective vendor you are giving them better information which can only result in a better and more concise proposal of services back to you
6190182 a vendor who knows the true value of your event can offer you a greater amount of incentives and can propose a scenic element of solution that fits within your budget constraints not one that exceeds them and places that vendor out of the running
6190183 an easy way to provide your budget figure is to send last years invoice to your new vendor sans the pricing of course or i tell them i will white it out for them if they like and give them a ballpark budget to go along with this
6190184 the value of a proposition reflects the likelihood it will become true
6190185 the price is the percent chance that something will happen
6190186 we are so impressed and thrilled with everything phoenix has done all the science they have accomplished is fantastic

6190209 lo que el gobierno debe comprender es que el precedente es seg n el cristal con el cual se mira
6190210 no podemos decidir c mo reacciona la gente a lo que nosotros hacemos

6190213 barrooms face their own little challenges of people understanding why theyre legitimate

6190223 dat 500 mensen sterven en dat niemand ervan weet toont aan dat de offici le instellingen betrokken zijn bij deze moorden maar de waarheid verborgen willen houden de slachtoffers vertonen allemaal schotwonden aan het hoofd en zijn dus ge xecuteerd bovendien heeft de politie nog geen onderzoek opgestart naar deze zaak vijfhonderd doden in vier maanden is niet normaal en doet vermoeden dat de keniaanse politie achter dit voorval zit
6190224 wine is so homogenous these days i like things that stand out

6190253 eu n o acho que ele vai quebrar o meu recorde mundial em pequim
6190254 bolt n o tinha resist ncia suficiente para manter seu sprint por toda a prova
6190255 esse recorde mundial essa prova tudo muito especial eu amo os 200 m algo que come ou quando eu tinha 15 anos e fui o mais jovem da hist ria a conquistar o t tulo mundial j nior daquele dia em diante os 200 m viraram a minha prova aquela que eu guardo com mais carinho
6190256 a vit ria nos 100 m foi o feito mais impressionante no atletismo que eu presenciei em toda a minha vida eu esperava que ele vencesse n o esperava que ele fizesse o que fez
6190257 eu n o ficaria surpreso ou chocado se ele batesse o meu recorde mas acho que n o acontecer aqui para correr em 19s30 exatamente o tempo marcado por bolt na final preciso correr a curva melhor e manter a velocidade por mais tempo

6190262 the caa has made great strides in basketball over the past several years and we think the addition of katie will allow us to build on that success
6190263 conditions have changed dramatically so im not saying that anyone would be forced to do anything but at the same time theres already been discussion among the western states
6190264 on a year in year out basis theres probably no issue more important to the west than water
6190265 youve got to be very careful with it its terribly sensitive for obvious reasons
6190266 itll spark problems in colorado when someone in arizona talks about revisiting things
6190267 thats generally interpreted as meaning that arizona wants more of colorados water
6190268 would never damage the state of colorados rights over the water
6190269 in a purple state like colorado republicans cant afford those
6190270 we dont vote for water rustlers thieves in this state we tar and feather them
6190271 for mccain to suggest particularly on the heels of last years renegotiation of the compact that we keep talking about it whatever he meant it struck me as more than just a small misstep
6190272 senator mccain believes as i do that a compact thats been worked out between the governors and between the states is the right way to go
6190273 scientists have predicted a 10 to 30 reduction of water flow in the colorado river due to long term drought and higher temperatures associated with climate change
6190274 it would be better to help states and communities with water conservation projects and stream restoration

6190278 en un contexto evolucionista y expon an un nuevo concepto en biolog a
6190279 la clase de formas y espacios que surgen como subproductos necesarios de otra decisi n en dise o y no como adaptaciones tiles en s mismas
6190280 vrba y yo propusimos que los rasgos co optados para una utilidad actual subsiguiente a un origen para una funci n distinta o inexistente recibieran el nombre de exaptaciones esto es tiles aptus como consecuencia de ex su forma en contraste con las adaptaciones o rasgos directamente construidos para su utilidad actual
6190281 la mayor a de los caracoles tienen una enjuta formada por el espacio que existe alrededor del eje de la concha qu permite que algunas especies la usen para alimentar sus huevos son m s listas o m s diestras no su anatom a y su sistema nervioso se han transformado de manera adaptativa para aprovecharse de la enjuta as quien re usa y co opta no es otra que la selecci n natural hemos evolucionado de organismos sin ojos pies y otros rganos complejos los rganos se tienen que haber originado de precursores que eran enjutas para alg n organismo ancestral
6190282 pinker confunde las enjutas con el cambio funcional un concepto resaltado por el mismo darwin y que a menudo se identifica con el desafortunado y confuso nombre de preadaptaci n las estructuras que evolucionan como adaptaciones para una funci n a menudo se co optan para una funci n diferente en un linaje descendiente en el cl sico ejemplo las plumas evolucionaron para termorregulaci n en peque os dinosaurios y fueron m s tarde co optadas para el vuelo en las aves no creo que los ojos y las piernas aparecieran como enjutas sino que surgieron para una funci n y fueron co optadas para otra mientras que las enjutas surgen no adaptativamente y despu s pueden ser cooptadas para una utilidad posterior
6190283 we have to consistently remind people of the same message because they will forget
6190284 but we also found there are some people out there with irrigation systems that are computer controlled regardless of the weather outside

6190289 und wenn darin fehler sind so sind es die fehler eines menschen aber siehe wir wissen von keinem fehler doch gott wei alles darum wenn jemand verurteilt soll er sich vorsehen da ihm nicht das feuer der h lle droht
6190290 und wer diesen bericht empf ngt und ihn nicht wegen der unvollkommenheiten verwirft die darinnen sind der wird von gr eren dingen wissen als diesen siehe ich bin moroni und wenn es m glich w re w rde ich euch alles kundtun
6190291 ich habe nicht feststellen k nnen da es ein diamant ist
6190292 darum empfinden die schuldigen die wahrheit als hart denn sie ctrifft sie bis tief ins innerste
6190293 nicht so m chtig im schreiben wie im sprechen denn wenn jemand durch die macht des heiligen geistes spricht so tr gt die macht des heiligen geistes es den menschenkindern ins herz
6190294 und es spricht von jesus und bewegt sie an ihn zu glauben und bis ans ende auszuharren und das ist ewiges leben und es spricht sich scharf gegen die s nde aus gem der klarheit dessen was wahr ist darum wird niemand wegen der worte z rnen die ich geschrieben habe au er er sei vom geist des teufels das neue testament enth lt eine warnung die wir uns zu herzen nehmen sollten petrus und die brigen apostel waren vom sanhedrin gefangengenommen worden sie wurden von einem engel befreit mu ten sich aber ein zweites mal vor demselben rat verantworten sie bezeugten zeugen dieser ereignisse sind wir und der heilige geist den gott allen verliehen hat die ihm gehorchen da erhob sich im hohen rat ein pharis er namens gamali l ein beim ganzen volk angesehener gesetzeslehrer er lie die apostel f r kurze zeit hinausf hren dann sagte er israeliten berlegt euch gut was ihr mit diesen leuten tun wollt er nannte dann als beispiel zwei prediger die umgekommen waren und alle die ihnen zufielen sind zerstreut
6190295 darum rate ich euch jetzt lasst von diesen m nnern ab und gebt sie frei denn wenn dieses vorhaben oder dieses werk von menschen stammt wird es zerst rt werden stammt es aber von gott so k nnt ihr sie nicht vernichten sonst werdet ihr noch als k mpfer gegen gott dastehen
6190296 wahrlich so spricht der herr es wird sich begeben jede seele die von ihren s nden l t und zu mir kommt und meinen namen anruft und meiner stimme gehorcht und meine gebote h lt wird mein angesicht sehen und wissen da ich bin
6190297 damit euer sinn nur auf gott gerichtet sei dann werden die tage kommen da ihr ihn sehen werdet denn er wird f r euch den schleier von seinem angesicht nehmen und es wird zu seiner eigenen zeit sein und auf seine eigene weise und gem seinem eigenen willen

6190300 we dont have any problems with it its emissions are very low we dont get complaints a lot of people dont even know it is there
6190301 it has to meet the strictest standards in the world and be carefully operated and monitored
6190302 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of
6190303 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6190304 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6190305 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6190306 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6190307 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6190308 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6190309 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6190310 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6190311 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities
6190312 if youre out there crapping in your pants youre not going to do very well
6190313 if youre out there confident and know what youre doing and know that no one is going to block you then youre going to make all of the tackles that you can you can play really well
6190314 always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6190315 but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6190316 hes so busy im sure not even his agent can get a hold of him
6190317 this is an image that our readers and others will remember
6190318 the juggernaut and the ninth inning home run with two outs and two strikes
6190319 ive got three applications on my iphone right now that dont work apple killed the netshare application why did that do that is apple enforcing at amp t s terms of service i didnt sign a contract with apple that allows them to do that
6190320 let me buy what i want and its my problem if i run afoul of at amp t
6190321 the implications are a falling stock price thats what they are afraid of
6190322 lets say apple sold 2 5 million iphone 3gs theyd better make 2 5 million iphones with a fix in it before they announce the recall because you are going to have 2 5 million people wanting another iphone theyd better have them in stock
6190323 a social tale that can be related to historical tales without losing its poetic power
6190324 although it is unlikely that women as old as ms wu and ms wang would be forced into hard labor many of those sentenced to laojiao often toil in agricultural or factory work and are forced to confess their transgressions
6190325 it resembled a brothel the girls were paraded before the arab who would lift the girls burqa run his fingers through their hair gaze at their figures and converse through an interpreter
6190326 why is it up to me as a councillor to be releasing information about this
6190327 why isnt farmtech or the ministry making people aware of this this is supposed to be an open public process but it seems like there is a concerted attempt to keep this under the radar and manage public reaction
6190328 particulate matter products of combustion such as carbon monoxide sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides volatile organic compounds such as acetaldehyde acrolein and benzene odour and noise
6190329 all new industry must meet stringent requirements for emissions as set out in the certificate of approval by ontarios ministry of environment
6190330 farmtech will operate well within legal limits for emissions as set out by the province of ontario
6190331 if this is just going to appear on this one website only the absolute keeners are going to see it and get to comment
6190332 what about everyone else for a company that claims it does everything above board this seems like a sneaky way of doing things
6190333 its up to the proponent to notify stakeholders and the public and decide how theyre going to do that
6190334 even more sad this week a hefty faction on the left primarily independent booksellers following barnes and nobles lead is actively boycotting a brave attempt to bring the book publishing industry into the 21st century and effectively trying to keep a progressive pro obama and fact based title called obamas challenge out of the marketplace of ideas
6190335 i hate to tell you indie booksellers but this isnt just about business its about activism and defeating the right and getting our messages and ideas out in the most effective ways possible its about not shooting ourselves in the proverbial foot again boycotting this book is a mistake and you know it instead of looking backward find ways to advance your own innovative models and pod services with publishers and the public
6190336 i know of everything within the spectrum seeing as im sort of in charge of it

6190373 georgia has also sent troops to afghanistan and iraq to help others realize the blessings of liberty georgia stood for freedom around the world
6190374 we think that it our draft is a straightforward thing and we see no reason why members of the security council could not approve or endorse the six principles which were annunciated by the presidents of russia and france and which form the basis of the current effort to resolve and normalize the situation
6190375 this draft resolution is intended to rubber stamp a russian interpretation that we do not agree with
6190376 we do have an agreement it has been signed it is not being implemented the security council adopting a resolution repeating it is not going to change the facts either the russian federation will comply with its obligations as a party to this conflict or a resolution that reiterates those points if they are not going to be compliant is not worthy of the security council

6190382 we recognize that in america this is going after somebody who is more comfortable with technology
6190383 the truth is that in other countries its becoming a part of their culture the trend is coming and as a fashion company its very important to identify trends and get ahead of them
6190384 this is about someone whos interested in our brand and interested in technology and wherever the two meet thats whats appropriate

6190388 my friends we have to have nuclear power nuclear power has got to be part of any way of us being energy independent
6190389 the bottom line i think at this stage is too close to call
6190390 we do not know who is going to win but i think we certainly know the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case

6190400 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6190401 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6190402 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country

6190408 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
6190409 wouldnt even allow protests in their own designated protest zones in beijing protests that couldnt possibly have hurt anyone
6190410 there used to be some sensitive events and days when we would be watched such as june 4th
6190411 but now its happening more and more it seems to me that extra sensitivity will continue after the olympics
6190412 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released
6190413 i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again

6190421 we left 12 men on base we had all kinds of chances to win the game and we couldnt get it done i dont have to say nothing to them on a night like this i dont have to say a word
6190422 we are delighted beyond words that an operator of excaliburs quality is opening a 100 pokerpro poker room on the strip it is commentary on how far pokertek and automated poker have come in such a short time
6190423 the acceptance of the game has grown substantially in the last year and continues to grow as our footprint expands
6190424 weve opened a successful 20 plus table room in montreal a beautiful 12 table room in michigan a high end 12 table room in atlantic city and now 12 tables in the gaming hub of the world las vegas with more than 230 pokerpro tables currently installed worldwide we are ready for the nevada market
6190425 ive run poker rooms for 20 years and i cant wait for players to see what excalibur and pokerpro will offer them
6190426 were going to have a great daily tournament schedule tremendous player promotions and more than that well be laying down games that manual rooms just cant for example our pot limit omaha games will be getting out 30 hands per hour that is unheard of for a game as popular as plo and only pokerpro can offer that kind of speed
6190427 i am so excited that automated poker is finally going to exist in vegas
6190428 pokerpro is an amazing way to play the game the speed and accuracy beats any manual table you will find me in the excaliburs poker room from time to time and i challenge all poker players to try this
6190429 oh it looks like a little newborn baby all swadled up burrito style
6190430 oh her kids are getting a bit older now things are running fairly smoothly these days she can get out of the house without a diaper bag full of the necessities for a newborn she gets to sleep through the night no nursing sessions every 2 hours each and every day why would she want to add another baby into the mix to just cause chaos in her already semi chaotic world
6190431 when i took this bread out of the oven today do you know the first thing i thought of
6190432 oh it looks like a little newborn baby all swadled up burrito style
6190433 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6190434 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6190435 us efforts to change the strategic balance of power in its favor
6190436 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic means
6190437 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6190441 we used to meet him there in the past but with no official duties he was completely different
6190442 it is time to put the pervez musharraf phenomena behind us
6190443 a failure to hold musharraf and the army responsible will only result in those abuses continuing and hamper pakistans development into a full democracy
6190444 if this does not work our people will follow him musharraf wherever he goes and whenever they find a chance theyll kill him or get hold of him alive
6190445 for clearing the area of the terrorists if it just so happened that somebody else was there and he was killed he cant be held responsible for murder
6190446 hell play a lot of golf hes very social he knows a lot of people hes a member of all the clubs in karachi

6190546 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6190547 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6190548 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6190549 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6190550 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

6190553 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6190554 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6190555 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6190556 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6190560 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6190561 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6190562 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6190563 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6190564 then jet took him down and said wake up wake up wake up

6190567 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6190568 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6190569 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6190570 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6190571 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services

6190574 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

6190576 foreclosure on wheels long beachs truck program puts drivers at high risk for default
6190577 the current sub prime mortgage debacle illustrates how many institutions profit by enticing minority and low income borrowers with schemes using too easy credit to finance purchases with loans they are unable to repay we ask daimlers corporate officials to show their commitment to socially responsible business practices by abandoning this risky dangerous venture if not for the sake of daimler shareholders and their companys image then for the sake of the truck drivers and their communities
6190578 instead of trying to help residents and workers a public government entity has outrageously teamed up with daimler mercedes to hoodwink the hard working drivers who haul cargo from our shores to americas stores
6190579 we believe that there is an undeniable link between clean air efficient port operations and fairly paid employee drivers achieving the environmental goals requires shifting the responsibility to where it rightfully belongs to a stable accountable and asset based trucking industry
6190580 these kinds of discriminatory loans wont just affect the thousands of californias port drivers as individual borrowers but entire families and their futures as well the companies that profit from global trade are in a financially more stable position to invest in the new clean technology we need to keep our communities healthy low wage workers arent

6190582 today we have gone to court to seek an end to decades of inadequate and unequal funding the state of illinois has given our schools
6190583 our children especially african americans and latinos have been left behind because of poorly funded schools while their white counterparts in wealthy communities are thriving their basic right to a quality education is being denied through our litigation and civic engagement around this issue we want to make sure no more children are given a second class education
6190584 unbalanced and unfair school funding is hurting children all over the state of illinois
6190585 illinois ranks 49th in the nation for the funding gap between rich and poor students and white and minority students
6190586 it should come as no surprise that illinois also ranks near last for the achievement gap between these groups of students
6190587 illinois schoolchildren will be asked to compete globally for the high tech jobs of the 21st century how many of them will be left behind
6190588 no matter your race gender or economic status students receiving low quality education affects all of us an underfunded system leads to low quality education and underachieving students a childs limitation should only be how big they can dream not which school district they happen to live in this vicious cycle must end now

6190590 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6190591 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6190598 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6190599 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6190600 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6190601 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6190602 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6190603 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6190604 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6190605 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6190606 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6190607 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6190608 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6190609 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6190610 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6190611 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6190612 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6190613 who are open to doing something on the production side
6190614 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6190615 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6190616 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6190617 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6190618 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6190619 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6190620 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6190621 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6190622 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6190623 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6190624 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6190625 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6190626 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6190627 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6190628 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6190629 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6190630 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6190631 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6190632 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6190633 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6190634 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6190635 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6190636 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6190637 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6190638 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6190639 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6190640 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6190641 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6190642 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6190643 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6190644 in the most public manner and by the united voice of the confederacy
6190645 i was in line for about three hours trying to get it registered the clerk had to call concord to figure out how to do it
6190646 i thought it was a good way to cut down on gas if i go out on errands or for deliveries i use the zap and save a lot of money
6190647 i think people who were giving are having it just as hard now
6190648 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6190649 hes just a great guy hes awesome and really really talented
6190650 when we play amphitheaters well run up and down the stairs
6190651 and all of us all the bands bought bikes and we go mountain biking and well go to amusements parks and things like that
6190652 although i like php i agree the language is only as good as the
6190653 customers find mobile broadband easy to use and install but transmission speeds and to a lesser extent network coverage reduce the initial enjoyment of getting up and running it is in these areas that fixed isps have a distinct advantage and need to concentrate their marketing effort to minimise customer loss
6190654 the fear and uncertainty that some potential new customers have about price
6190655 the reason why the statistics are so alarming is men dont go in for check ups even though oral cancer is more prevalent in the african american community
6190656 by the time we as black men have oral cancer it is advanced
6190657 many of them have insurance and they just dont go either because of fear or preconceived notions or complete ignorance about what goes on in a dentists office
6190658 see how things work and how much better it is they realize their fears were unwarranted
6190659 that would be an issue his administration would have to face early because hes pledging to be a uniter not a divider without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 hes pledging to change the way washington works and if congress were to pursue that it would be very divisive
6190660 that could be very problematic for his presidency right off the start
6190661 its nice to have fast growing companies but if you cant buy them at the right price it doesnt make sense
6190662 were able to buy many of these companies at a much cheaper rate relative to their growth
6190663 the automotive industry is now focusing on its environmental obligations to reduce co2 emissions and improve efficiencies and we are seeing the high technology capabilities of lotus engineering being in strong demand not only does our brand value of performance through light weight fit perfectly with the necessary direction of the industry to produce lighter more efficient vehicles we are also working on all aspects of future fuels investigating alternative powertrains to accommodate alcohol fuels as they enter the market
6190664 alcohols possess superior combustion characteristics to gasoline which allow greater optimisation taking full advantage of the benefits of sustainable bio alcohols will ensure a greater percentage of vehicle miles will be travelled using renewable fuels we are delighted with the investment from defra which will assist this partnership in taking forward research development and the demonstration of this environmentally conscious transport solution
6190665 it has given us a chance to reflect on how well balanced a country we really are
6190666 they had this idea about nordic people being very reserved and very serious
6190667 i just chose a simpler lifestyle one where i could ride my bike all over and where i dont have to make a great living to survive
6190668 the gist of it is that you dont have to do anything except let go
6190669 its a combination of relaxing eating drinking partying spending time with family
6190670 our neighbors love us for it but they just cant get it
6190671 i dont know where im going to get the money for new shoes
6190672 true we never have all the facts when doing a case study but it is instructive to imagine ourselves as the executives and board members in a situation and ask ourselves what obvious mistakes we seem to have made what might have been the extenuating circumstances and whether we should really be forgiven for the mistake even given those imagined constraints
6190673 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6190674 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6190675 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6190676 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6190677 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6190678 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6190679 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly can cause reproductive dysfunctions for both teen and adult females spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their
6190680 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6190681 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6190682 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible or dependence

6190684 we have to have the funding for it obviously we dont have it right now were just kind of replacing it as it breaks we do stock some pipe here and there but there are whole streets that need to be done
6190685 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place
6190686 and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6190687 the facts are clear and unfortunately its becoming more and more obvious the status quo is not working america is not a sexually healthy nation for this to change we must acknowledge this reality and embrace the important role condoms play in maintaining ones sexual health
6190688 by drawing attention to this issue on such a grand political and social stage were hoping to give renewed voice and attention to the simple fact that condoms play a critical part in advancing the sexual health of america

6190690 as the american appetite for freedom has grown so too has our penchant for empire
6190691 i never expected this i knew this was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6190692 i am shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6190693 oh lord they say wallace spearmon stepped out the second place guy stepped out well hopefully usain stepped out too so that means ill go home with the gold
6190694 not the way i wanted to go home with it but if two people stepped out hey thats a gold medal for me
6190695 starting to do 400 hurdles i hated it i totally despised it
6190696 i know that i deserved that gold medal and the ncaa they took it
6190697 i was devastated and i didnt let it go until today
6190698 but i came out with the gold and the record i dont believe theres a happier woman on earth than i am right now
6190699 i think the credit goes to the fact we start out competing so young
6190700 i was on a track team when i was 7 years old in jamaica it starts young in jamaica
6190701 i spare you the twists and turns of my cogitations for no conclusion was found on the road to headingly and i ask you to suppose that i soon found out my mistake about the turning and retraced my steps to fernham
6190702 what do you think of the new 80 gb ps3 thats coming out soon

6190704 this grant will allow the station to complete its transition to a digital format and roll out innovative new services
6190705 local productions are an essential component of the stations daily broadcasts and provide area residents with educational and cultural programs that enhance life in upper michigan
6190706 this is a major upgrade for our station and will provide viewers with greater clarity in pictures and sound
6190707 its one thing to have the technical capability to broadcast a national signal in digital
6190708 but the ability to create local content in hd digital is another thing altogether this grant will preserve wnmus ability to bring local content including news and emergency broadcasts to viewers in the upper peninsula
6190709 congressman stupak has a solid understanding of the special needs rural communities face and his support throughout this mandated and costly digital tv transition has been unwavering
6190710 his strong support along with help of many others will make the partnership between wnmu tv and its viewers sustainable well into the future
6190711 increasing vulnerability to hurricanes global warmings wake up call for the gulf and atlantic coasts
6190712 while im not convinced that human caused global warming is the underlying cause there can be little doubt that were currently moving through a period of heavy hurricane activity
6190713 when it comes to what we should do for the coast the analysis in this report make sense whatever one thinks about the causes of major hurricanes
6190714 i do think that rich stupid people should be allowed to build on their own property if they want to
6190715 but when a hurricane wipes away an ocean front mansion the government should send nothing besides a rescue boat and a bill
6190716 this season will see a number of initiatives introduced in the professional and grass roots game
6190717 just because youre grown up doesnt mean you dont need someone to confide in in fact logic dictates that the opposite is true life becomes more complex and difficult as we get older the people that we confide in as adults are very valuable
6190718 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6190742 i was delighted and honoured to initially have been asked by tommy burns to assist him in this position it is a real pleasure and privilege to return to celtic a club which i have a great affection for
6190743 i have enjoyed my time immensely at motherwell and would like to wish everyone at the club all the very best for the future however i am now looking forward to the many challenges which lie ahead at celtic
6190744 i aim to do all i can to ensure that the celtic academy continues to be such a great success and hopefully ensure that we can develop even further and ultimately bring the club more and more on field success through the development of quality young players
6190745 we are delighted to welcome chris back to celtic football club chris knows all about the club and as someone who is highly sought after we are very pleased to have secured his services
6190746 celtic continues to make substantial investment into its youth academy and in recent years has seen the benefits of this investment
6190747 currently players such as stephen mcmanus aiden mcgeady darren odea john kennedy and paul caddis are all featuring in our first team squad we are sure the appointment of chris will ensure that we continue to excel in this area
6190748 chris is someone with tremendous ability and a real passion for the game he has all the knowledge and skills required to ensure that he can make a great impact at the club and i am sure chris will be a very valuable addition to our team
6190749 we are sure the great legacy of the clubs youth development programme which tommy left is in very safe hands through the appointment of chris
6190750 im delighted to be here its a fantastic opportunity and im looking forward to getting started
6190751 the football development manager role has developed because celtic is such a massive club theyre looking to co ordinate all the scouting all the recruitment throughout the club and they have seen me as the person deemed fit enough to take up the position
6190752 ive already met gordon strachan and were looking forward to working together looking for quality players for him in his first team and working with the rest of the team
6190753 there is already a lot of good staff working at the club and were looking to enhance that
6190754 when i joined hibernian in april 1998 it was a great career move for me hibernian is a fantastic club with some great people and the chairmans been brilliant with me all the way along
6190755 now this new role at celtic is another challenge in my career and i think its the right challenge for me
6190756 i am absolutely delighted that john has agreed to join celtic in this new and exciting role it is a major coup for us to have secured his services
6190757 everyone will be aware of his incredible record at hibernian and the terrific work he did in the youth development of the club
6190758 johns main task will be to co ordinate and manage our scouting network throughout the club
6190759 scouting for quality talent is extremely important to a club like celtic when competing at the highest level against clubs with significantly higher football budgets
6190760 john will join ray clarke tom oneill and the rest of the scouting team with the objective of putting celtic at the forefront of identifying talent around europe
6190761 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6190762 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
6190763 its not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered

6190775 we wanted to make sure that the trust factors were in place

6190794 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6190795 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6190796 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6190871 a wonderful book written by doris kearns goodwin called team of rivals in which she talked about how lincoln basically pulled in all the people who had been running against him into his cabinet because whatever you know personal feelings there were the issue was how can we get this country through this time of crisis
6190872 too many blows to the head do you think id let anybody get near enough to mess with this pretty face
6190873 before the fight ali had been boasting how he was too fast for foreman to keep up with him typically ali had set up his opponents through boasting and taunting before a fight he would make fun of an opponent or predict which round he would knock out the opponent the press would eat this up
6190874 alis boasting of his speed and the way he opened the first round of the fight with a flurry of punches probably set up foreman and his corner that ali would try to win using his speed
6190875 foreman and author norman mailer claimed they saw alis trainers loosen the ropes before the fight
6190876 foreman came out of his corner in the second round expecting a toe to toe battle
6190877 when foreman did throw a punch at his face ali was able to lean back or move his head just enough that the blow missed or had little impact this was a special skill ali had through most of his career he would often hit an opponent while pulling back to avoid a counterpunch
6190878 although he primarily used the rope a dope technique ali occasionally counter attacked with fast crisp blows to foremans face then he would slip back into the defensive mode in this way he was controlling the pace of the fight according to his liking
6190879 by the seventh round foreman had essentially punched himself out

6190936 what is this post really about i dont really feel that its about the gymnastics age limit or even really about whether fraud occurred at this point i believe that any reasonable observer already understands that age records have been forged this story now is really about internet censorship the act of removing evidence while at the same time claiming that the evidence is wrong for the first time i watched search records shift under my feet like sand facts draining down a hole in the internet will this stand

6190996 republican party officials in several states are in a frenzy over how to persuade sen
6190997 i think theres such sufficient understanding at the most senior levels of this campaign of the importance of the pro family constituency that im very comfortable with how the selection process is proceeding one republican strategist close to the campaign said
6190998 such a formulation would be unlikely to satisfy rush limbaugh the conservative radio talk show host and longtime mccain nemesis who on tuesday sounded a siren for his listeners
6190999 republicans said mr romney remained a contender although the two were bitter rivals in the primary campaign and do not have strong chemistry in addition mr romney a mormon could be a difficult sell to christian conservatives a person associated with mr romney said tuesday that he had detected no strong interest from the mccain campaign in recent weeks republicans said mr pawlenty an evangelical christian was also a strong possibility his main drawback is that he has little name recognition outside of minnesota
6191000 the mccain campaign has very adroit of late of inserting itself into the media narrative at times when the assumption that obama was going to own a week
6191001 do whatever you want as long as it doesnt impact me
6191002 except that we dont take money from lobbyists and mccain does
6191003 no political appointees in an obama administration will be permitted to work on regulations or contracts directly and substantially related to their prior employer for two years and no political appointee will be able to lobby the executive branch after leaving government service during the remainder of the administration
6191004 including renewable fuel standards and greenhouse gas emissions gas price gouging and regulation labor and antitrust related to the oil industry defense the stimulus package the farm bill irs code regarding refineries and more
6191005 obama has vowed to not to have federal lobbyists involved with his campaign or allow them in an obama administration
6191006 but most importantly people arent sure whether that essential part of the american dream the idea of we work hard and we sacrifice the next generations going to be a little bit better off than we were people arent sure whether that still holds true
6191007 john mccain has provided honorable service to our country but when it comes to his economic policies he is promising and proposing the same things weve been doing for the last eight years
6191008 weve got to partner with our governors to come up with these plans the way that mark warner did such a wonderful job when he was governor and the way that tim kaine is currently doing such a great job as governor of virginia
6191009 more debt on the backs of your children and grandchildren
6191010 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
6191011 he has made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt seem to understand the consequences of an american defeat in iraq how it would risk a wider war and threaten the security of american families
6191012 i am going to end this war but when i bring our troops home they will come home with honor and victory leaving iraq secured as a democratic ally in the arab heartland
6191013 she remains in critical condition at present in our intensive care unit our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this very difficult time

6191031 aber er geht nicht dran das sieht alles sehr sehr schlimm aus
6191032 diese ungewissheit ob sie unter den verletzten sind vielleicht sogar unter den toten
6191033 in the baidu cache which apparently has not been hit with the scrub brush yet two spreadsheets published by the chinese government on sport gov cn both list he kexins birthday as 01 01 1994 making her 14 years old
6191034 regardless of whether this has any impact on the ioc i think the important lesson here is that citizens dont have to rely on major institutions to get the news
6191035 i dont really feel that its about the gymnastics age limit or even really about whether fraud occurred
6191036 at this point i believe that any reasonable observer already understands that age records have been forged this story now is really about internet censorship the act of removing evidence while at the same time claiming that the evidence is wrong for the first time i watched search records shift under my feet like sand facts draining down a hole in the internet will this stand
6191037 the news of russias potential response to the us poland missile shield is causing crude to recover from earlier losses here
6191038 one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of american military projects involving the one sided development of a global missile shield system
6191039 geopolitical risks ranging from russia to iran continue to remind the market that major supply sources remain in very hot spots of the globe
6191040 well a lot of things kind of came together i had a band called
6191041 i have no fear of entering the world of contemporary music as i dont think it will alienate most of my fans i think that because i know a lot of my fans not only my own personal fans come into my music with an open mind but i know a lot of them openly enjoy more than just the genre of hard rock music so therefore i can go into something a little more contemporary i can go into something ive been dreaming of doing for a long time i just didnt have the tools and the team to do it so to speak but more importantly its the idea of finding a new and different audience who dont know who i am
6191042 this is an album for people who never heard of jeff scott soto and for the most part i think ive said it in a few blogs and interviews before most of my fans will follow me in what i do theyve been pretty open to what ive done from love parade onward but this is a whole other chapter of what im about and instead of taking just one genre of what they know me as and another genre of what they know me as im kinda putting it all into just one big stew and mixing it up this time its hard to really talk about a new album and categorize it or separate it from your entire career but this really does sound and feel like a separation from everything ive already done
6191043 the chinese authorities have informed us that they have refused paul gadd entry into hong kong
6191044 its a matter for the chinese authorities what happens next
6191045 take into consideration all relevant factors and circumstances when processing applications
6191046 the world is dead out there they have their ears closed they dont understand whats going on at this moment its gonna take them 10 15 20 years to wake up and realize what they missed
6191047 our methods have the potential of providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6191048 also the effectiveness of early preventative drug therapies can be better assessed with these methods
6191049 it has all these painful consequences and makes it difficult to move it results in a severe loss of quality of life for those who are affected by it
6191050 given the lack of knowledge about oa i think any method that is noninvasive and relatively easy to apply will be quite valuable not only do you address diagnosis but you address how we can understand oas mechanism
6191051 there are drugs on the market for oa treatment but no one really knows how effective they are after having done the research we got a lot of calls from pharmaceutical companies wanting to show that their drugs work
6191052 i really hope it will develop into the gold standard technique
6191053 im pretty confident in saying that its one of the better methods out there for testing cartilage health
6191054 well it was really good when you were playing for the grizzlies i interviewed you once by your locker
6191055 being able to notice things around me that were not getting done and volunteering to do them not only do you learn from such experiences but one thing often leads to another opportunity it also helps to be in the right place at the right time i was lucky in that regard
6191056 police were tipped off by villagers who came across the farms while pig hunting these people who are farming marijuana are moving to what we call is no mans land no villagers live around here as it is very isolated many of the discoveries have been stumbled upon by accident so the farmers are moving their farms further inside by the time police arrive there is no one there
6191057 it is striking what different patterns in eye blinks emerged for liars and truth tellers
6191058 put your people first stay close to your customer and their changing needs and stay close to your core values and core assets
6191059 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
6191060 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
6191061 today we start a new chapter of paraguayan history whose authorities will be relentless against the thieves in their communities
6191062 all the oil paraguay needs in this century venezuela has and venezuela guarantees to supply paraguay right to the last drop for the development of paraguays people industry and agriculture
6191063 this has been a negotiation between close allies and friends and while there have naturally been ups and downs throughout that entire process ive been gratified that we have both delegations that is to say have approached this in the spirit of trying to do something that was important for both countries securities and as allies and friends
6191064 what happens in the days and months to come will determine the future course of us russian relations but by the same token my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
6191065 i accuse the government of russia of deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing and i can prove it with international organizations already bringing testimony to what im saying and weve received 1 400 reports of brutal attacks slaughters rapes and internment of people in violation of rules of geneva conventions and international humanitarian law
6191066 the israeli report on the killing of fadel has grown fears among palestinian journalists covering the conflict with israel in the gaza between the palestinians and the israelis in the gaza strip about the mission you know the mission to cover and to film and we have been hearing from all other colleagues that they are not certain they are not sure about their lives anymore after such a report which makes clear that the mere raising of a camera in the street in a refugee camp or near the border can put someones life in danger
6191067 in this incident on april 16th six civilians were killed by flechette darts a weapon that is illegal that should not be being used in these conditions in the gaza strip and one of the six was a journalist
6191068 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honor the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak he signed together with the president of georgia and which was brokered by the european union presidency france
6191069 it seems like nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime it is trying to save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
6191070 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone it is nonetheless a system that establishes firmly again and reaffirms the strategic cooperation relationship and friendship between poland and the united states
6191071 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6191072 we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
6191073 recalling how washington saw the post cold war world and america s place in or atop it helps us understand why policymakers failed to anticipate deter or deflect the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001
6191074 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191075 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
6191076 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
6191077 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
6191078 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see you can not not react with compassion and pity for what the individuals of gaza is going through i want to reach there all of us desperately hope that there will be humanitarian aid increase and a port opened for these people to be able to go in and out of this giant open air prison
6191079 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191080 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the twenty first century the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
6191081 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
6191082 i want to have a dialogue with the russians i want them to get out of georgian territory as quickly as possible and i am interested in good relations between the united states and russia but in the twenty first century nations dont invade other nations
6191083 we bid farewell to a star whom we loved to the point of adoration after the 9th of august was a bright day in the palestinian culture and history and humanity when this stubborn knight stepped away from poetry and literature to leave in us a sun that does not set and a river that does not stop flowing with goodness and humanity and hope
6191084 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
6191085 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive
6191086 do no harm and psychologists have to do the same thing we need that as citizens
6191087 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups pakistans government has started the process of choosing a new president bilawal bhutto zardari the son of assassinated former pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto said musharrafs resignation is good for the country bilawal bhutto zardari i see that the biggest hurdle in the way of democracy has been removed and i am sure we can get on with solving all the issues of our country the pakistan peoples party is wants to have an independent judiciary and is firm behind that stance and im sure well move forward with that issue as well
6191088 musharrafs quitting was in the air for a long time he has met the fate of all dictators he ruled pakistan for over eight years and i can say that he has not been particularly friendly towards india during this period many of the problems in our bilateral relationship were entirely because of him so his quitting should generally be regarded a good news for india and south asia
6191089 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response and we have all the resources at our disposal for such a response economic political and military
6191090 tell your mexican friends to get out of shenandoah or you ll be laying next to him
6191091 the indigenous groups have occupied the corral quemado bridge closed the marginal motorway and threatened to shut off the oil and gas pipelines in camisea and the peruvian state cant allow this to happen
6191092 we conserve the environment we are not ignorant we are prepared we know that foreigners want to buy our amazon lands because they know they are the worlds lungs we will not allow this we will die fighting for our rights
6191093 the ioc seems oblivious to the fact that theyre holding the games in a repressive environment
6191094 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin

6191099 although an honest belief need not be reasonable such a belief is easier to establish where there is a reasonable basis for it
6191100 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture
6191101 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the us once prosecuted as war crimes
6191102 no one welcomes war i recognize the enormous difficulties in afghanistan but my country and yours have a stake in seeing that natos first mission beyond europes borders is a success for the people of afghanistan and for our shared security the work must be done america cannot do this alone
6191103 i would rather speak at a rally or a gathering any place outside the united states after i am president of the united states but thats a judgment that senator obama and the american people will make
6191104 i feel like justice has been served and in all truth this war criminal the oppressor known as luciano benjamin menendez is going to rot in jail which is exactly what he deserves
6191105 the bottom line here is that weve shifted money to help the democratically elected government of pakistan to fight a common foe a common enemy that we have we believe that these upgrades that had already been approved will help the pakistanis us it will help the pakistanis help us fight this common foe and that we believe that this is a positive way to help a friend
6191106 we consider this day as a black day in the history of iraqi sport it is a black day as it terminates all the aspirations of the iraqi athletes and their hopes to achieve personal records iraqi records and records for their national unions all these hopes have come to an end this day because of this decision which is done not by iraqi hands but by foreign hands
6191107 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191108 well these elections werent legitimate they werent legal and im not going to leave

6191121 designed for use by the military in the event of a national catastrophe a suspension of the constitution or the imposition of martial law
6191122 you know look weve had a very difficult time uncovering all of whats happened under bush and vice president cheney in terms of you know policies on torture interrogation rendition the whole surveillance program the whole warrentless surveillance program maybe there should be another church committee as was set up during the 1970s to look at intelligence abuse
6191123 i wouldnt even be surprised if that in some polls that you saw a little bit of a dip as a consequence weve been out of the country for a week people are worried about gas prices theyre worried about home foreclosures so the reason that i thought this trip was important was i am convinced that many of the issues that we face at home are not going to be solved as effectively unless we have strong partners abroad
6191124 we strongly condemn this decision by the defense ministry to allow new settlements in the west bank in the jordan valley this is not the interest of the israeli people and the israeli public to have new settlements while we are having negotiations with the palestinians about having the two states
6191125 no no this is important you were using these commentators as your spokespeople
6191126 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191127 well apparently within the framework of well prepared plan several hundred pieces of russian equipment russian airborne troops commanded by head of airborne troops of russia certain with the rank of general landed there and expelled and certainly killed part of the population the whole population from that place is gone this is classical case of ethnic cleansing
6191128 what i least want is for somebody to take advantage of the image of manfred to bring about a confrontation between members of cochabamba residents thats why today i am letting the secretary general of the prefecture to continue this work while i conduct the pertinent legal affairs and while i show that the decree of the electoral court was harmful to justice in bolivia
6191129 told me that he will kill me and chop my body into pieces
6191130 it is a sad day when judges need to remind jailers not to threaten their detainees with death and mutilation

6191132 fantastic misgovernment of the kind we have seen is not an accident nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society this movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction
6191133 the wrecking crew how a gang of right wing con men destroyed washington and made a killing
6191134 hey the dudes in jail you know problems over problem solved
6191135 the group managed to collect tribute from canning and bottling companies two oil companies an electric company because pirgs were then working to set up utility watchdog groups
6191136 oh no no no apartheid you know its on its way out you know its shriveling away
6191137 im sorry youre not going to be able to do any of those things because the deficit is so huge that the only thing youre going to be able to do as president the only economic policy youre going to be allowed to have structurally permitted to have is deficit reduction
6191138 non je nai rien fait pour me mettre dans une telle situation dans ce merdier innomable
6191139 150 what is that thats like 2 days of gas
6191140 well i think they could find a better way to spend it
6191141 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191142 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
6191143 were better at this than you people we have relationships where you often have none lets try to exercise the known and the knowable here so that we can bring at least some clarity to this debate
6191144 we have recently learned about british intelligence finding niger documents on uranium
6191145 we now know that there may be no wmd in iraq
6191146 well only a few people know about this i dont understand how you know clearly you do do you want me to talk about it confirm it
6191147 look 25 percent of us thought it was denial and deception
6191148 well well look for that one and well get back to you
6191149 hey these are the last days of this administration its over forget it whats the use of continuing the investigation
6191150 id bet my career on it everything was coming from those guys at this point go check this go do this some of it fanciful
6191151 well certainly in terms of specifically disinformation a lie they hadnt done the deception
6191152 but do you know specifically it was from the vice president
6191153 no what i know is it was from the white house
6191154 its ridiculous habbush isnt going to want to sign this thing hes too smart for that you know hes the intelligence chief of iraq hes a guy like us
6191155 were probably just going to have to fabricate it ourselves get someone to write it and then just deliver it
6191156 i wish george had more experience in actual operations like some cia directors because he could have told his bosses in the white house this is a bad idea
6191157 well actually you know this is not the kind of thing that we would do on our own
6191158 this is a golden opportunity we have a window right into saddams inner circle through the intelligence chief habbush we can put anything through that window we can put misinformation through that window we can turn saddam in various directions we even can send habbush in with a team to take saddam out
6191159 imagine then we could walk to baghdad instead of fight our way to baghdad something that could save many american lives
6191160 my goodness american lives are at stake here youre cutting off the channel because you dont want to know more and we have to now go forward without the advantages and opportunities that habbush might have provided
6191161 we understand this is classified but we have people here who are charged to look at classified information in a kind of lockbox
6191162 well give it to you when were good and ready
6191163 they dont hold water in courts when there is the issue of wrongdoing
6191164 this is my business youre on a need to know basis ill tell you what i believe youre supposed to know
6191165 that is impossible that you would think that is an issue of national security
6191166 oh what can i do well you know where do i engage you know theyre the pros and im just going about my life
6191167 now wait a second i kind of own this government the way this works is im the sovereign the people theyre servants public servants
6191168 i have seen no coverage of rons allegations in the new york times i think such is important to legitimize the issues he raises has ron been contacted by the times why does he think there has been no coverage
6191169 how can i advance the story how can i find essentially my own fresh added corroboration added evidence essentially to what is clearly laid out in the book
6191170 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191171 im just a tourist im here just to show and to see the games
6191172 im not going to spend 56 to tour something that isnt even real
6191173 this was stupid what these people did playing a practical joke with evidence
6191174 always the butt of practical jokes because he has an inflated view of himself as a super cop
6191175 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191176 i have to hang up right now and dont ever call me again

6191178 the epidemic is far from over let me repeat the epidemic is far from over and we are going to be in this for the long haul first and foremost we must do a much better job of prevention this is the only way to get ahead and ensure an adequate long term response
6191179 homophobia is a societal sickness which impedes development limits expression and human rights such is the hatred for hiv aids that public health policy has been significantly slowed
6191180 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east
6191181 i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
6191182 and some of those tactics very frankly you mention the war in iraq are somewhat like that we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control and you provide them with a stable environment and then they cooperate with law enforcement
6191183 repatriation is pretty much a death sentence in some of these cases ive seen patients bundled onto the plane and out of the country and once that person is out of sight hes out of mind
6191184 what we have today could in no way be described as a democracy today we have an oligarchy power limited to a closed circle
6191185 in the face of the numerous attacks that are made against the african community or the black community by the same us government that you aspire to lead and were talking about attacks like the subprime mortgage that you spoke of that wasnt just a general ambiguous kind of phenomenon but a phenomenon that targeted the african community and latino community attacks like the killing of sean bell by the new york police department and javon dawson right here in st petersburg by the st pete police and the jena six and hurricane katrina and the list goes on in the face of all these attacks that are clearly being made on the african community why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited african community or black community in this country
6191186 ive been talking about predatory lending for the last two years in the united states senate and worked to pass legislation to prevent it when i was in the state legislature and i have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target african american and latino communities ive said that repeatedly number two jena six i was the first candidate to get out there and say this is wrong that theres an injustice thats been done and we need to change it thats number two when sean bell got shot i put out a statement immediately saying this is a problem

6191194 for the last twelve hours inhuman and indiscriminate aerial bombardments of the georgian territory continued the scale of devastating destruction and loss of innocent lives has yet to be assessed russian ground troops armed invasion transformed already in a full scale occupation of parts of georgian territory the process of extermination of georgian population
6191195 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was
6191196 definitely there has to be a very clear timeline timeline ok
6191197 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
6191198 what the bolivian people have expressed today is the consolidation of change were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalization
6191199 yeah i actually i was dragged out by the police so you can see like ive been bleeding from like being dragged on the floor and then this is from the security guards this is from the security guards inside when they had this like cardboard that was like slicing my arm open in the beginning we hoped to actually go in and we hoped to hold up a tibetan flag and also this other banner you know in protest of the communist partys one party rule in china
6191200 we ask the united nations and the international society to push north korea pakistan and israel to denuclearize and hold strict measures against irans suspected nuclear weapons

6191216 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george coming back tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationary and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals saying you may not like this but here is our next mission and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish ultimately people even talked about it after the fact it was a dark day for the cia it was the kind of thing where they said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forward a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
6191217 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector working with state and local governments to achieve a single overarching goal in ten years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
6191218 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is im willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
6191219 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and dont leave until we do republican and democrat joining together and a very vital part of that is nuclear power and another vital part of that is offshore drilling we have to drill here and drill now
6191220 im not satisfied in part because i think they havent been as forthcoming not only with me but with the american people about the status of this investigation i also havent seen the evidence and i think that given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical
6191221 we oppose the visit by bush who sells us beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public
6191222 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
6191223 there was a dozen ideas proffered how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and the next time one of our boats goes through the straits of hormuz start a shoot up might cost some lives and it was rejected because you cant have americans killing americans but thats the kind the level of stuff we are talking about provocation but that was rejected
6191224 we now brought home all five of the combat brigades and the three marine units that were sent to iraq as part of the surge the last of these surge brigades returned home this month and later this year general petraeus will present me his recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
6191225 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
6191226 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
6191227 mr karadzic you are charged with one count of genocide under article 4 of the statute of the international tribunal with one count of complicity in genocide under article 4 of the statute with five counts of crimes against humanity under article 5 of the statute and with four counts of war crimes under articles 2 and 3 of the statute
6191228 i have to say this is a question of life and death if mr holbrooke still wants my death and regrets there is no capital punishment i am wondering if his arm is long enough to reach me even here
6191229 the current food crisis which is true in many many countries and the poorer you are the more affected you are by that is affecting also the fight against aids and we have the paradoxical situation that some people have access to pretty expensive and sophisticated drugs but have no food to eat nothing to eat or dont have the money to take the bus to go to the medical center and have no job
6191230 through this analysis we also hope to be able to answer a question that goes beyond just finding water ice but is this a habitable zone on mars habitable zone meaning that we have periodic liquid water not today but over time and we have the materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms it will be for a future mission to find if anybodys home in this environment

6191248 this should be clear that this report is not just going to lie down put into some store somewhere its a report thats going to be used its a report that is going to help in bringing to justice or in making attempts very serious attempts to bring to justice people that were involved in committing genocide in this country
6191249 this is a story of much greater significance than just my sister or one woman her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
6191250 everything interfaces with security influences it and is influenced by it we must remember that it will all be meaningless if israel should be weak vulnerable and surrounded by enemies
6191251 the report was aiming to assess the conservation status of all primates so 634 species and the findings of the report are very very worrying for the conservation of primates 48 percent were classified as being threatened with extinction and thats an unprecedented rate among species and groups of species that have been assessed in the past

6191254 conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
6191255 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
6191256 look hes an expert on iraq go talk to him
6191257 my goodness thats an awful lot in one letter solving so many of the white houses problems all at once
6191258 the second nugget in the book involves a supposed order from the white house to me at the cia to have my staff fabricate a letter connecting iraq with al qaida and the attacks of 9 11
6191259 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
6191260 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
6191261 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
6191262 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
6191263 yes but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
6191264 but he didnt say that specifically i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
6191265 right im with you im with you but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
6191266 im going to trust truth at to the end of this era
6191267 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
6191268 i have this young son hes a guy hes a smart guy hes a little bit wayward and maybe rob as a bit of an older guy maybe you could spend some time with him
6191269 well maybe well throw someone over the side maybe well open up
6191270 no no tim that was just one source who said that
6191271 i have no knowledge not that i want to have knowledge not that i dug to find knowledge i have no knowledge
6191272 you know maybe its time for us to meet with the americans
6191273 can we help at this point you know we get it alright
6191274 we can help with iraq we can help with afghanistan we know these countries
6191275 you know ron you know ive been talking about these democratic values my whole life but finally just in the last month im really starting to understand their power
6191276 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
6191277 look at my situation im now going to wash away the entire musharraf power structure because the fact is is im rising and hes plummeting thats one opponent also the jihadists are realizing that i might create a counterpoint in this whole region to bin laden so now ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because dick cheney wont make the phone call
6191278 your safety is based on the state of our relationship make no mistake
6191279 if anything happens up here in the next week we know where to find you
6191280 my goodness if we get you its going to be curtains
6191281 usman hold onto your dreams dont let those be troubled or darkened by whats happening now
6191282 im ready to move forward based on what i will say clearly i have learned
6191283 we have no plan we have no plan on this score
6191284 and youre telling me what considering what youve done ultimately youre down in the mud with us now get used to it
6191285 im not going to back off this man is innocent
6191286 you know at days end if were true to our oath we dont really have enemies certainly no enemies that cant be easily defeated if we want to be secure america has to start embracing a kind of authenticity to say were not going to do back door ugly things that end up ruining our status in the world the oaths the values are strong enough if you believe in them the world will bend toward you even on the most specific issue of information that will help us be secure
6191287 well you know i let them think theyre saving me but of course im saving them
6191288 but oddly thats where the problem starts because then i say i saved you and now heres what i want and make it transactional see thats a lie

6191296 this is a guarantee to keep any more worker safety regulation from ever coming out this is being done in secrecy to be sprung before president bush leaves office to cripple the next administration
6191297 what i think can change is the ability of the united states government and a united states president to be actively engaged with the peace process and to be concerned and recognize the legitimate difficulties that the palestinian people are experiencing right now and recognize that it is not only in the interest of the palestinian people that their situation improves i believe its also in the interest of the israeli people because it is going to be very difficult for israel ever to feel secure if you dont have some sense of opportunity and prosperity and stability with its its neighbors
6191298 its the credibility of the us the interest of the us has been adversely all affected by the last three years of american policy that has wreaked havoc in the region we need re engagement but we need positive re engagement in ways that would curb israeli violations and would help produce a just and genuine peace
6191299 why have we come to rely on private contractors to provide combat or combat related security training for our forces
6191300 mr hamdan or any accused at guantanamo but for right now mr hamdan if he is convicted he will stay at guantanamo bay if he is acquitted completely hell stay at guantanamo bay and if hes convicted and he gets lets say time served hes going to stay at guantanamo bay because the government has stated through their prosecutor mr murphy that regardless of what outcome in this case theyre allowed to detain mr hamdan for the duration of the global war on terrorism
6191301 were in danger of losing our country to a war based on lies to destruction of our civil liberties but its your commitment and your willingness to stand up and speak out that has enabled me to take a stand and to say not only are we going to save whats right and save whats dear to us but were going to hold this administration accountable so that it never happens again
6191302 theres no question about it wall street got one of the reasons i asked you to turn off the tv cameras it got drunk and now its got a hangover the question is how long will it sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments and then we got a housing issue not in houston and evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house i like crawford but unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice im now no longer the decision maker

6191308 if you havent found any weapons it doesnt mean there are no weapons
6191309 these may look like common objects to you but to us they could be weapons or they could be used to make weapons or to ship weapons or to store weapons because only an expert can see they might be weapons and only an expert can deal with weapons cause only an expert can deal with the problem and only an expert can deal with the problem that only an expert can deal with the problem

6191328 look it you know was painful you know id love to go over to visit my friends in china and its a great position to head the summer program you get paid very well its a terrific position
6191329 you know i have to admit if i hadnt been barred from entering the country i might find myself hedging my own opinions about china just so as not to anger the chinese government
6191330 oh and by the way its irrelevant that i work for stonebridge people ought to know that
6191331 well its because you know were brookings and we want more credit for brookings
6191332 im for engagement when people like henry kissinger talk about engagement they mean black tie affairs with top government and business leaders but those leaders are not the same as the chinese people

6191337 no peace process will be achieved either in this year or the expected years israel backed by america is not intended to give the palestinian people their basic demand by establishment of an independent state and for this reason we resorted to the military activities in order to push the occupation and to make an end by our alternative method
6191338 please do not respond to questions or make any statements
6191339 it appears that what brought him to this horrible event was his lack of being able to obtain a job his frustration over that and his stated hatred for the liberal movement we have recovered a four page letter in which he describes his feelings and the reason that he claims that he committed these offenses

6191343 the new president who will replace president bush is not going to change his policy in iraq his policy will remain the same regarding the occupation and iraq will see no change i do not think that he is going to change anything because the us policy is clear to everyone
6191344 if the iraqi government were to say if you were president we want a timetable for troops being removed would you agree to that
6191345 ive been there too many times ive met too many times with him and i know what they want they want it based on conditions and of course theyd like to have us out thats what happens when you win wars
6191346 mukasey is asking congress to expand and extend the war on terror forever anyone that this president or the next one declares to be a terrorist could then be held indefinitely without a trial
6191347 he is charged with genocide complicity to commit genocide murder extermination cruel treatment torture etc its a huge array of crimes committed in bosnia and herzegovina solely between march and december 1992 when bosnians serb republic was declared and radovan karadzic was its president but also for the crimes that were committed in the country from 92 until november 1995 including the genocide in srebrenica
6191348 if he is guilty he has to be arrested but he is less guilty than others but they are not arrested only serbs are being arrested

6191353 this policy should be condemned internationally through human rights organizations and they should be punished via an international court and not an israeli court at the end of the day they will be released the officer after a month or two or a short period he is in prison in front of the media but not in reality

6191358 im here on this trip to reaffirm the special relationship between israel and the united states my abiding commitment to israels security and my hope that i can serve as an effective partner whether as a united states senator or as a president in bringing about a more lasting peace in the region
6191359 these positions mean that there is no minimal hope to any change in the us foreign policy towards the arab israeli conflict and this means that we are in front of one american policy and the palestinian people should depend on their own and on the arab and muslim world in facing this opposing american policy which both the democratic and republican parties are adopting
6191360 unless chevron is out of there the united states doesnt have the moral authority to tell other countries to get out
6191361 regarding the conspiracy issue president morales addressed over the course of twenty minutes and with the aid of documents the political operation carried out and being carried out by the us embassy in bolivia the bolivian government president morales himself has requested the united states halt with its political conspiring in bolivia and instead has posed working together to conspire against poverty
6191362 the question is do you want to play russian roulette with your brain i dont know that cell phones are dangerous but i dont know that they are safe
6191363 this should outrage every american that fox uses hateful language to talk about the person who may be the first black president but the obamas are not the only targets foxs pattern is race baiting and fear mongering regularly focuses on black leaders black institutions and ordinary black people like when they used the solemn occasion of coretta scott kings funeral to call black leaders racist thats not acceptable its offensive to black americans its offensive to all americans thats why i wrote on my new album a song called sly fox watch what you watchin fox keeps feeding us toxin stop sleepin start thinkin

6191370 the coalition believes leadership believes that it has become imperative to move for impeachment under the article 47 against general musharraf
6191371 all i can tell you is that an administrative action was taken against sergeant kelt and that administration that administrative action was a negative action however the finding was that he had an otherwise stellar career as a soldier and as a recruiter and he was given additional responsibilities as a recruiting station commander which he continues to do so today just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty
6191372 well theres a difference between the death penalty and a promotion he was actually promoted after this and came to be the commander of another recruiting station
6191373 im not allowed to tell you im sorry thats covered under army regulations and department of defense regulations so i cannot discuss administrative actions taken against a recruiter
6191374 the fact that an act is undertaken to prevent a threatened terrorist attack rather than for the purpose of humiliation or abuse would be relevant to a reasonable observer in measuring the outrageousness of the act

6191378 the real travesty of all of this is is that the offenses for which mr hamdan was found not guilty today were the only offenses that he was charged with initially back in 2004 he was acquitted of all those the only specifications he was convicted of are offenses that were added after the fact by the military commissions act in 2006 long after he was confined here at guantanamo bay
6191379 painstaking investigation led us to the conclusion that dr bruce e ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and that it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
6191380 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press and freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

6191535 we have gotten a great deal of attention for the actions were taking at our newspapers to address the issues we and our peers face declining ad revenue secular difficulties facing our major advertising groups and the expansion of media choices available to consumers clearly as you recognize we are not alone i would point out however that at the end of the day we have the largest newsgathering staffs in our markets and the 2nd and 3rd largest in the country in chicago and los angeles that is true even after implementing the staff reductions to which you refer

6191537 it is frustrating to find the department in denial with regional director des gorman claiming a large number of applicants for two advertised positions in the region

6191539 these improvements offer new dimensions to the staffing process enabling greater flexibility in filling vacancies
6191540 we are confident that the new staffing procedures will strengthen our ability to attract the best qualified teachers to meet local needs teachers in rural and remote areas continue to have priority for transfer after a period of service
6191541 many of these teachers come from outside the area and it is in our interests to provide an accurate picture of the welcoming lifestyle benefits of our communities as well as the professional and career assets that come with teaching in the north west

6191694 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defense site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea

6191697 if human life begins at the moment of conception it means that abortion must be outlawed in all instances with no possible exception for pregnancies that result from rape or incest by mccains definition those embryos are human beings that must be protected without regard to how they might have been created it also means that iuds are not a form of birth control but murder weapons because they operate by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus thus starving it to death some prolife physicians even believe that the birth control pill is an abortion device because in some cases the pill can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg

6191699 you are seeing this tug of war between commodity fundamentals and also what are the u s economic fundamentals
6191700 that is what is causing oil to go up and down
6191701 you are just picking up some extra cargos that are just getting counted
6191702 we generally do work off inventories at this time of year a draw is not unusual
6191703 we went from being well above average to now just below the 5 year average
6191704 in the grand scheme of things on an absolute level it is not that bad
6191705 what we are seeing is a global slowdown in the economy and that is contributing to the weaker demand numbers that we have seen
6191706 that concept is starting to change these high prices are having an effect on global growth and it will slow down demand going forward
6191707 now people are looking at the market with more reality

6191712 we have increased the horizontal section as compared to jas 1 and the reservoir in this direction seems to live up to high expectations we are now eagerly awaiting the flow test
6191713 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6191714 of course a draw with one of the worlds best football teams is a positive result but theres no reason for euphoria its only a draw we still need to work hard to achieve something serious
6191715 the australian government is firm in our commitment to honour our war dead and is already undertaking historical research to establish any identification links

6191718 language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature
6191719 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6191720 that is unacceptable and i hope this decision and the fine imposed demonstrates that fact
6191721 it is anticipated the icc task team hook up will take place on friday 22 august and the icc board hook up will be held on sunday 24 august
6191722 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
6191723 our safety concerns are very much based on the report that was supplied by the icc and the report of the fica world players body commission which the pakistan board has and the report that reg dickason completed for cricket australia
6191724 sri lanka has its own set of problems we havent been through the process of analysing them yet
6191725 we advise you to reconsider your need to travel to sri lanka at this time because of the very high risk of politically motivated violence
6191726 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6191727 of course a draw with one of the worlds best football teams is a positive result but theres no reason for euphoria its only a draw we still need to work hard to achieve something serious
6191728 there has been a very serious difference of opinion between brian barwick the fa chief executive and lord triesman the new fa chairman
6191729 they disagreed over the role of the chief executive restructuring of the football association
6191730 the end result is that barwick is leaving his post he will leave on december 31st
6191731 we have not been able to confirm the number of dead but it is very high
6191732 how stupid does australia look when we are flying people in from overseas to do these jobs
6191733 theres not enough encouragement in the system to get people off the dole and into these jobs
6191734 if youre not prepared to put your hand up for a job no matter where it is we shouldnt have to continue paying the dole
6191735 the impact on the energy market has been significant as demonstrated by the momentous jump in gas and electricity prices the amount of gas available to export from norway to countries including the uk will be cut significantly and without adequate storage the uk will be left to negotiate with russia and the far east for supplies or risk running low on energy

6191739 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6191740 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6191741 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words
6191742 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6191743 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6191744 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee taekwondo team in iran
6191745 it is wonderful that an afghan athlete can win a medal in the world olympics
6191746 young people should draw hope and inspiration from this olympic win
6191747 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan
6191748 in a country like afghanistan the only thing we hear about all the time is violence and fighting this is finally good news for afghanistan
6191749 even though i didnt buy my glasses there and in fact had never been a customer
6191750 sorry the vintage raybans broke but weve sent them out for repair

6191754 voc obrigado a atualizar para uma vers o mais moderna
6191755 if you look at what the springboks did in the last game they took on new zealand whove been the most successful scrum in the world in the last three years and they had them under severe pressure from the very first scrum of the game and they delivered 100 per cent scrum ball themselves
6191756 thats something that they havent done in other tests this year so we believe on the back of last weeks performance this is the best scrum in the world and matfield in the lineout speaks for himself
6191757 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6191758 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6191759 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6191760 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6191761 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6191762 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6191763 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6191764 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6191765 such actions create mistrust and spur an arms race on the continent and beyond its borders
6191766 its clear to us and the american leadership doesnt deny it that the so called missile shield in europe will be widened and modernised in that case russia will be compelled to react and not only by diplomatic protests
6191767 ever clearer attempts to change the strategic balance of forces in its favour and hinder stability and predictability in world affairs
6191768 such a battery can have nothing to do with parrying imaginary iranian threats
6191769 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6191770 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting
6191771 people just cant believe what hes been doing there is a superhuman aspect to it from that standpoint hes hard to top
6191772 right now the guys got the world on a string
6191773 hes in that upper realm not in terms of income but in terms of profile with
6191774 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6191775 of course a draw with one of the worlds best football teams is a positive result but theres no reason for euphoria its only a draw we still need to work hard to achieve something serious
6191776 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6191777 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your heads to be professional
6191778 why are we here it is because here we play a part in the freedom of the world here we are fighting against terrorism
6191779 the rise in violence is attributed directly to our lack of attention the allies and all of us to the sanctuaries to the training grounds to the financial resources of terrorists and the taliban
6191780 and unless we do that we will continue to suffer
6191781 we have no reports of any casualties caused by close air support
6191782 tier 1 blockade the xcel center establish 15 20 blockades utilizing a diversity of tactics creating inner and outer rings around st pauls xcel center
6191783 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6191784 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this

6191801 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6191802 obama has deep faith in lord hanuman and that is why we are presenting an idol of hanuman to him
6191803 we will perform the prayers for 11 days and then hand the idol to carolyn who will send it to obama
6191804 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want

6191809 one hopes that fiji sees the sense in sticking to the commitment it gave to leaders and i would think the message coming out of the forum should be that is what it should be doing

6191816 some university presidents shirk responsibility to protect students from dangers of underage drinking
6191817 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
6191818 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
6191819 i wanted to find out more about the offensive side
6191820 i had a chance to sit down and talk about his philosophy it was good i knew at that time they had quarterback problems
6191821 i feel like we have what we need to win on that side of the ball
6191822 i think mike martz feels that way too because if you look at the other quarterbacks who were out there byron leftwich or daunte culpepper he had the opportunity to grab those guys but im pretty sure he was comfortable with what he had here with osullivan and the other two quarterbacks if he believes in them there aint no question im sold
6191823 its what i thought when i did my homework and due diligence before i decided to come here
6191824 i knew we had a lot of good young talent on this team and a lot of people were hungry since ive been here i can see that up close
6191825 there a lot of room for improvement and every day im feeling better step one is the hardest part just getting in line alignment is key because thatll put you a lot closer to the ball than you might think once you get that down everything else falls into place
6191826 ive been very impressed with him the more of those kinds of guys you can get on your roster the better hes not done at all physically hes still good in that respect hes just getting comfortable with when he hears the call
6191827 language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature
6191828 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case

6191840 if you look at what the springboks did in the last game they took on new zealand whove been the most successful scrum in the world in the last three years and they had them under severe pressure from the very first scrum of the game and they delivered 100 per cent scrum ball themselves
6191841 thats something that they havent done in other tests this year so we believe on the back of last weeks performance this is the best scrum in the world and matfield in the lineout speaks for himself
6191842 the challenge is a big one but the way that the guys have approached the training weve been probably fairly annoyed with how we fronted up in that auckland test and thats been motivation enough
6191843 to be one of the first participants in intels program is testimony to our commitment to the intel platform and the sme market
6191844 intel is simplifying the software decision making and buying process for smes which is in line with our goals our team has worked hard to deliver a product to achieve this certification

6191848 their families are just as bereaved as the families of citizens their spouses and children still have to eat have a heart would you
6191849 do you know how much 875 000 and or 4 1 million dollars could benefit our schools our police force our frigging border patrol
6191850 a millionaire is not going to be a burden on our social programs this is obviously the right thing to do
6191851 are you implying that illegal alien status negates any tragedy suffered as a result of 9 11
6191852 i dont understand either you are legally here or illegally here if you are illegally here whether you freaking die on 9 11 does not mean you get a green card
6191853 for gay and lesbian residents who are doing nothing more remarkable than say walking over to cliffs hardware store the idea that as many as six tour buses could turn up at once seems bizarre

6191859 if the baseballs have psa or jsa certs ebay is ok any other certs and i would be very cautious said brian marren vice president of acquisitions for www mastroauctions com auctions in chicago
6191860 if an inexperienced collector turns to ebay to start his collection he should stick with pieces that originated with reputable firms said mike breeden an autograph expert and editor of tuff stuffs autograph guide
6191861 id buy only pieces that carried a hologram from one of the companies you mention psa jsa and perhaps a few others the coa itself in this day and age isnt enough it should have a hologram from the manufacturer or a reputable third party the third party holograms arent infallible but sticking with psa and jsa will certainly dramatically lessen the chances of buying a forgery
6191862 assuming the richter signed stick is real it is worth around 1 500 said mike heffner president of www
6191863 as the virtualization market continues to grow it is critical that our partners can explain the business rationale behind their technology decisions avnets services help partners do just that by mapping virtualization solutions to company objectives and creating a formal business case around the investment
6191864 for some of our firms the third quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reported losses clearly an unprecedented streak
6191865 you know youve hit a bottom when stocks go up on bad news
6191866 there is real belief that the u s economy is working its way through its problems
6191867 financials were oversold so they were due to pick up a bounce
6191868 theres still more volatility to come but they cant get much much worse than they already are
6191869 theres an ongoing fear factor about the credit crunch that continues to drag down some financials
6191870 forestry tasmania has responsible officers managing the eagles within their five districts
6191871 from the information i have received i believe what people are quoting is some changes that have happened within the threatened species section not within forestry tasmania
6191872 you have to learn to use the systems own self organizing tendencies to your advantage
6191873 ok but how is this going to go with the rest of the meal

6191878 save the males why men matter why women should care
6191879 a culture that is hostile toward males contemptuous of masculinity and cynical about the delightful differences that make men irresistible
6191880 in film and music men are variously portrayed as dolts bullies brutes deadbeats rapists sexual predators and wife beaters
6191881 are invariably cast at best as bumbling dim witted fools
6191882 by elevating single motherhood from an unfortunate consequence of poor planning to a sophisticated act of self fulfillment we have helped to fashion a world in which fathers are not just scarce but in which men are superfluous
6191883 its absolutely necessary that i find out who he is to have a normal existence in any way it would be nice if he wanted to meet me but that would be something i want rather than something needed
6191884 by indulging every appetite instead of recognizing the importance of self control and commitment young men encounter little resistance against continuing to celebrate juvenile pursuits losing themselves in video games and mindless guy oriented tv fare and casual sex
6191885 as long as men feel marginalized by the women whose favors and approval they seek as long as they are alienated from their children and treated as criminals by family courts as long as they are disrespected by a culture that no longer values masculinity tied to honor and as long as boys are bereft of strong fathers and our young men and women wage sexual war then we risk cultural suicide
6191886 whether women are better than men i cannot say but i can say they are certainly no worse
6191887 do not let anyone look down on you because you are young instead set an example in life love faith and purity

6191901 people have the freedom to experience humanity without anxiety you get this aesthetic arrest if you think of the idea of james joyce you get this sense that people are actually experiencing this sense of being totally overwhelmed by the beauty of the human in front of them people have this profound deep connection with people through youtube that maybe they couldnt experience in everyday life because theyre not allowed to stare and to experience them as a human being
6191902 some people have said that the videos were creating on youtube should be made with the hopes to change the world ive made mine to help me live in it whether i make a hundred or a thousand more i will know forever that this website this community helped bring me life again and theres something really special in that

6191908 a story of the end of wwii a book about a familys flight through the horror that was the collapse of the thousand year reich i bet thatll be uplifting
6191909 why did jane send me this because im never gonna read it
6191910 can such a belligerent state be trusted as the guarantor of europes energy supply
6191911 its kind of a pathetic way of doing things but i did make the talk
6191912 and when youre in a tight race you want to present your candidate as a well packaged well controlled image that has been constructed based on careful poll taking and focus groups now thats just the way it is if you dont play that game maybe you dont win
6191913 at the very least there could be a debate about something
6191914 they didnt call me moonbeam for nothing i worked hard to get that
6191915 taking money from the very forces that will make it impossible to carry through programs
6191916 hes like the dinner guest you wished you never invited
6191917 i want everyone to know this campaign is about real change were not here to get along and go along
6191918 an obscure governor with a lot of insider contacts who has been propelled by money
6191919 so this reform which started out as oh these bad party bosses now actually goes to the financial leadership
6191920 those with money and the organizations that can spend money they dominate so its becoming dysfunctional based on the reform going to excess
6191921 union busting wage depressing scab inviting environmental disaster of a governor
6191922 the way these conventions and primary nomination processes work very early on the leading candidate wants to put it to bed over and everything else becomes scripted
6191923 and i felt that i had a message a message of reform and i wanted to speak at the convention but before doing that you had to pledge your fealty your loyalty to the winner i didnt feel like doing that
6191924 the irritated clinton camp is barely able to find mr brown much less negotiate the terms of his surrender
6191925 on saturday night mr brown phoned mr clinton but immediately put him on hold while answering another call after five minutes on hold even the eager to please mr clinton hung up only to discover that neither his staff nor the party chief ron brown knew how to reach the elusive mr jerry brown
6191926 i was told that casey was not to be on the platform was not to give a speech and that was the end of it
6191927 everything is reviewed by a team of people who are sitting in the bowels of the convention center speechwriters
6191928 and they review every speech before it goes up on the tele prompter they also write some speeches for people
6191929 oh the democrats or republicans dont know what theyre doing theyve got this fight going on
6191930 and its a show that you dont want too much disruption because that looks a little unruly and we want our candidates controlled and if theres any unruliness its supposed to be packaged not spontaneous or unpredicted or unscripted so there we are its a great american tradition but it sure isnt what it was a few years ago
6191931 hmm offer an exclusive window to amazon for our new book on barack obama or choose broad distribution we choose amazon and amazon alone
6191932 give to us now how we want it when we want it where we want it

6191939 the players are giving me everything theyve got they really are
6191940 and theyre a little tired theyre a little leg weary right now
6191941 and when you get a little leg weary all of a sudden your brain shuts down just a little bit youre thinking more about your legs than doing the right thing
6191942 im kind of whipping them just to kind of get through this
6191943 its important absolutely your starting quarterback has to be ready for the first regular season game
6191944 when the guys have played as long as he has played or some other quarterbacks around the league have played youre not quite as concerned about their minutes in the preseason
6191945 hes a young man we drafted who were counting on to be a factor inside big strong guy and its good to see him back on the field now hes got some ground to make up
6191946 we are waiting for word from the australian embassy in madrid and spanish authorities
6191947 at our peak we operated five flights per day to atlanta but now were down to just two
6191948 the federation council is ready to recognise the independent status of south ossetia and abkhazia if that is what the people of these republics want
6191949 ill tell you what since we only have the tiny bottles ill give you two for the price of one if you give me exact change
6191950 yeah those things tend to breed if you leave them alone long enough
6191951 we already have more than half of doctors not taking medi cal patients because of low reimbursement rates so the additional rate cut was going to further reduce access to care for millions of children parents seniors and people with disabilities
6191952 weve always said these are difficult but necessary cuts in order for the state to close its 15 billion budget deficit
6191953 i think all the way along many of us have thought this was not a good idea because reimbursement rates already are very low and a cut could be the straw that breaks the camels back in physicians and nursing homes deciding not to cover medi cal patients
6191954 right now we have such a big budget hole that we are at loggerheads in resolving that its always difficult when somebody makes the hole bigger
6191955 it looks like the judge recognized that these people have no access and certainly not equal access to services at least not the way the federal program was envisioned
6191956 avineons innovation dedication and flexibility supporting the amps migration have made them a valuable partner as the navy modernizes its infrastructure with their contributions amps will be positioned to better meet the information transfer needs within the highly dynamic navy environment

6191960 were looking forward to working with intel as we continue to bring our customers new features and services that further enhance their viewing experiences
6191961 the success of the widget channel framework relies heavily on the support of industry leaders like comcast
6191962 we feel this support will foster innovation and help bring new and exciting internet widgets to millions of television sets across the country
6191963 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning

6191971 the bottom line is we have a secure budget despite the state budge
6191972 so we think were in a good position to go into this year as well as next year we just need to be prudent with what expenditures we make
6191973 we want more than what the state can provide us in these areas
6191974 its a lot more organized than many home school programs
6191975 were hoping our parents and young people understand there is a time and place for cell phone use and its not in school

6191981 this is something that weve needed for a long time
6191982 it will make us be more clear in the very beginning which is something that maybe we havent been as much as we should be
6191983 what was needed back then as now was clarification as to the powers of the abr and hlc
6191984 there was really this sense that people were cautious about saying no
6191985 what this ordinance does is to say to the design review boards we want you to talk about certain things
6191986 its hard when the climate changes at hlc to go back and then we have to start all over again
6191987 then were subjected to another round of redesign that wasnt anticipated
6191988 once that overall direction is provided that will really provide a better path towards how to consider this
6191989 staff should not delay discussion of the interim ordinance any longer than is absolutely necessary
6191990 we have formed a very strong working group that has done a great deal of positive work on structuring an organization that will have a chance at institutionalizing a long term effort
6191991 in many cases we need to find jobs for a lot of these kids
6191992 i have to tell you there is going to be a price tag on this
6191993 the amount of political will and ongoing commitment youve had in terms of trying to wrap around such a complex issue as this is incredible
6191994 i do not believe that we have yet figured out how to sustain funding at an adequate level to truly reduce gang violence
6191995 it is truly a blow by blow incredibly accurate summation of what happened
6191996 we definitely have to do something to solve this problem its not getting better its getting worse
6191997 its a disservice to this community it degrades the criminal justice system it ultimately makes this county a less safe place to live
6191998 our position and intent to operate the reentry facility until recently was not considered problematic to cdcr
6191999 now were trying to work with these counties to ensure this facility is able to be used by as many inmates as possible and this is a solution that would be beneficial to all parties
6192000 we felt that by us being in control of the facility there would be a better chance of that happening
6192001 in subsequent e mails and phone conversations with the undercover agent mahoney expressed interest in engaging in sexual activities with 12 and 13 year old thai boys and girls
6192002 this case is yet another disturbing reminder that those who have a sexual interest in children believe they can evade detection and prosecution by committing sex crimes overseas
6192003 fortunately for the worlds young people foreign authorities and u s law enforcement are allied in their resolve to combat this problem and bring perpetrators to justice
6192004 the dvd is starting to come together and will consist of two separate discs one will be the live show from our last tour and the other one will be a documentary following the band on the 2005 tour which marked the end of that line up the fact that the band has seen such major changes the last two years made it very difficult emotionally to invest time and energy in this product and it wasnt until the documentary draft was proposed by per hillblom that i started to see what this dvd was trying to communicate we still have a few commentary tracks to record but we are starting to see the end of it

6192009 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable
6192010 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded

6192034 oriented exclusively to delegitimize the judicial public servants investigations or to undermine their credibility
6192035 this proposal serves no real purpose other than to help members of uribes coalition get off the hook
6192036 a senator has told me that she has felt that sectors of justice have wanted to ask her for money
6192037 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
6192038 our first game plan is to get usa 3000 back
6192039 if the county had of listened to us citizens they wouldnt have wasted all this money on a 10 000 foot runway thats not being used
6192040 some of those plans that we thought would have reached fruition by now have been put on the back burner
6192041 if you dont build it theyre not going to come
6192042 they can dress up a pig all the time put panties on it put lipstick on it and its still a pig
6192043 i am really happy to win a medal for india all credit goes to my coaches and my parents especially my father who went to a far away temple to pray for my success since my teammates akhil kumar and jitender kumar had lost i was keen to win a medal
6192044 i had studied him well by watching his videos my strategy was to watch attack and defend
6192045 vijender fought very well he was brilliant his opponent was a good boxer and he has done well to win a medal he fought with skill used his mind and body as well it was really fantastic to watch him in action in such an important bout our strategy was to counter attack and to keep him fresh
6192046 the problem was that he took the lead first and it became difficult for me to overcome him in the later stages of the bout things would have been different had i taken the lead
6192047 i was asked to go all out by the coaches in the third round but i was worried about the stitches below my chin if i had got hit and started oozing blood from the chin the referee would have stopped the fight i had to be careful and the psychological barrier was more difficult to overcome than facing the opponent
6192048 while it would be good to do this in one sitting in all likelihood there will probably have to be a second round of discussions
6192049 in effect we only have a day and half now and that may not be enough time
6192050 it is easier to work the political side of this deal than dealing with technical level players whose attitudes tend to be more rigid
6192051 and at the end of the day that is not going to be acceptable to us
6192052 we know the u s has been extensively consulting with a number of nsg members and probably has a sheet of paper with a bunch of conditions that it will say the others want
6192053 the u s likes to have its own rules and grant waiver authority to the president so it will not want the nsg to adopt something which will make it mandatory for the u s to act in a particular way if something happens between india and another supplier
6192054 i think for them the big fear is enrichment and reprocessing equipment
6192055 they have decided they will never give it to india but if tomorrow the russians or french throw in some enr equipment as a sweetener for a reactor contract which u s suppliers wont be able to do they fear others will have a commercial advantage
6192056 how many are worse off than you were since george bush took office that describes the reality of our politics over the last eight years
6192057 and that is the reason i am running for president of the united states of america because i want to make sure that the next generation here in martinsville here in henry county here in virginia here in the united states of america has the jobs and the opportunity of the future
6192058 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he is opposed to new drilling at home and he is opposed to nuclear power
6192059 my friends we have to have nuclear power nuclear power has got to be part of any way of us being energy independent
6192060 the bottom line i think at this stage is too close to call
6192061 we do not know who is going to win but i think we certainly know the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case
6192062 it is great i have a great feeling it is a dream come true
6192063 no i was worried after the semis but i just told myself to leave everything on the track i had come here to do it and i am so happy with myself
6192064 i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible i am shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring for the world record for so long
6192065 i worked so hard to become the champion i will work harder to stay at the top
6192066 i got out good i ran the corner as hard as possible and once i entered the straight i told myself to keep it up dont die on me now
6192067 this is my first gold medal i felt so successful tonight every time i tried to throw my best
6192068 the strike was spontaneous with eight crore people participating in it it is an expression of deep indignation of the masses against the pernicious economic and labour policies of the united progressive alliance government
6192069 this should be a warning bell for the government because if it does not respond we will prolong this agitation the sponsoring committee of trade unions will meet again in september first week to chalk out further course of action
6192070 the government should realise that all the friends of american president george bush are gone and it should be ready to face the same fate if it tries to suppress the masses
6192071 the only time the offense has success is if we mess up
6192072 i dont think anybody really impresses me on our offense but the offense is going to be alright
6192073 quiero dejar claro que no fui yo ni una persona espec fica la que tom la decisi n fue un acuerdo grupal donde todos y cada uno de los que formamos parte coincidimos

6192082 honestly we totally did but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
6192083 i remember kiely and i would talk and at the end of the first movie we were just crying
6192084 you make a movie with some people you become friends over the process of making this movie and then you go your own way

6192107 thousands of cases of west nile virus have been reported worldwide but 80 of infected people dont show any symptoms
6192108 it is important to have highly sensitive and specific tests to diagnose infections and also to help track the ecology and epidemiology of west nile encephalitis
6192109 although the methods developed are for diagnosing west nile virus in horses the procedures can be easily modified to develop new antibody tests for humans and wildlife
6192110 it is essential to test wildlife for infection to determine the ecological and epidemiological aspects of west nile virus infections in nature so that we can try to control the disease by managing mosquito populations
6192111 we tested 43 privately owned horses for the infection the results showed that none of the horses with undiagnosed illnesses had been infected prior to the 1999 outbreak of west nile virus in connecticut usa
6192112 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6192113 people have been calling me the seniormost actor in the film i almost feel like amitabh bachchan now the others in the film are extremely good actors and not at all inexperienced
6192114 they have a lot of experience and have absolute clarity in their mind on what they want to do they are very spontaneous and we even get together very well in that way
6192115 the character in the film is just like me radhika works and keeps her relationship going simultaneously the role is very contemporary she is an effortless dresser she wears shorts and vests and uses all kinds of funky bags and accessories
6192116 i was completely pampered on the sets and have finally made two great friends in ranbir and siddharth i have not spent enough time with the girls though

6192122 obviously it is frustrating when guns injure or kill people but when a young person is hurt it is a deeper blow
6192123 we are making strides but at times your success is punctuated by incidents like this that show how much more work there is to be done
6192124 its obviously senseless but the fact of the matter is that virtually all these cases are senseless
6192125 it used to be youd arrive at a crime scene and youd find five or six shell casings
6192126 i love you as much as a father can love a child and i love your mother just as much as i love you i show it in different ways because you are different people
6192127 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
6192128 i can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing i think its much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong i have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things but im not absolutely sure of anything and in many things i dont know anything about such as whether it means anything to ask why were here and what the question might mean i might think about a little but if i cant figure it out then i go to something else but i dont have to know an answer i dont feel frightened by not knowing things by being lost in a mysterious universe without having any purpose which is the way it really is as far as i can tell possibly it doesnt frighten me

6192136 the implications are a falling stock price thats what they are afraid of
6192137 lets say apple sold 2 5 million iphone 3gs theyd better make 2 5 million iphones with a fix in it before they announce the recall because you are going to have 2 5 million people wanting another iphone theyd better have them in stock
6192138 too often in the past our states failure to respond quickly to fiscal crises has only made our budget problems worse and the solutions weve had to implement more painful
6192139 today we are taking a different approach rather than simply hoping that our struggling economy improves all sides worked together in the spirit of cooperation and took action to reduce spending i want to thank my partners in the legislature for working productively with me during this special session
6192140 while todays agreement represents a positive step forward for fiscal responsibility in state government the looming deficit we face next year will demand even more difficult choices
6192141 and given the significant continued uncertainty within the economy there are no guarantees that we can avoid additional current year spending reductions if revenues plummet even further i will continue to monitor our states finances carefully and will seek additional action if necessary

6192176 were much better off given the margin putting our money into educating maine voters about what this proposed law really did why its important to keep it and to begin the fall campaign
6192177 this clearly reflects how people feel right now and were moving full speed ahead to begin our campaign to urge all maine people who are fed up with high taxes to vote yes on question 1
6192178 these taxes were passed without a public hearing in the dead of night

6192186 romania have only conceded one goal in the competition and are a difficult team to play against and they showed us that respect and you have to take your chances at this level
6192187 the positive thing to take from the game is that we have shown romania that we are capable of beating them

6192210 if anything i think while it did immense damage to the reputation of british airways and baa it also did highlight how dire the need for expansion really is
6192211 we risk losing out to frankfurt or others we do not have an international hub its that simple
6192212 this may sound trite but we have basically embraced the notion of selling the customer s what they want
6192213 for their own business reasons they are delivering passengers from point to point that is what the traveling public actually wants when they fly whether it be for business or leisure
6192214 the government has a very ambitious aviation expansion policy and an ambitious energy policy of 60 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions
6192215 those people with very strong environmental habits at home did recognize the contradiction but still persist in traveling
6192216 holidays are supposed to be separate from everyday life and we found that people see going on holiday as a chance to really treat themselves
6192217 as the environmental tide starts to become much more ingrained it will be easier to have those conversations with clients about not coming to see them
6192218 it might be the business mentality of the americans that makes the biggest difference
6192219 to get people to pay attention you have to ask does it save money or make money we just might be able to finally make the economic case for going green
6192220 what they dont want is to cut public safety budgets and they dont like loading up a streets plan with projects thrown in by the council that have nothing to do with fixing the streets
6192221 councilors should heed the citys police and fire chiefs who have warned of the dangers to public safety if the larger proposal is approved

6192228 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
6192229 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides

6192238 in shroom a cultural history of the magic mushroom andy letcher has given us a thorough and rigorous study of mushroom culture among books on psychoactive mushrooms shroom is unprecedented in the degree to which the author demands that arguments be supported by evidence anyone familiar with the voluminous literature on this topic will immediately recognize this as a revolutionary step the genre is crowded with speculation ranging from cautious the road to eleusis to extravagant food of the gods a scholar boasting phds in both ecology and religious studies letcher is also no stranger to the psychedelic underground in this book he painstakingly reconstructs mushroom theories ranging from eleusis to santa claus letcher is highly critical of most of these theories which he sometimes characterizes in sardonic terms that border on contemptuous although his tone can be caustic he pays mushroom enthusiasts the compliment of taking their arguments seriously and analyzing them as such shroom opens with a serviceable overview of the biology and chemistry of psychoactive mushrooms the book then moves into the cultural history of mushrooms including a valuable review of pre 1950s reports of mushroom use letcher documents and analyzes nearly every major argument written about psychoactive mushrooms in the last century he chronicles the channels by which a cloudy mix of science and speculation has flowed into the collective reservoir of the psychedelic underground

6192247 markets tumble as rogoff warns worst of credit crisis still to come
6192248 half time in the credit crisis and the score is only going to get worse
6192249 could we really only be half way through this cycle as mr rogoff suggests the answer is yes now that what started as a banking crisis has spread throughout the economy the first phase of this grim period was marked by disastrous losses on mortgage backed securities but now banks are facing up to a much more conventional source of write offs mounting bad debts on both sides of the atlantic unemployment is continuing to rise while house prices keep falling the result can only be further increases in the number of people unable to service the record levels of personal debt taken on over the past 10 years that means further pain for the financial sector further pressures on consumer confidence and further setbacks for sectors from construction to retail

6192369 upholding our islamic responsibility countering the ideologies that fuel terrorism
6192370 without muslims leading the effort to reject the ends of the islamic state and defend societies like america which are rooted in universal religious freedom and the separation of religion and government we will not see the ultimate defeat of militant islamists
6192371 aifd is founded upon the premise that it is our primary muslim responsibility to foster ijtihad modern interpretation of our scripture today that ijtihad must be focused on the rescue of spiritual islam from the clutches of political islamists we reject political islam regardless of whether muslims are a minority or a majority and we believe that when given the opportunity to bring this discourse to the mosque most devout muslims will agree that the most sacred and pure practice of islam is one which is wholly free and unencumbered by coercion or any mandate from the state or government
6192372 with the ever increasing threat of militant islamist terror it is imperative that the activist muslim community wake up and direct their valuable resources toward fighting the root cause of terrorism which arises from dreams of political islam
6192373 the reality is that our security is not threatened as much by the tactic of terrorism but more so by those individuals who are driven by the political ideology that feeds the mind set of radical islamism
6192374 the only effective counter terrorism is one that attacks the fuel and root cause of the islamist terrorists political islam and their dreams of an islamic state

6192387 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

6192410 i think its going to be a weaker quarter relative to last year which was a blowout quarter
6192411 long term i still think theyre very good investments but short term theres likely to be some more volatility in response to whats going on outside of canada as well as weaker earnings relative to expectations
6192412 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it

6192485 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
6192486 punishing wu and wang after they applied for protest permits and actively petitioned the government demonstrates that the official statements touting the new olympics protest zones as well as the permit application process were no more than a show
6192487 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked

6192505 i love my people and my homeland but a young person needs opportunities
6192506 these are far more abundant in the united states than in the besieged gaza strip

6192509 thankfully i have received support from people around the world journalists have wanted to hear my story the american officials who saw me in amman and jerusalem upon my return were friendly and seemed embarrassed by my predicament
6192510 the united states should use its tremendous sway with israel to advance the cause of freedom and equal rights for palestinians and israelis alike

6192520 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6192521 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling

6192529 currently were not really motivated to try to move wow to a console
6192530 the biggest thing is that wow wasnt designed for a console so retrofitting it would be a pretty serious challenge

6192562 what a match our bowling and fielding always keeps us in the hunt if only we had another 2 consistent batsmen other than sanga mahela and sanath to replace
6192563 badri should have been selected in the indian team 2 years back itself he is a prime example of selectors ignoring genuine talent and performance in domestic and a tours lesser batsmen got preference repeatedly over him perhaps the south zone selector in the selection panel has got something personal against him even for this series if he hadnt shouted after finally being fed up openly against selectors he wouldnt have got selected
6192564 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours
6192565 hes been performing consistently over the years back home and on india a tours it was reversing and turning a bit and at one end we had a batsman badrinath but the other end was open http content usa cricinfo com slvind content current story 365668 html

6192606 regardless of whether this has any impact on the ioc i think the important lesson here is that citizens dont have to rely on major institutions to get the news
6192607 i dont really feel that its about the gymnastics age limit or even really about whether fraud occurred
6192608 at this point i believe that any reasonable observer already understands that age records have been forged this story now is really about internet censorship the act of removing evidence while at the same time claiming that the evidence is wrong for the first time i watched search records shift under my feet like sand facts draining down a hole in the internet will this stand

6192627 its hard to push that specific negative story down in fact its almost impossible

6192629 some candidates now are putting together teams of bloggers to help optimize their positive web presence its becoming a major industry

6192634 the conservative right has defined our friends and enemies for too long unions lawyers bad the free market good its time to reclaim this we need to make the case that the poor and the middle class have a shared economic interest in a progressive agenda that a progressive immigration policy is in the best interest of the middle class that access to the courts and a muscular government prepared to regulate is in the best interests of all of us

6192639 i think the most important thing a musician can do is to connect with an audience
6192640 if you have an audience you can tour if you can tour you can make records its that simple remember that saying musicians would repeat at their gigs if it wasnt for you there would be no us well its true our fans and supporters are the best ever whenever ive been down they have lifted me up we worked hard and blanketed this country for the last 15 years bringing our music to every little town and big city in this country in all types of weather and its paid off

6192647 there was some literature put out by the national right to life committee and theyre basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill
6192648 well and because they have not been telling the truth
6192649 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade
6192650 i just read a copy of the illinois republican staff analysis on sb 1082 93rd general assembly and contrary to the bill status report on the illinois general assembly website it shows the bill as amended was in fact called for a vote in committee on a motion to recommend the bill for passage to the whole senate
6192651 that motion failed 4 6 0 along party lines and the chairman then state sen barack obama voted no the result is that the bill died in the committee
6192652 the amendment made my bill the same as the federal bill
6192653 i have full faith and confidence in what our files show absolutely
6192654 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal
6192655 the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion

6192678 this war cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement
6192679 we have to get back to the place we were where terrorists are not the focus of our lives but theyre a nuisance kerry was quoted as saying
6192680 as a former law enforcement person i know were never going to end prostitution
6192681 pre 9 11 view of the world another phrase that we have heard repeated by republican john mccains campaign in its comments on critics of the war including democratic rival barack obama
6192682 terrorism is not a law enforcement matter as john kerry repeatedly says terrorist activities are not like gambling terrorist activities are not like prostitution and this demonstrates a disconcerting pre september 11 mindset that will not make our country safer and that is what we see relative to winning the war on terror and relative to iraq

6192684 if i was teaching in westminster and i had a large korean or vietnamese population wed be doing exactly the same thing to support those students
6192685 those schools translate information into vietnamese and korean i find it interesting that the only negative attention is when its done to serve the hispanic population
6192686 i think people are frustrated with feeling like the english language has become second and not as important and its created a lot of divisiveness
6192687 we all want to live together and not separate i feel the biggest disservice here is being done to the hispanic children the cusd is culturally dividing those people the hispanic children have a tougher time unless they assimilate and assimilation will bring friendship
6192688 we would be damaging ourselves or limiting ourselves if we did not have outstanding school to home communication that disadvantage will impact the students and their performance
6192689 i cant believe how many people have contacted me and its all been positive
6192690 these children need to become americans and they can go home and speak spanish at home we are all americans in the public schools and thats what we speak english

6192701 i didnt think we did as good as wed like to do
6192702 there were a lot of opportunities missed out there and we just definitely need to get better we just have to break one more tackle make one more block
6192703 i dont know if we missed blocks or if we defended well early on
6192704 we need to run the football better but let me watch the tape and see why
6192705 i think our passing game is really good right now but we just have to get the running game going

6192710 we keep the pricing confidential since customer size and opportunity pricing varies we do resell and redistribute the certificates as part of our engagement
6192711 the original commitment that we made has been super successful and we have distributed more than 50 percent of it at this point
6192712 the agreement expires in january 2012 so we looked at our track record of success and we felt really conformable that we could make an incremental investment of up to 100 million
6192713 there are joint sales opportunities but there are also cases where novells sales force goes into an account and is involved in a back off against red hat
6192714 a point of differentiation for us is our interoperability with microsoft
6192715 customers have told us that they dont want to be experts in the area of intellectual property and they are just pleased that our two companies have built this bridge and taken the issue off the table
6192716 customers just like to hear its not an issue and they want to roll up their sleeves around the technical collaboration
6192717 it is clear that customers want linux were pleased to see novells linux business grow as well as the overall market for linux expand

6192721 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6192722 hes doing ok but i am sensing from what i am hearing that he is not as encouraged after his last outing sunday in minneapolis as he was his previous outing friday
6192723 i dont know but it looks like throwing to a catcher on saturday probably is backed up a little
6192724 i wouldnt say i am resigned but i guess i look at it as being kind of a gravy if he does return
6192725 i would love for him to pitch for us so there is a feeling going into the winter on how he feels but we cant make that happen
6192726 hes a work in progress and im sure hes feeling the difference between going three or four innings instead of one or 1 1 3
6192727 hes doing ok though he went up to 60 pitches in his last outing and will be in the 70s on thursday
6192728 i would say that he will go thursday and at least one more after that
6192729 you might have good results but you can still get in a habit and its a bad habit thats hard to break sometimes
6192730 its a feel thing it just takes getting comfortable on the mound i can go to the bullpen and get comfortable but like tuesday night the first few innings i felt like i was rushing everything i was just fighting mechanics the ball was running i hit a guy its like fighting a habit
6192731 i know what im doing wrong but its not easy to fix it
6192732 if your body doesnt feel comfortable its something you just have to get in repetition my mechanics are pretty simple i dont have a lot of movement but it doesnt take much to get out of whack
6192733 when you look at it when we lost those two guys we had to move everybody up and quite honestly it hasnt been good for our bullpen
6192734 the numbers reflect that but i think its good for them in the long run because it will make them better
6192735 and ive told our guys you cant be someone youre not
6192736 right now we have them pitching late in games and they are not accustomed to it
6192737 but the more experience you get doing it the better youre going to get but cesar jimenez or jake woods cant try to be arthur rhodes and any of our right handers cant be brandon morrow
6192738 j j is very very close to being back to where he was last year
6192739 we have to piece it together the rest of the way and hope the phone from the dugout doesnt ring as early as it has been this month
6192740 lefty righty he hit both ways everything feels good he played well
6192741 theres going to be times when its going to be a little sore but he says he feels great
6192742 everett is sore but probably can be used on wednesday
6192743 for eight outstanding youth organizations to come together for a national championship tournament thats a major achievement in itself to see these young players competing on the field this weekend will really be exciting
6192744 when youre not playing period i feel like i cant sit around cant sit still
6192745 im always moving around going to the back to the batting cage just to do something baseball wise
6192746 i liken that to a craig biggio kind of character he played hard every day was very very competitive hed dial up the intensity when he needed to and a good guy you hate for him to be going through what hes going through
6192747 when you mention mantle he really is an all time great
6192748 to be on that list weve talked about it its very surreal and humbling
6192749 on the other end its really cool to be talked about in that group
6192750 you appreciate the game itself and what those guys have done in the game we have a teammate on that list too its really cool to do that for sure
6192751 were going to let him play on a minor league rehabilitation assignment hes been out for so long
6192752 whether its the parade on opening day or whether its just watching these guys go toe to toe with a top four team in the country every bit of this experience has been super for me i wish i could put a uniform on
6192753 youre always going to have to go through some adversity
6192754 but its how you deal with adversity thats going to make you more successful as a person whatever it may be competitive sports marriage and life in general thats what im trying to teach em about being a tough individual

6192767 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
6192768 this research opens doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis of this prevalent disease
6192769 we found a different profile of chemicals above tumor sites relative to healthy skin
6192770 the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals

6192799 the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard after agreeing with them for the usual daily wage he sent them into his vineyard going out about nine oclock he saw others standing idle in the marketplace and he said to them you too go into my vineyard and i will give you what is just so they went off and he went out again around noon and around three oclock and did likewise going out about five oclock he found others standing around and said to them why do you stand here idle all day they answered because no one has hired us he said to them you too go into my vineyard when it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman summon the laborers and give them their pay beginning with the last and ending with the first when those who had started about five oclock came each received the usual daily wage so when the first came they thought that they would receive more but each of them also got the usual wage and on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner saying these last ones worked only one hour and you have made them equal to us who bore the days burden and the heat he said to one of them in reply my friend i am not cheating you did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage take what is yours and go what if i wish to give this last one the same as you or am i not free to do as i wish with my own money are you envious because i am generous thus the last will be first and the first will be last

6192808 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
6192809 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though

6192850 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of
6192851 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6192852 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6192853 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6192854 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6192855 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6192856 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6192857 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6192858 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6192859 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities

6192861 in essence the judge appears to conclude that fox retained distribution rights in watchmen through the 1991 largo quitclaim and he concludes that under the 1994 turnaround producer larry gordon acquired an option to acquire foxs remaining interest in watchmen that was never exercised thereby leaving fox with its rights under the 1994 agreement

6192864 the difference between the bible and an instruction book is the myriad of untestable and detestable claims the bible makes how do you know that if i sin i will go to hell only from the bible which is a source of such dubious credibility as to be laughable can you prove to me that any of what the bible claims about hell and sin is true can you prove to me that hell exists if not you along with all your pulpit pounding ilk are nothing more than a carnival ride of empty threats
6192865 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
6192866 the attempt to use the so called international justice against the country is an attempt to encourage rebel groups opposing peace to continue destruction and destabilisation to topple the regime in sudan
6192867 its own judicial institutions and is capable of trying anyone who violates justice
6192868 we will not hand over any sudanese citizen no matter what pressure there is even if we have to go to war
6192869 we are ready for war against the superpowers in order to protect sudanese citizens
6192870 that the suffering in darfur must definitely stop that human rights must be respected and that the sudanese government should make great efforts to that end

6192877 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6192878 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6192879 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6192880 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6192881 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6192882 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6192883 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6192884 the bill infringes on the authority of the commissioner of insurance as the regulating body of the insurance industry
6192885 creating an environment in which one individual has complete control of the regulation of the captive or alternative insurance market is not an effective means of regulating any market insurance related or otherwise
6192886 in reviewing the proposed legislation the initial reaction is that the bill is too large and cumbersome
6192887 it will scare potential companies considering locating in the united states virgin islands and the risk managers that promote various jurisdictions

6192910 we recognize the intent of the proposed legislation is to provide a temporary fix by making it possible for the non profits to be able to acquire bridge loans until grants that they are awaiting are received
6192911 while we do not have any problems in assisting in this manner we do have some concerns
6192912 the non profit should prove to the government development bank that they can meet all of the grant requirements prior to the disbursement of any loans funds
6192913 the grant should be sufficient in size to cover any interest that may accrue from the disbursement date of the bridge loan to the receipt of the grant funds by the government development bank
6192914 time may be better spent improving granting mechanisms than developing a loan program
6192915 while the government has demonstrated its commitment to economic development on the island of st croix and is committed to assisting this important and dynamic project the pfa does not have 34 3 million of uncommitted resources available at this time for a direct loan to crucian holdings
6192916 the restaurants and stores tell us that it really helps out it turns out to be one of the bigger weekends of the year for them so the local business owners seem to appreciate the festival being there
6192917 the short often lightsome essay is one of the greatest of literary and philosophical tools
6192918 from the competition she got a lot of pressure on her and she cant run under pressure she cant run relaxed
6192919 since she wasnt relaxed coupled with a long season im realizing that her body isnt responding when she wants to shift that gear
6192920 shes feeling good shes healthy and shes strong but when she goes to shift that gear the muscles for some reason are not responding at this point theres nothing she could do or try to do
6192921 in the prelims i saw relaxation going into the quarterfinals in the quarterfinals i saw nerves and a mental block as well a serous mental block
6192922 she needs more experience shes still a young athlete only 26 years old
6192923 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6192924 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6192925 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
6192926 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
6192927 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6192928 collapsed when she suffered a very serious brain hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm that burst in an inaccessible part of her brain
6192929 as far as were concerned shes still here until further notice and until the lord says its her time to go
6192930 but you know its so good it really doesnt need anything else at all
6192931 would you feel responsible for financially supporting a practically complete stranger
6192932 but i guess thats the difference between conservatives and liberals conservatives donate more time and money to charities yet get called uncompassionate by liberals who give less and expect the government to fix everything when its proven to be grossly inefficient
6192933 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6192934 what you do for the least amongst us you do for me
6192935 if i was a christian this is how i would act
6192936 the illinois senator mentions his brother in his autobiography describing him in just one passing paragraph as a
6192937 you can choose your friends but you cant choose your family
6192938 how long did it take you to think up that question
6192939 theres already been things out there in the media hes already made up his mind hes going to announce on such and such a day
6192940 i have not made the decision and were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres going to be another one of these firestorms obviously were going to be announcing soon because we have no choice but ive got to tell you its one of the toughest things ive ever done
6192941 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment
6192942 one of the least experienced candidates for president in the last 100 years
6192943 he wants to continue the same economic policies that has been doing for the last eight years
6192944 so my job in this election is to say i honor his service but i dont honor his policies and i dont honor his politics
6192945 the competition was very close the hardest competition ive ever been in
6192946 we did eight races and most of the time i ended up around 20th
6192947 going into the last day i was in 28th and we got three good races off because we were behind because of a lack of wind and i got top 20s in all those three races
6192948 i was really surprised to consistently be in the middle of the pack and a couple times i was far back and was able to make a comebacks so i was pretty excited
6192949 there were a couple of races where i was doing very well made one mistake and that cost me about five places so you have to maintain that type of intensity
6192950 he has beaten guys who have been to two maybe three olympics before and hes right up there theres no better experience than coming to the olympics and seeing who you will be competing against in the next three years
6192951 hell spend two more years in college sailing and if he decides to go to london in 2012 im sure hell do very well
6192952 its been great being in a different country experiencing a different culture and theres a lot to explore
6192953 nothing can beat this this is the icing on the cake and im glad that i had the opportunity to come to the olympics
6192954 i came in the shadow of my two boys and im proud of these guys i know their future is very bright they came out here did their best and im very pleased im expecting a lot from them in the future
6192955 it sent chills down my spine because here it is i have the opportunity i never did have and i always wanted
6192956 its a tremendous experience and i dont think you can ask for anything better
6192957 we have a big advantage over a lot of countries with our experience and how far we came im so glad to have my dad guiding us training us and still teaching us the right way to go
6192958 i would imagine that all the stimulus checks for those who timely filed will be out by the end of this month
6192959 during our demo we heard the phrase out with the neon multiple times
6192960 traffic just bounced out of the way with an occasional hood popping open here and there
6192961 if im still alive in the fall well have some good pears
6192962 the type of variant you have at this particular receptor the alpha 5 nicotinic receptor may actually predict whether or not you will do well on nicotine replacement therapy
6192963 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
6192964 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months

6192969 the key thing about this feather is not the fact that we found a feather but the fact of where it was located when we found it
6192970 this feather is located entwined in kathleen petersons hair and it is clutched in her left hand in the hair that was pulled out of the root from the ball of her head
6192971 at this point we do know that we have uncovered what we feel is a very explosive piece of physical evidence that is on her head that has never been tested and could possibly render exonerating evidence to mr peterson
6192972 now at first when you hear that it sounds ridiculous except when you look at the wounds when you look at the fact that these birds are in our neighborhood and that they have been there for years and years and years
6192973 that they have this kind of characteristics of their talons that they do this kind of damage
6192974 each cut was completely through the scalp and to the skull the science does not support it
6192975 because of deborah radischs findings thats why i could never entertain that theory
6192976 she was positive in her mind and during her testimony that this was a homicide
6192977 if you dont see the evidence if you dont see feel touch those talons its hard to believe that a bird would have done something like this
6192978 its hard to believe that we might have made an innocent mistake
6192979 but when you only have the evidence of a body there with a lot of blood and no other evidence its easy to kind of rush to judgment and say this person did it especially if you dont know a bird did it
6192980 theres already been so much time energy effort money spent on this one particular case that unless its a legitimate theory which i dont believe the owl theory is legitimate i think at some point in time you have to let the case go let it rest
6192981 the case is over as far as i m concerned and thats unfortunate for mr peterson
6192982 everyone is here to serve a purpose that is solely theirs
6192983 as you can see its raining really hard out here
6192984 then im going to be waiting for the weekend because im going to crash during that time
6192985 drogba will not be back before a month a month and a half
6192986 he has started to run but he will not be available for the match against qualifier september 5
6192987 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the
6192988 i never got to take my test because the company that was sponsoring me had some issues going on
6192989 one day i showed up to work and my boss was being handcuffed and put in a car they kind of locked down the place
6192990 i figured that was the end of my life insurance career
6192991 ive got good news and bad news the good news is you scored higher on the test than everybody the bad news is my dad wants to meet you and bring your playbook
6192992 i always enjoyed learning why we did the things we did offensively i always asked why sometimes the coaches maybe misunderstood me i wasnt really questioning them as much as i was just wanting to learn
6192993 i had told my wife awhile back that if mark gets a head job id like to go because i think great things could happen
6192994 if thats the only thing you can find thats wrong with him thats not bad
6192995 some people have to yell and scream to get their point across
6192996 some people have to exhibit certain animation mark knows who he is people respect him because of that hes the head coach but he doesnt have to tell anybody
6192997 i was kind of coaching off of past experiences and even fumes sometimes i didnt study the game on an ongoing basis like i normally do
6192998 which he did a very good job of but it got lost in the translation
6192999 i was listening i still wasnt seeing it in my mind quickly enough to make a change or make a call i would watch games afterward and id just think i cant believe we went the whole game and i didnt call this or do that id just be upset with myself
6193000 in the locker room at halftime if somethings not going right we need to get yelled at he definitely does that i think it just serves as an example for a lot of people that you can be passionate about something and yet stay calm and keep your head on your shoulders and stay levelheaded
6193001 we wanted to win the match and worked a lot to clinch the win
6193002 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6193003 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6193004 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6193005 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favors the guy thats had a good year
6193006 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all i think youll see somebody come deep and out of the pack that could actually win this thing if i understand it correctly i may not understand it correctly i dont know i really dont understand it anyway
6193007 this is my third pair of contact lenses in my left eye third one of the week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of it
6193008 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6193009 its a very long golf course its definitely going to be a week
6193010 driving it in the fairway is a premium but the driver is the strength of my game when im on with my driver i dont miss many fairways
6193011 i like westchester i think its a great golf course
6193012 i do feel as though ridgewood is a step up in quality its just a wonderful golf course ive always loved going to westchester but this course really has a major championship feel its a tillinghast same designer as winged foot same designer i believe as baltusrol very similar feel and it has that northeast major championship feel
6193013 the 18th hole doglegs right not left so thats a nice change
6193014 the rough is up and spotty in some spots where its real gnarly and laying all over the place
6193015 its going to be difficult if you hit it in the rough and the greens provide a challenge too because they are pretty severe in some spots and difficult
6193016 were very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6193017 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players

6193036 what the hell did you guys do last night i read it but what the
6193037 the in house video service run by the athletic department was seriously edited
6193038 i dont think thats something that we want to do thats why we close practice so that the other team cant see us we got on the internet to see if we could see any of clemsons plays from their scrimmage and didnt see any thats not what people usually do when youre getting ready to play a game to advertise on tv or the internet im not pleased about it but its something that can be corrected and it wont happen again
6193039 i attend all classes with an open mind and with a positive attitude to learn im excited to learn something new every day my education is important to me im committed to seizing the opportunities that have been given to me i maintain a 3 5 gpa i take the time to study realizing that it is the reiteration that helps me to assimilate what it is im learning
6193040 i am an excellent pass blocker my technique is perfect i stay low creating a solid base while establishing balance i sustain my blocks providing my qb time to complete every pass my drive blocking is outstanding i create holes in the defense by driving my opponent off the line of scrimmage i then use my body to wall off my opponent preventing him from making the tackle
6193041 i run my routes with precision i blow by the defender creating separation i look the ball into my soft but strong hands securing it and then i run to daylight i catch every ball thats thrown my way and i celebrate when my number is called because i am a big playmaker

6193055 i was able to steer us around and pick up vietnamese boat people at a time when they were being kidnapped for ransom by pirates well not literally pirates but guys who were on the high seas sometimes it would be oil tankers or somebody would pick them up and bring them back to the vietnamese government and get paid for it
6193056 its wild espn never sleeps it is a very demanding mistress
6193057 i for one think its a good idea i think itll be hard but i think its a good idea they way i look at this offense theyve only made two changes three if you count lj smith coming back from injury the two changes are lorenzo booker and desean jackson i for one have no idea why lorenzo booker is on this football team hes too light to play running back in the nfl hes about the same size as desean jackson and kevin curtis they already have two of those guys and im not sure why theyre going in this direction
6193058 i am not that way but i feel like what i was blessed with was determination
6193059 i was surprised that when i got into this sponsors didnt get behind the idea and come on board it was difficult when it felt i was the only one who really believed in this but gradually people started to realize it could be done
6193060 i was only a month or so away from defaulting on my mortgage
6193061 that was very stressful and i had to decide how badly i wanted this i decided to sell my house but that was when the market started to drop and i had to take 40 000 less than what it would normally have been appraised at
6193062 it wasnt until later that i realized how much that affected me

6193073 el precio final por el burley se acercar an a los 8 50 lo cual es una buena cifra esto tambi n es un buen mensaje para todos los que desviaron tabaco no asumiendo los compromisos que ten an con las acopiadoras de la provincia hoy se puede decir que los que contrabandearon perdieron
6193074 debido a que cobraron entre 4 y 6 pesos por el kilo de burley pensando que eso era mejor que lo que obtendr an en misiones
6193075 en brasil se comenz pagando entre 4 y 5 reales y para el fin del acopio reci n lleg a los 7 reales pero los compradores que se acercaban a la argentina no abonaban esa cifra
6193076 muchos van a seguir protestando contra este cultivo pero el tabaco este a o si se suman todos los conceptos se pagar 8 45 pesos por kilo
6193077 este valor final de 8 45 pesos va a constituir un lindo mensaje para aquellos que vendieron al exterior a 5 6 pesos el kilo de tabaco y nos dijeron de todo cuando nos sentamos en la mesa de concertaci n los productores el gobierno y las acopiadoras
6193078 los ingresos que se perdieron fueron considerables antes del inicio de la zafra se proyectaba un acopio cercano a los 41 millones de kilos pero por el desv o la campa a cerr con 35 280 412 kilos de burley y 730 273 de criollo

6193198 same thing though i thought they gave up a couple of big plays and thats always something you always want to guard against
6193199 there was a high difference with some of the young players from last week to this week thats going to be helpful to us from a depth standpoint
6193200 we have a bit of a long jam at running back and were a little thin at linebacker
6193201 we just talked to him yesterday about it well see how it goes at linebacker for a few days
6193202 we scrimmaged him out there some plays today probably didnt know what to do but he went up and tackled the guy with the ball quite a bit i did notice that well see how he develops and thats just kind of a trial right now
6193203 when you give up any big plays it kind of disturbs you
6193204 i think well be a faster unit you definitely see a difference in the guys and the attitude on the field in getting more guys to the ball
6193205 you wont see many times in which just one guy makes a tackle its your going to see a lot more guys swarming to the ball because thats something theyre emphasizing every day
6193206 they throw a deep ball and they want the defensive linemen to take off running you never know anything could happen fumble anything
6193207 he has made a significant improvement in weight management discipline
6193208 hes in the 365 range i think we wanted him at 366 365 i dont know that hes going to be able to lose a whole lot more weight than that right now its his conditioning and his ability to sustain
6193209 hes a presence in the middle and pushes the pocket hes difficult to block hes made a contribution to the defense in the middle theres no question about that especially on run downs

6193247 the 2008 report shows some states and communities have taken positive steps but overall we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the seriousness it deserves
6193248 this is the fifth annual report and with each and every year we see more evidence the obesity epidemic is gaining speed and destructive force
6193249 the resources devoted to improving the health of our families and our children remain too few and too ineffective
6193250 the federal government continues to cut its own effective programs at the federal level the only obesity number going down is the number of dollars being spent to end the epidemic

6193257 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6193258 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6193259 we recognize that more and more people are turning to new media and as a result new media has become a powerful driving force
6193260 were providing access to resources and platforms to discuss politics and sustainability we made it a non partisan event and bloggers that have access to our tent represent this for example we have people from daily kos and we also have bloggers from the heritage foundation completely different sides of the spectrum
6193261 theres a small part of the space sponsored by google that is accessible by people
6193262 but the majority of the tent will be for credentialed bloggers only the second floor of the tent will be the media lounge and nobody but the credentialed people will be allowed up there the ground floor will have a bit more multi use so it will have a little more accessibility but nonetheless there will only be a limited number of spots for those who dont have reservations
6193263 basically i just wanted to be there at this historic event
6193264 i wanted to be part of it both as a podcaster and also to shoot video ive got the gear i know how to use it and im pretty good at interviewing i thought why not just place myself in the middle of it and see what stories develop
6193265 i think the more voices that are in the conversation the richer the dialog is going to be
6193266 the big thing with bloggers is there is no gatekeeper youre not hearing the message of the day youre hearing it as it happens depending on the level of expertise and the talent its like having an eyewitness for you what i love about the big tent is that they were so open to diversity
6193267 i really want to focus on some of our local or state stories
6193268 for instance not only is nevada a swing state my county is considered the swing county in the state also we have the possibility of electing our first all female congressional delegation which is really exciting
6193269 im sure theres going to be plenty of opportunities to focus on the west since its in colorado
6193270 democratic candidates from new mexico are going to be over there and im going to try to talk to them actually something weve been doing on our blog a lot lately is podcasts through blog talk radio its basically just an online radio show that people can listen to live and can call into
6193271 any learned critical thinking reasoned human being would realize that this is a charade to sugar up and pacify the progressive community
6193272 its going to be a different group of people that are there there wont be as much bumping into the congressmen in the hallway itll be more of networking with other bloggers that does have a lot of value too its just going to be different i think
6193273 do you think itll be less value at all because the bloggers are not going to be on the ground in the convention
6193274 i think that having worked for a number of candidates and elected officials i think they have their own sort of agendas and mostly theyll want to network with each other while theyre there
6193275 but i would not be surprised if some of them reserved some time to come talk to the media i just dont honestly believe that everyone is going to come out to the big tent i dont think they will also a lot of people dont understand the power of the blogosphere so they may or may not be that tapped into it quite yet
6193276 they have been very good about explaining their whole process of applying
6193277 and theyve been very good about getting back to us like we had one person in our group who applied under a different blog name and due to a family emergency she wont be able to be there we wanted to see if we could still use the pass for the group and theyre working with us to figure out a way to do that theyve been very responsive and very helpful i think

6193280 its all about niches now weve always been birminghams business paper but that will become even more evident the truth is that without these changes the post would be in real trouble
6193281 this should have happened five or six years ago but successive managements and editors put it off were only doing what every other news group is doing or will be doing in the very near future
6193282 despite the gloss put on it by trinity mirror todays announcement represents a massive blow to journalism in the midlands
6193283 the nuj condemns these cuts which will inevitably hit these papers and the communities they serve hard
6193284 it just goes to show how little the company values its readers in comparison to the demands of the city
6193285 whatever the company may claim you simply cant take dozens of journalists out of your local operations and continue to report news to the same standard
6193286 this is a deeply uncertain time for journalists working across all the titles affected its also a very bad day for people in the midlands who genuinely care about their community

6193294 central corridors competing with 10 other projects that are in the same position we are
6193295 and that helps us compete very well on the financing side
6193296 with the current system where were relying on property taxes they werent paying for the operation of that line
6193297 so i think it reflects the regional nature of these lines and the regional nature of the customers who use them
6193298 it is the longest running and most experienced antiques and collectibles site on the internet and has a great staff
6193299 our acquisition of goantiques will accelerate our growth by introducing the antique dealer community to worthpoint
6193300 more importantly it will introduce thousands of antique dealers to the thousands of homeowners who come to the worthpoint site daily looking to sell some of their possessions
6193301 fifteen years ago my dream was to serve the antiques market with jim as president weve come a long way and now with worthpoint we can go even further
6193302 this is a good match worthpoint will give us the added resources we need to expand our marketplace and provide additional value to our buyers and sellers the people looking for assistance with estates and collections who come to our site will benefit greatly from having access to worthpoints rapidly expanding team of experts
6193303 worthpoint represents the future of collecting worldwide and we are happy to be part of that exciting future

6193329 the city council have been aware of unisons intention to ballot since may 2008 on 31 july 2008 i wrote to the city council to make unisons position clear
6193330 the city council have stated that the offer cannot remain on the table indefinitely especially as the unions are actively promoting litigation against the council
6193331 this is an unbelievable statement to make clearly our members expect their union to whom they pay their subscriptions to promote legal cases as and where appropriate and you would expect and deserve nothing less from us
6193332 in conclusion it is incredulous sic that the city council has taken up this position when there are only six weeks left until the end of september and the end of the talks around progression arrangements are in sight
6193333 i also remain mystified at the stance the city council has taken in expecting unison to hold a ballot before discussions around the most integral and disputed part of the improved offer have been exhausted questions need to be asked now as to why this action has been taken
6193334 certainly she is in all of our prayers i think people all over the nation who know her and love her as i do are sending up prayers on her behalf

6193348 it seems that their mind is focused on the permatang pauh umno division campaign they are giving the impression that this by election is a gone case and they would rather prepare for their own party polls
6193349 im worried that if this trend continues it will reflect badly again on umno and bn when i watch the tv news our leaders are all out campaigning against anwar but on the ground theres not much being done
6193350 if we lose badly again people will get more fed up with us
6193351 im confident that the voters in permatang pauh are smart enough to differentiate between propaganda and the truth we know that bn is desperate not just about anwar winning this by election but what will happen on sept 16

6193357 the unions have tried repeatedly to get the council to withdraw this issue stating weekly to monthly should be on a voluntary basis but this has fallen once again on deaf ears
6193358 this means low paid women workers taking home as little as 40 a week will have to wait a month before they are paid from november 2008 leaving many having to struggle to pay for their christmas shopping until the last minute
6193359 could cause thousands of low paid women to be forced into financial difficulties by taking the offer of a loan which will then be paid back leading up to christmas and early in the new year as they struggle to make ends meet whilst the city council could earn a huge sums of money as it gains interest as the unpaid weekly wages sit in the councils coffers

6193382 they say english education is too focused on grammar here and i think that perhaps education or student teacher relations in general are grammar oriented rather than conversational my character in the film thus approaches students in a more realistic conversing way

6193390 i looked out of my bedroom window and saw the coach flying through the air and landing
6193391 the coach was coming from the driveway down into the garden and turning onto its side and then crash landing into the garden
6193392 you just dont expect the coach to land in the garden
6193393 there was lots of screaming and shouting and crying and lots of blood
6193394 as soon as the coach had landed i had got on the phone to 999 and got my son to grab loads of towels

6193397 were at the dawn of a new era delivering rich internet applications with the power of web 2 0
6193398 we realize that there have been many attempts to bring internet to the tv with limited success remember web tv but what the difference is now is bringing the full richness of the internet to televisions
6193399 we think in order to address the mass market of television we need a purposeful foundation viiv was not a purposeful foundation
6193400 essentially were merging the content of the cinematic internet with the tv in a way thats never been done before
6193401 its a real category not a novelty and it can transform the business
6193402 a more full featured area in which applications can run in all their glory
6193403 today we still spend five times as much money on television as we do on the internet
6193404 fundamentally however everyone sees the same ad which is not the best kind of targeting initiative and there is a limited ability to delve into content this changes the whole accountability
6193405 it puts the tv on an equal footing with the internet
6193406 there never has been any 3d graphics in this space before and we think it opens up some dramatic new opportunities

6193419 it was just flat out wrong you should have known better and shame on you
6193420 would you have these folks go back and redo all that conduit

6193427 increasingly fannie mae and freddie mac are looking like little more than devices to transfer money from the pockets of taxpayers to the pockets of fannie and freddie senior executives
6193428 executives receiving very high pay justify their deals on two grounds that they are risk takers in high pressure situations and that they have valuable expertise
6193429 and just what incredible expertise do syron and mudd possess
6193430 this is the core lesson of ceo overpay scandals the corrupt or incompetent executive always keeps the money
6193431 why does congress tolerate the swindle aspect of fannie and freddie for the standard reason congress is on the take
6193432 now that taxpayers are covering fannie and freddies cooked books the 200 million diverted to congress in effect came from average americans forcibly removed from their pockets and thanks to senator reid more will be forcibly taken from your pocket and placed into the accounts of senators and representatives this is what tmq calls a sliver strategy the sliver strategy is a means to disguise embezzlement congress looked the other way while fannie and freddie approved vast amounts of bad debt in order to shave off a sliver for itself in this case the 200 million in lobbying and donations had congress simply awarded itself 200 million editorialists would have been outraged because the money was slipped in to a larger fiasco of much greater sums wasted congress got away with it

6193473 as a former law enforcement person i know were never going to end prostitution
6193474 pre 9 11 view of the world another phrase that we have heard repeated by republican john mccains campaign in its comments on critics of the war including democratic rival barack obama
6193475 terrorism is not a law enforcement matter as john kerry repeatedly says terrorist activities are not like gambling terrorist activities are not like prostitution and this demonstrates a disconcerting pre september 11 mindset that will not make our country safer and that is what we see relative to winning the war on terror and relative to iraq

6193520 the in house video service run by the athletic department was seriously edited
6193521 i dont think thats something that we want to do thats why we close practice so that the other team cant see us we got on the internet to see if we could see any of clemsons plays from their scrimmage and didnt see any thats not what people usually do when youre getting ready to play a game to advertise on tv or the internet im not pleased about it but its something that can be corrected and it wont happen again

6193555 there are five environments you can live in on this planet theres the city the desert the mountains the plains and the beach

6193571 despite an exhaustive search docs case workers were unable to place the child somewhere he would be kept safe as a result the child was accommodated in a local motel from wednesday august 13 with around the clock supervision by docs case workers who volunteered to help
6193572 however the young boy has had a difficult start to life and can exhibit extremely challenging behaviours in this instance they resulted in significant property damage and a decision was made that remaining in the motel room left the boy at risk to himself and private property
6193573 as a last resort he stayed at the docs office from saturday august 16 under the constant supervision of two workers while docs continued the search for a suitable alternative
6193574 the boy is now safe with a docs foster carer who is being offered special supports to cope with his behaviour
6193575 this was an extraordinary situation and docs acknowledges that accommodating a child in a docs office is unacceptable
6193576 the union has intervened to try to fix the problem the department says this is not normal practice and we accept that but if this case continues it could become an industrial issue and we will take it to a local members meeting tomorrow

6193600 and started writing songs that i cared about i just needed to find myself in some kind of way somehow it turned into a full fledged project
6193601 ben folds was the primary songwriter for that other band so i think thats the big difference this sound of hotel lights is something ive been doing since about 2000 just kind of refining it and working on it
6193602 basically it was something fun for me to do to step outside from my usual routine with hotel lights
6193603 trying to write for characters in a musical but then i would hear the song and i thought i can actually pull this off too so that how it kind of ended up on the album
6193604 some of our hardcore fans had been excited about that song for a while
6193605 i always liked the song and i always wanted to do something with it it seemed enough time had gone by and i always wanted to record a version on my own
6193606 i dont think i knew what i was getting into
6193607 i just wanted to sit around with my headphones and write songs on my 4 track its been a really fun transition and enough years have gone by now that i have a great band
6193608 the admission by keith talley political director for the house democratic caucus that he illegally entered the offices of house republican leaders late during the night to anonymously leave records aimed at intimidating a republican legislative candidate has intensified the need for an independent investigation
6193609 the public deserves the confidence of an investigation into this culture of corruption by an outside agency with no ties to the bredesen administration or the tennessee democratic machine
6193610 these are just the types of tactics that turn people off to politics it is clear that the democrat party is very comfortable in embracing dirty tricks and illegal activities as part of their standard operating procedure
6193611 we see this as a great concept that will make an exciting series for worldwide audiences

6193621 great moment on the today programme this morning when john major without irony told james naughtie how great the national lottery was because an opera lover like him could benefit from the money poured into the royal opera house in covent garden
6193622 w hy have british taxpayers subsidise the singing of songs written a hundred years ago in italian or german if the usually rich people who tend to watch opera do not wish to fund the real cost of it i have never seen why hard pressed taxpayers should cover a chunk of the ticket price

6193630 many books have a very limited audience the 20 000 copies sold to libraries may end up being a huge portion of the sales the books make libraries then are more friends to the publishers than potential enemies this ties into 1 a really popular book is only going to loose so many sales to the libraries those few lost sales are probably worth it to publishers since the libraries represent millions in sales of less popular books

6193639 the variety of greek spanish and british actors struggle manfully against unspeakable dialogue in english and a dreadful screenplay in which the narrator tells you throughout what you can see it never for a moment suggests what made el greco a great painter and an upbeat ending is one that even hollywood at its most puerile would have turned down

6193643 a meandering first half gives way to a spectacular psychological portrait of the deafening silence of pain and loneliness in austrian writer director g tz spielmanns revanche
6193644 revanche starts out in ulrich seidl territory among a group of russian and ukrainian prostitutes held prisoner in a viennese brothel but soon shifts gear becoming something else entirely first a doomed love story then a drama of revenge and redemption one whose stifling provincialism and inexorable sense of fate recalled nothing so much as fassbinders the merchant of four seasons
6193645 revanche shows just how successfully one can transpose the plot and character based drama of hollywood to the refined style of european art house cinema without hampering it with a sense self importance

6193657 with our readers its not directly about aliyah but it touches on one of the most important issues imo as a conservative jew on the subject namely the public funding and by extension legitimacy of non orthodox stream of judaism in israel
6193658 this claims moral ground for these movements and moral ground is important for them it is not just a matter of money but a symbol of legitimacy for non orthodox judaism

6193680 my group has been investigating what we believe is another taste quality calcium
6193681 there isnt a better word for it it is bitter perhaps even a little sour but its much more because there are actual receptors for calcium not just bitter or sour compounds
6193682 but at levels much above that the taste becomes increasingly bad
6193683 many animals have a specific calcium appetite which implies they can detect the mineral and consume sufficient quantities of it to meet their needs
6193684 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly
6193685 the pwk strain drank about four times more calcium than water
6193686 we can now say with some certainty that calcium is tasted
6193687 hopefully we wont have to be sitting by as somebody dies to wait to chop their tongues off were not ambulance chasers there are cases where people have cancer of the tongue and have to get them removed
6193688 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
6193689 tweaking its taste could encourage a calcium deficient population to consume more of this key nutrient
6193690 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6193691 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out

6193704 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent the letter states
6193705 we had high expectations for the 2008 season the letter states
6193706 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6193707 your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6193708 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6193709 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers
6193710 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top

6193716 they had a special relationship that this court considers more than typical
6193717 in fact on the very night mrs gunvalson and her son were staying at the home of a ptc employee another patients parent was staying with her as well
6193718 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community
6193719 our relationship with the parents of patients should be taken as evidence of our commitment to the community rather than as evidence of some promise of special treatment
6193720 if we do there is serious risk no patients will want to participate in our current clinical trials in which they might receive a placebo rather than ptc124

6193873 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6193874 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6193875 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6193876 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians

6193900 en esta regi n el fanatismo de matriz hinduista usa la religi n solo como un pretexto para realizar estos cr menes entre nosotros los cat licos y los religiosos hind es moderados no hay enfrentamiento cuando el di logo tiene que ver con los valores del esp ritu los enfrentamientos son creados por quienes usan pretextos pseudo religiosos
6193901 los fieles de mi di cesis con frecuencia viven en condici n de terror aqu lo cat licos est n en una minor a verdaderamente heroica y significativa en la parroquia en donde ocurri el asesinato son solo cinco familias las que se declaran cat licas por ello acudir regularmente a los servicios religiosos es ahora un riesgo serio
6193902 los campesinos de las reas rurales deben obedecer solo a los latifundistas que son de fe hind ser cristianos y ser en particular cat licos es una elecci n muy valerosa pero una elecci n que pone en riesgo la vida propia y la de los familiares

6193915 so you can imagine what i thought when i first came in here and looked around not exactly the greatest place to start a new church where an old one had failed
6193916 when i first began to pray about planting a new church in laurinburg the opposition which i encountered was a bit shocking
6193917 there have been two new churches planted here in the last decade one of them failed
6193918 why whats wrong with us we arent meeting your needs
6193919 it was very hard to get people in my home church of stewartsville baptist to see that their impact and influence was critical to the success of any new church
6193920 and that is the fastest way to kill a new church from the very start
6193921 we are a congregation that is dependent on the strong foundation of a sponsoring church where a group from an existing congregation approaches starting a church much like a missionary prepares for the mission field
6193922 disgruntled and disappointed pastors go to re start their ministries
6193923 i grew up methodist but when i finally heard and understood the command of jesus i knew i couldnt turn back from fully following him
6193924 i see this opportunity as one of being a missionary to laurinburg
6193925 it was during that time i was challenged to read the bible through from front to back to really read it
6193926 out of the box focused and not willing to do anything which will cause others to miss the gospel
6193927 people must be impacted by the word of god or all of this is for nothing
6193928 the cooperative program is one of the main ways which southern baptist churches help plant new churches and without the investment given us by the denomination we couldnt be where we are at this point in time
6193929 we look for new ways to involve ourselves into the community in ways which would cause others to take a look at us and listen to what we are saying
6193930 many have preconceived ideas of what church might be and we want to reach out in ways which would make our church a multi racial church with a strong emphasis on the gospel
6193931 i knew the lord was calling me home to help plant this congregation and i knew until that was done i would not find fulfillment in anything else
6193932 im finding that we are ready even as a young church to partner with other believers to reach out to people who have never understood the gospel
6193933 the brilliant employees used an instrument located just below the cockpit window that is critical to the operation of the onboard computers

6193936 on the supply side the industry is not producing enough so we are going to see an improvement of goods in the market
6193937 we should also export thereby earning the country the much needed foreign currency if our industry were operating at a full scale then we might have a greater market share

6193947 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6193948 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6193949 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6193950 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6193951 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent

6193982 no desecho la gracia de dios pues si por la ley fuese la justicia entonces por dem s muri cristo
6193983 porque la ira de dios se revela desde el cielo contra toda impiedad e injusticia de los hombres que detienen con injusticia la verdad

6193993 as anarchists we feel the greatest problem with government is how its primary interest is to protect the profits of those in power even when it comes at the expense of the general public
6193994 spending 50 million dollars on weaponry to attack people voicing their opinion and flooding the streets with riot police while schools close down children go without health care and people lose their homes is exactly the problem with the corrupt two party system were opposing this august
6193995 thats what were working towards a world where peoples basic needs are met and those most affected by the issues at hand are the ones that have the most say
6193996 when you look at the dnc you see that the opposite is true instead of our needs being met our city is being militarized and instead of the people who have the most at stake making decisions in the convention its the corporations and party insiders living it up behind a wall of heavily armed police
6193997 if the city agrees to fund peoples needs instead of corporate greed and suppressing dissent ill be spending my free time catching up on some books and being with my family

6194006 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself

6194114 both before and after lasik the difference of the mean cct between non contact specular microscopy and ultrasound pachymetry was statistically significant
6194115 a contact lens that could continuously measure pressure within the eye and relay the data to a computer would allow doctors to learn more about glaucoma and improve patient treatment
6194116 several parameters were statistically correlated with keratoconus suspect defined by higher asymmetry and steeper curvature on placido topography

6194131 trabeculectomy rates have recently declined and implantation of glaucoma drainage devices is playing an increasingly important role in glaucoma management
6194132 in canada laser trabeculoplasty rates have risen significantly over recent years
6194133 trabeculectomy rates have recently declined and implantation of glaucoma drainage devices is playing an increasingly important role in glaucoma management in this country
6194134 laser trabeculoplasty rates dramatically increased between 2001 and 2004 with the national canadian rate more than doubling
6194135 however this increase varied widely across regions ranging from 0 to 530
6194136 trabeculectomy surgery rates slowly increased from 1992 to 1995 then declined by 29 nationally between 1995 and 2004
6194137 implantation rates of glaucoma drainage devices increased 12 fold nationally between 1992 and 2004 by 2004 this procedure accounted for 10 of incisional glaucoma surgical procedures in canada
6194138 new laser and surgical techniques have had a significant effect on glaucoma therapy
6194139 a precise understanding of how these developments are affecting overall glaucoma management is fundamental to health services planning
6194140 the objective of this study was to synthesize canadian national and provincial data regarding glaucoma laser and surgical procedure rates from 1992 to 2004
6194141 canadian provincial health insurance databases which cover virtually all surgical procedures provided domestically to canadians were accessed to ascertain yearly total glaucoma procedure numbers
6194142 to estimate the number of individuals with glaucoma an age stratified glaucoma prevalence model was applied to population census data

6194367 one way in which scripture emphasizes the cost of the cross is to contrast the indignity to which christ descended on earth with the glory from which he came god the son the immortal self existent word of god who from eternity had dwelt in unapproachable light took the nature of a servant veiled in human flesh made in human likeness this jesus suffered the indignity of accusation and condemnation and the shame of crucifixion his was the tortured soul in gethsemane the torn flesh at calvary and as thick darkness enveloped the whole land it was he who was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities his was the punishment that brought us peace his were the wounds that wrought our healing the lord jesus christ did not come into the world to meet with his friends he came to die for his enemies he came to a people who had rejected his law and killed his prophets who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else trampling his courts in the hypocrisy of their self righteous observances he came to nations that had exchanged the truth of the living god for a lie the glory of the immortal god for man made images and the fountain of living water for cracked and broken cisterns he came to a world stained with violence to a people whose hands were full of blood and whose righteous deeds were like filthy rags to a complacent humanity who proclaimed peace peace while they waged war with god this is the biblical portrait of the people for whom christ died we were objects of wrath rightly facing the unmitigated everlasting fury of an incensed god but now in christ we have found mercy we were slaves to sin the world and the devil but are now adopted children of our heavenly father we were stained with the filth of a wicked life and tormented by the pain of a guilty conscience but are now pardoned and forgiven standing blameless before him as a pure bride clothed in the clean white robes of christs righteousness now contemplate the blistering holiness of our god the holy one of israel the high and lofty one who inhabits eternity his eyes are too pure to look on evil his voice shakes the heavens at his sight the angels in glory hide their faces who can dwell with this consuming fire with this everlasting burning who can ascend the hill of the lord who can stand in his holy place yet this god took pity on us this god stooped down to us and lifted us up to enjoy the blessing of restored relationship with him that we may gaze upon his face for all eternity what love it is that this holy god should give his son his only son his beloved to suffer and die in the place of rebels he gave him not hoping that he might be spared but knowing that he would be despised rejected and killed and as he turned his face away from his son in the blackness of golgotha he turned towards us a people loaded with guilt children given to corruption and fulfilled those precious words god so loved the world that he gave his only son scripture magnifies gods love by its refusal to diminish our plight as sinners deserving of gods wrath and by its uncompromising portrayal of the cross as the place where christ bore that punishment in the place of his people if we blunt the sharp edges of the cross we dull the glittering diamond of gods love

6194539 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
6194540 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
6194541 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
6194542 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
6194543 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
6194544 would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union
6194545 people are going to begin to wonder if russia can be trusted
6194546 we have to invent a new language with regard to russia that is what the european union is trying to do
6194547 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
6194548 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
6194549 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory
6194550 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
6194551 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
6194552 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6194553 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
6194554 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
6194555 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
6194556 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
6194557 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
6194558 we cannot and will not pretend that the eu will continue doing business as usual with moscow this aggression has damaged the eu russian partnership
6194559 the eu should evaluate whether it is possible to continue in an unaltered way the post pca talks negotiations on a new eu russia treaty visa dialogue or other cooperation activities
6194560 we have seen some disagreements between eu member states on many occasions including the georgia issue still it does not create a deep rift
6194561 nato refusing to grant a map membership action plan for georgia and ukraine at the bucharest summit made a principle mistake we can say that it partly led to the situation that we have in georgia today
6194562 by giving a map to georgia and to ukraine we would clearly show to russia how unhelpful it is to even try flexing its muscles
6194563 the eu visa facilitation issue for georgia will have to be raised further as well as a preparation of a comprehensive free trade agreement
6194564 we are against cruelty we are against ethnic cleansing a right to come back home should be guaranteed to the refugees we all agree that murders property destruction annihilation of culture and religion are not to be tolerated that is what we are fighting against bombardments of the aggressor will be mercilessly intensified
6194565 we appeal to all free countries to join us but our actions are not determined by others i will defend the freedom and security of my citizens whatever actions are needed for it our special forces have seized airports and bridges air forces and missiles have struck essential targets
6194566 take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the area
6194567 team of 15 civil emergency planning experts to help georgia assess damage to its civil infrastructure
6194568 support the re establishment of the air traffic system and assist the georgian government in understanding the nature of cyber attacks
6194569 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words
6194570 i think we should still engage with the russians but in a hard headed way and we mustnt allow the russians to feel they are the victims of this affair when they are the transgressors
6194571 for the withdrawal of russian troops to happen two things are necessary the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again russias ambassador to the united nations vitaly churkin said
6194572 theyre targeting a similar customer base and they bothhave that appeal being discounters in a difficult market sothey can grab some customers from mid tier retailers who aredoing fairly poorly
6194573 doing a better job of appealing tocustomers as being the cheapest option people are biting on tothat concept given the pressures in the economy
6194574 we believe the market will become increasingly concernedabout the credit card business in the quarters ahead especially given uncertainty in the financial sector

6194604 the 2008 report shows some states and communities have taken positive steps but overall we are not treating the obesity epidemic with the seriousness it deserves
6194605 this is the fifth annual report and with each and every year we see more evidence the obesity epidemic is gaining speed and destructive force
6194606 the resources devoted to improving the health of our families and our children remain too few and too ineffective
6194607 the federal government continues to cut its own effective programs at the federal level the only obesity number going down is the number of dollars being spent to end the epidemic

6194677 the question of who is more chinese is always a difficult one
6194678 but one thing that has been clear is that there has long been a bias especially in the prc against any chinese who seem to have run under the skirts of foreigners that may explain chius curious erasure

6194702 few people of our generation have reflected with so much transparency the meek and humble face of jesus christ
6194703 his death wrought by a mentally disturbed woman during a liturgical celebration reminded me of the words of the prophet isaiah about the servant of god mistreated he allowed himself to be humiliated and did not open his mouth he was as a lamb being led to the slaughter as a mute lamb before its shearer
6194704 in a turbulent age for the church and the christian faith brother roger was a source of hope recognized by many including myself
6194705 he was convinced that only an ecumenism nourished by the word of god and the celebration of the eucharist by prayer and contemplation would be able to bring together christians in the unity desired by jesus
6194706 gladly accepting every action that could bring christians of different tradition closer avoiding any word or gesture that might delay their reconciliation
6194707 for me the fact that every year thousands of young people continue to follow the road to the little hill of taiz is truly a gift of the holy spirit for the church today
6194708 i am happy to see that every summer young people from different countries of western and eastern europe belonging to communities of protestant catholic and orthodox tradition pitch their tents in taiz often they are accompanied by their priests or pastors
6194709 how a parable of unity helps to overcome the splits of the past
6194710 i think that many young people realize what is at stake in regard to the unity of christians they know how the weight of divisions makes the witness of christians and the building of a new society difficult
6194711 already from his youth nourished his faith and spiritual life from the sources of other christian traditions thus crossing over certain confessional limits his desire to follow a monastic vocation and with that intention to found a new community with reformed christians says much about this search
6194712 the faith of the prior of taiz was enriched with the patrimony of the faith of the catholic church according to his own testimony referring precisely to the mystery of the catholic faith he understood certain elements of the faith such as the role of the virgin mary in the history of salvation the real presence of christ in the eucharistic gifts and the churchs apostolic ministry in response the catholic church accepted his access to communion
6194713 received communion on many occasions from the hands of john paul ii who had a bond of friendship with him since the time of the second vatican council and who was familiar with his journey in the catholic faith
6194714 in this connection there was nothing secret or concealed in the posture of the catholic church either in taiz or in rome
6194715 reconciling in himself the faith of his origins with the mystery of the catholic faith without breaking communion with anyone
6194716 in his conscience he had entered into the mystery of the catholic faith as one who grows without the need to abandon or break with what he had received or lived before
6194717 out of respect for the journey of faith of the prior of taiz it would be preferable in his case not to apply categories that he considered inappropriate for his experience and that moreover the catholic church never wished to impose on him
6194718 on one hand the prior of taiz felt very close to the bishops of rome in their concern to lead the church of christ on the path of spiritual renewal christian unity service to the poor and witness of the gospel
6194719 profoundly understood and supported by the popes in his personal spiritual journey and in the direction that the young community of taiz was taking
6194720 act in harmony with the thought of the bishop of rome was for him a compass in all his actions
6194721 he would never have implemented an initiative that went against the opinion or will of the pope
6194722 but theyre new so these ladies are a little rough around the edges and theyre still a little boyish thats the attraction though theyre all new to the scene but theyre all training and aspiring to be the ultimate transsexual isnt the quest for the best always an admirable goal

6194753 there are roughly 23 million businesses in the united states so to be recognized just once on inc s list is a crowning achievement for any ceo
6194754 but to be recognized five times with three companies is incredible and just goes to show you what an important part strong leadership plays in any business
6194755 there isnt that much difference in maturity between twenty one and eighteen if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
6194756 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6194757 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6194758 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6194759 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6194760 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6194764 celebrity spokespeople have long been a favorite marketing tool of companies with products or services to sell some stars fit the bill so perfectly that they became nearly synonymous with the brands they were paid to pitch
6194765 famous for his role as captain kirk in star trek shatner plays the negotiator who uses his unusual but effective persuasion skills to negotiate the best travel deals for priceline
6194766 were pleased to see william shatner receive this recognition because he truly has become synonymous with the priceline com brand

6194774 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
6194775 because he was religious because he was christian and because he was charitable to the poor
6194776 was killed because the catholic missionaries are on the side of the poor in this region in which there still exists a harsh form of servitude in the agricultural industry land owners do not recognize the rights of farm workers and make use of fanatical hindu gangs to put a stop to any improvement to the living conditions of the rural population
6194777 in this region hindu inspired fanaticism uses religion only as a pretext for carrying out these crimes
6194778 between us catholics and moderate hindus there is no confrontation when it comes to dialogue about the values of the spirit the confrontations are created by those who use pseudo religious pretexts
6194779 the faithful of my diocese often live in fear here catholics are a truly heroic and significant minority at the parish where the killing took place only five families openly declare themselves to be catholic for this reason regular attendance at religious services is now a serious risk
6194780 farm workers in rural areas are only supposed to obey land owners who are of the hindu faith to be christian and catholic in particular is a very courageous choice but a choice that puts ones life and that of ones family at risk

6194809 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly
6194810 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul
6194811 well err on the side of safety well defend the official who may be a little more strict because thats a major point of emphasis

6194830 los romanos han perdido la buena costumbre de disfrutar el sonido de las campanas los domingos por la ma ana o de despertarse al son de stas
6194831 por el contrario para muchas personas las campanas se han convertido en una molestia y ahora la ley restringe su sonido exactamente igual que si formaran parte de un sistema de alarma
6194832 si alguien en la parroquia se queja del ruido y dice que le causa angustia o da os la polic a puede mandar a detener las campanas
6194833 no hace mucho las campanas de las iglesias indicaban que uno ten a que ir a trabajar o regresar a almorzar en la casa al mediod a pero todo eso ha cambiado

6194872 but they can also be taken away at any time
6194873 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6194874 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6194875 we have no records of these two names in our system
6194876 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6194877 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6194878 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6194879 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6194880 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6194881 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6194882 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6194883 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6194884 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6194885 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6194886 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6194887 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6194888 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6194889 we used to meet him there in the past but with no official duties he was completely different
6194890 it is time to put the pervez musharraf phenomena behind us
6194891 a failure to hold musharraf and the army responsible will only result in those abuses continuing and hamper pakistans development into a full democracy
6194892 if this does not work our people will follow him musharraf wherever he goes and whenever they find a chance theyll kill him or get hold of him alive
6194893 for clearing the area of the terrorists if it just so happened that somebody else was there and he was killed he cant be held responsible for murder
6194894 hell play a lot of golf hes very social he knows a lot of people hes a member of all the clubs in karachi
6194895 so i suppose he can have a great time enjoy himself provided nawaz sharif and the lawyers leave him alone

6194959 we saw that sporting events can be fertile ground for illegal alcohol sales and that the seats provide an especially high risk environment at events that every year attract an average of 130 million people
6194960 we know already that theres a link between alcohol use and problem behaviors among fans
6194961 but theres more that sports stadiums can do to prevent sales to people who are clearly drunk if people are intoxicated we dont need them to consume more alcohol
6194962 combining thousands of fans with significant alcohol sales could be construed as a recipe for some serious problems like increased instances of violence and drunk driving
6194963 given the results of this study stadium management and local and state elected officials may want to consider banning or restricting alcohol sales in the stands at sporting events as some stadiums have already done
6194964 however if such a policy is not politically feasible in a particular stadium vendors in the stands may need to receive additional training regarding responsible service of alcohol training that could include how to check age identification and more clearly recognize signs of obvious intoxication
6194965 in addition law enforcement and community groups need to actively monitor and work with stadiums to promote responsible alcohol service at these events

6194968 this morning you announced a new emergency economic plan it includes a 50 billion package can you promise to pay for all that without increasing our debt where will this money come from
6194969 when it comes to a stimulus package typically you are not looking at offsets because what you are trying to do is to prevent the economy from going into a further tailspin
6194970 but with the deficit as high as it is right now is it responsible to propose something that is likely to increase deficit spending
6194971 well michele understand that if we continue on the trends were on right now where unemployment keeps on going up im in florida where they are in recession for the first time in 16 years if you continue to see an economic slide that is going to cost far more in terms of tax revenues because businesses arent selling taxes arent being collected and what were going to end up with is a much worse situation when it comes to our deficit

6195024 i hope you know i am going above and beyond
6195025 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6195026 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6195027 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6195028 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6195029 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6195030 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6195031 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6195032 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6195033 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6195034 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6195035 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6195036 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people

6195039 not talking about the process of the vice presidential situation
6195040 i believe that life applies to those that are not born as well as those that are born
6195041 in the past youve alienated a great deal of conservatives who believe that conservative principles are always the answer by stepping across the aisle
6195042 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can actually rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone who will cause us to want to stay home perhaps
6195043 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats the best that i can tell you

6195049 there is no virtue in that kind of talk and it should always be discouraged my appeal even then was that responsibility is a significant message but our needs require real government intervention and private sector incentives to address the issues such as unemployment building affordable housing and making educa tion even more affordable which really was my point it was a very painful period for me to have gone through that
6195050 hes free to express himself and it does not bother our relationship as father and son at all he was taught to give his opinion in our house hold and he did it in love hes tough hes smart he has a future in politics he didnt want the impression to be that that my faux pas was his faux pas because it is not i respect his right to express himself

6195060 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6195061 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6195062 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6195063 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6195064 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6195065 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6195066 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6195067 how many are worse off than you were since george bush took office that describes the reality of our politics over the last eight years
6195068 and that is the reason i am running for president of the united states of america because i want to make sure that the next generation here in martinsville here in henry county here in virginia here in the united states of america has the jobs and the opportunity of the future
6195069 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he is opposed to new drilling at home and he is opposed to nuclear power
6195070 my friends we have to have nuclear power nuclear power has got to be part of any way of us being energy independent
6195071 the bottom line i think at this stage is too close to call
6195072 we do not know who is going to win but i think we certainly know the myth that obama is going to ascend uncontested to the presidency through adulation and grace and successful oratory is certainly not the case
6195073 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6195074 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6195075 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6195076 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6195077 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6195078 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6195079 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6195080 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6195081 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6195082 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6195083 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
6195084 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
6195085 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
6195086 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6195087 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6195088 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6195089 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6195090 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6195091 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6195092 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6195093 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6195094 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6195095 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6195096 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6195097 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6195098 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6195099 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6195100 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6195101 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6195102 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6195103 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6195104 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6195105 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6195106 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6195107 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6195108 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6195109 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6195110 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6195111 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6195112 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6195113 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6195114 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6195115 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6195116 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6195117 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6195118 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6195119 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6195120 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6195121 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6195122 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6195123 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6195124 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6195125 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6195126 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6195127 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6195128 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6195129 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6195130 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6195131 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6195132 i have a great feeling its a dream come true
6195133 im shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6195134 i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6195135 i worked so hard to become the champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6195136 i ran the corner as hard as possible and once i entered the straight told myself to keep it up dont die on me now
6195137 for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell villain thou knowst no law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
6195138 just so you know were ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
6195139 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6195140 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6195141 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6195142 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
6195143 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6195144 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
6195145 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
6195146 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
6195147 das wrack war total verkohlt und voller leichen da sah nichts mehr wie ein flugzeug aus
6195148 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
6195149 we want to stand by our men in our fight for azadi
6195150 we stamp the ground with anger considering it our enemy india and get satisfaction from doing so
6195151 it gives them pleasure to crush india under their feet
6195152 we tied rakhis to support our men in our fight for restoring the forestland to the amarnath board
6195153 the job of a retirees portfolio is to be sold off piece by piece while also lasting as long as the retiree does
6195154 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
6195155 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
6195156 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6195157 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6195158 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6195159 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6195160 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6195161 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6195162 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6195163 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6195164 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6195165 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6195166 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6195167 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6195168 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6195169 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
6195170 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
6195171 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
6195172 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
6195173 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
6195174 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
6195175 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
6195176 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
6195177 weve got a lot of delegates inspired by the candidate
6195178 many are issue oriented many are generally inspired all carry the same we need change theme
6195179 we had 880 000 democrats vote in the primary thats 280 000 more than before
6195180 goes from college students to senior citizens its a very diverse group some are doing it for the first time
6195181 im fortunate that the first time im going im going to witness history
6195182 we really have a good cross section of people going it says a lot there were a lot of new and young voters in the primary and we dont want to lose them in november we want to keep them engaged
6195183 i think people are ready for change to turn this economy around to end this war
6195184 ketebalan iman adalah pagar betis yang dapat menolak gerakan indomie
6195185 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6195186 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6195187 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6195188 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6195189 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6195190 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6195191 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6195192 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6195193 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6195194 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6195195 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6195196 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6195197 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6195198 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6195199 but she made it very clear shes really not counting on it and she was urging all of her supporters to get beyond the speculation
6195200 it would be such a shocker at this point because so many people have written it off
6195201 im not saying its what he would do but if he has quietly kept her in the mix it would have a powerful effect to kind of come out of the blue
6195202 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6195203 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6195204 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6195205 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6195206 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6195207 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6195208 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6195209 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6195210 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6195211 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6195212 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6195213 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6195214 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6195215 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6195216 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6195217 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6195218 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6195219 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6195220 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6195221 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6195222 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6195223 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6195224 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6195225 citizens are not generally becoming their own journalists replacing news professionals the numbers for that are strikingly limited
6195226 instead already in large numbers people are becoming their own editors checking for news throughout the day hunting through links and aggregators to find what they want sorting among many sources while also looking for overviews of whats new today and sharing what they find with friends
6195227 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
6195228 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
6195229 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
6195230 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
6195231 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
6195232 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
6195233 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
6195234 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
6195235 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
6195236 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
6195237 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
6195238 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
6195239 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6195240 is it doesnt have any real distinct tonality to it its pleasant to listen to its an voice
6195241 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6195242 with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to off shore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama
6195243 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6195244 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6195245 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6195246 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6195247 dah darkies is coming to get yah women yah people of de fox network arise dis is prez mcsame tellin yah all dat de women will be takken by de darkier dats all
6195248 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6195249 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6195250 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6195251 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6195252 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6195253 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6195254 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6195255 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6195256 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6195257 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6195258 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6195259 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6195260 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6195261 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6195262 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6195263 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6195264 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6195265 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6195266 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6195267 im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mudslingers here in washington
6195268 and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mudslingers here in washington
6195269 the repubs dont want him and neither will the democrats
6195270 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6195271 i would just like to take a moment after being seriously sickened by reading about georgia russia and poland and personally thank all the hillary supporters voting for mccain being an ex republican i am absolutely disgusted with the direction this country is going but i have come to the realization that a country like ours is only as good as those people who are willing to be civically responsible so thank you puma and clinton mccain backers for the onslaught on ww iii economic depression and marshall law i realize of course that i am a bit premature in my gratitude but i have every confidence if any ignorant selfish people could pull off completely destroying this country and democracy it will be you hats off to the misguided uniformed and just dont give a darn population putin iran and osama are counting on you
6195272 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6195273 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6195274 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6195275 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6195276 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6195277 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6195278 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6195279 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6195280 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6195281 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6195282 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6195283 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6195284 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6195285 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6195286 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6195287 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6195288 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6195289 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6195290 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6195291 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6195292 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6195293 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6195294 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6195295 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
6195296 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6195297 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
6195298 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
6195299 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
6195300 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
6195301 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
6195302 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
6195303 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
6195304 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
6195305 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
6195306 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
6195307 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
6195308 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6195309 they told me there are going to be resources here
6195310 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6195311 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6195312 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6195313 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6195314 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6195315 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6195316 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6195317 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6195318 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6195319 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6195320 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6195321 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians
6195322 it suddenly starts being several hundred dollars worth of interest charges
6195323 as issuers have discovered the small business segment they have become fairly aggressive about getting small business cards into the hands of some very early stage businesses

6195325 the russian defence ministry had telephoned the norwegian embassy in moscow
6195326 we are in ohio in a significant way with a full operational staff with offices all across the state
6195327 weve been running television ads now for i believe seven weeks we view ohio as a very important part of our puzzle to get enough electoral votes to win the presidency for barack
6195328 there is no question that ohios electoral votes are critical to that victory
6195329 its always a major battleground state its really no different this year
6195330 ive been engaged in a lot of presidential campaigns during my life i have never seen a presidential campaign in ohio come anywhere close to where this campaign is organizationally and in terms of having actual man and woman power in the field
6195331 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists
6195332 with all due respect and i know the other folks in consideration theyre a wonderful group but theyre not really all that close
6195333 you guys have better things to do im not the guy
6195334 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6195335 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6195336 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6195337 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6195338 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6195339 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6195340 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6195341 banks may want to consider do we want to encourage them to deposit checks at all
6195342 the bank has an even higher burden around fraud detection
6195343 it would be incorrect to say that there is no potential for fraud our responsibility and i think we meet that is to be sure that we stay abreast of the security protocols and the security activities that will make the transactions as secure as absolutely possible
6195344 the fact is society is changing and now financial institutions want to make that change
6195345 i think it would be a foolish mistake to bypass this opportunity
6195346 checks at the corporate level are going to be around for years and years and years

6195364 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
6195365 the announcement yesterday that phelps 23 winner of a record eight gold medals at the beijing olympics would grace frosted flakes and corn flakes boxes instead of the traditional athletes choice of wheaties left many perplexed
6195366 frosted flakes has three times the amount of sugar as wheaties and 1 3rd the fiber

6195394 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6195395 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6195396 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6195397 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january

6195406 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6195407 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6195408 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6195409 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6195410 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6195411 professional sports stadiums are another place where theres a great likelihood of illegal alcohol sales
6195412 we know that we have problems with fans drinking too much and contributing to problems in and around stadiums we need to make sure we prevent these illegal sales from occurring
6195413 i would imagine these vendors are under quite a bit of pressure trying to not block the views of others trying to pay attention
6195414 they dont have the time or proximity to buyers to make observations necessary to avoid making an illegal sale
6195415 everything always changes the best plan lasts until the first arrow leaves the bow
6195416 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

6195418 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6195419 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6195420 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6195421 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate

6195426 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

6195431 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6195432 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6195433 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6195434 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6195435 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6195436 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6195437 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6195438 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6195439 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6195440 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6195441 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6195442 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt

6195451 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6195452 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6195453 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6195454 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6195455 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6195456 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6195457 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6195458 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6195459 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6195460 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6195461 in the next few days we will know if russia wants to be part of the international community or if they dont give a damn what the worlds thinks of them
6195462 theyre all on holiday weve had some discussions with the european commission but were waiting for people to come back from their vacation throughout this crisis the european parliament has been on vacation
6195463 although the french have made some initiatives i havent noticed any response from the european union as a body the european parliament hasnt made any decisions yet the commission in their first meeting tried to postpone a decision until september i can tell you the position of individual countries but the position of the european union is unknown at this time were having better luck with nato
6195464 they have no experience they tried and failed completely in yugoslavia
6195465 i dont know whats going to happen this evening will the russians withdraw will they attack nobody knows
6195466 sos georgia was mainly set up for humanitarian aid but if things get worse some people may decide to go and fight on the ground this would be their own decision and nothing to do with the organisation
6195467 it was russian soldiers who invaded russian aircraft that did the bombing
6195468 if the russians dont co operate with the rest of the world behaving as they did after the cold war then were entering another era one in which russia does whatever it wants
6195469 russia must withdraw not completely but to show goodwill they must return to where they were before the conflict

6195483 helping build a community of entrepreneurs by giving them the tools support and solutions they require in order to build successful companies is extremely important for building sustainable communities
6195484 on the african continent there are more versions of business centers than there are countries for example angola has at least two one is a library of relevant training and reference materials backed by a staff of counselors to accommodate walk in clients and another restricts itself to industries related to oil production and export in order to help build a specific economic sector
6195485 in egypt four deal with microbusiness and another two with larger ventures
6195486 write a business plan that addresses the usual issues of marketing competition finance and governance
6195487 the rules governing for and nonprofit or nongovernmental sector legal and organizational issues vary significantly from country to country as do the methods for setting them up and the time needed to do so many countries do not have clear legal definitions of nonprofit or nongovernmental entities or require excessive time and effort to create them
6195488 at the moment there is a favorable climate for entrepreneurship but even those with good ideas dont have access to capital
6195489 convene a meeting of business groups and have a clear conversation about your vision and dream then ask them how they can be part of this center which would be breaking new ground

6195496 message wise its a great opportunity that fits completely with where he is as a leader and what hes offering as a candidate
6195497 weve got to get beyond the notion that every problem has got either a democrat or republican solution
6195498 when in actuality we need to put american solutions first and the notion that you cant write off all of small town and rural america which both political parties have for 30 years
6195499 if i were in his shoes id be self deprecating to obama both as the nominee and the guy who did this four years ago

6195545 there was some implication that i was creating controversy and had too much influence on the board
6195546 the university felt they should have more say in how things are resolved and they used their influence to get what they wanted

6195576 we lost one starter but that doesnt mean well have the same look as we did last year
6195577 its a new year with new possibilities weve increased our depth this year we feel that our returners have a much better understanding of how we go about doing our business which is going to make things a lot more helpful and a lot easier for all the newcomers to adapt we know people will be fired up to play us but were ready for the challenge
6195578 i think defensively were going to be very solid like we were last year and i think were going to be more dangerous offensively than last year its about experience and understanding the way we want them to play
6195579 we just need to be smarter our level of intelligence last year was not very high our goal this year is to be just as organized just as hard but more intelligent
6195580 were looking to improve every game the only thing we have control over is what we do
6195581 olsen has the potential to be one of the best goalkeepers if not in the country but internationally as well her strengths are her athleticism and her hands the area shes improved on the most is her organization and her leadership
6195582 brittany has done a lot of work to improve herself right now theyre competing for that starting position
6195583 i think defensively we are deeper than weve ever been back there with the additions of five new players and holmes competing for a position in the back
6195584 obviously currier is the leader of the back four and were hopeful that shell have the same type of year she had for us last year
6195585 strong is another senior for us who we expect to make an impact back there johnsons recovering from injury and we hope to get her back massey is an all around defender who can see time middle or outside and karter will do exactly what she did last year shes solid and hardworking
6195586 finch will be doing multiple roles for us again her experience in the back and in the midfield makes her a key player in the things we do her intelligence and leadership are going to be greatly needed
6195587 were hopeful that shell find her fitness in the first segment of the season shes one of the best attacking backs in the country
6195588 our midfield is extremely dynamic and they will be showing us a lot of new things this season
6195589 ashley nick is our captain and leader and an all around great human being
6195590 jamie seems to be on the way back from her injuries and were hopeful for her to have an impact as well d vila has really improved her game she worked very hard in the offseason to get herself stronger expect her to score more goals for us than last year
6195591 we have great experience and great youth and talent thats going to allow us to improve our possession game
6195592 kerridge with all her national team experience this last year could be a possible starter as a freshmen carly butcher once she adjusts to the level of competition at training every day we expect her to have an impact both are very technical players chelsea with her pace and natural left foot were hopeful shell also be able to contribute as a freshman
6195593 obviously with amy and all the national team experience that shes gained were expecting her to have an even better year than last year
6195594 megan is much fitter than she was last year and her understanding of our play in the final third has improved tremendously expect her to have more goals as well as assists this year
6195595 and oh by the way ashley freyer is going to cause havoc for the opposition this year
6195596 its the coliseum the home of two olympic games the dodgers rams raiders and the home of our football program its a chance to be a part of the history
6195597 we have to be as smart as we can be this year
6195598 we need to keep the focus on ourselves and how much we improve every day
6195599 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
6195600 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
6195601 omg if im just a pack of neurons i have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this experiment

6195609 the functionality of a signing statement is greatly reduced if it is too vague to identify the concerns of the president and the interpretation of the law that the president is trying to convey to the executive branch
6195610 while presidents have issued signing statements for quite some time this president has issued a significantly larger percentage of signing statements challenging or objecting to various provisions of the law
6195611 signing statements may if used appropriately serve a legitimate function as a tool for continuing dialog between the president congress and the public on the other hand signing statements may be a mechanism to expand executive authority at the expense of the legislature

6195614 after more than five years of requests we have only recently received access to redacted versions of olc legal opinions related to the cias interrogation program

6195641 how horrible a terrorist attack is but to me the terrorists win if we give up what makes this country what it is
6195642 we wanted to protect patrons privacy because these letters came with no court order if they were using the letters to pursue terrorists why were they afraid to go to a court to get an order and we wanted people to know that this sort of spying was going on
6195643 we thought civil liberties had been restored but there is no way to win if you do contest the letters

6195661 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6195662 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6195663 we take full responsibility and accept the penalties nascar has levied against us today
6195664 we are however disappointed that nascar chose to place our drivers on probation as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6195665 they attempted to cheat in the next two seasons by doing what they did in that dyno test
6195666 its worse than cheating in that one race they attempted to cheat for the next whatever session that was going to be before the next dyno session before nascar could prove it
6195667 i almost wish they were just cheating in that one race because i would have felt better about it but what they attempted to do was cheat us for the rest of the season all the way up to probably atlanta of next year before another dyno test was done thats what makes it even worse
6195668 i have received intimation from the gretna fc administrator of their resignation from the scottish football league with immediate effect

6195687 the enemy of a good plan is the search for a perfect plan
6195688 if i make the effort to understand and implement this strategy how much of a difference could it realistically make in the end vs
6195689 the less time you spend trying to learn everything there is to know about stocks bonds and mutual funds the better off you are
6195690 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street creation the faster and farther investors should run
6195691 if you work too hard at investing and youre too active in the financial markets youll probably lose your shirt
6195692 a couple of u s stock funds or even just one a total stock market index fund plus a foreign stock fund and a bond fund are all most people need to cover the bases
6195693 although its impossible to prove that a complex approach is unproductive academic research and investor behavior suggest that complexity preys on tendencies that can do a lot of damage to our portfolios
6195694 all of us would be better investors if we just made fewer decisions
6195695 to invest successfully you need not understand beta efficient markets modern portfolio theory option pricing or emerging markets you may in fact be better off knnowing nothing of these
6195696 the key to whatever success i may have enjoyed during my long investment career is that the lord gave me enough common sense to recognize the majesty of simplicity
6195697 serve as a wakeup call to police departments across the country the lesson is simple in the united states of america you dont arrest people simply because they assemble to protest government policy
6195698 police immediately cordoned off the street and allowed no one to enter or leave then without any announcement they started arresting all the protesters on trumped up charges
6195699 perhaps the finest hour in the history of the new york city department
6195700 you have to wonder what the new york city police department is trying to hide
6195701 along with mayor michael bloombergs denial of permits for protests on central parks great lawn the police action helped to all but eliminate dissent from new york city during the republican delegates visit if that was the goal then mission accomplished and civil rights denied
6195702 sent helicopters to track the riders as they roll through manhattan on the last friday evening of every month they have stationed mobile command centers the kind of trailer size outposts set up after a major emergency near where the cyclists usually gather in union square

6195710 hes a big powerful lad that can play in the middle of the park hes got good feet is a good passer of the ball and has a presence about him
6195711 he has not contacted me or my representatives or replied to any letters we have sent
6195712 i can only assume that he is in serious difficulty
6195713 he has put 8m into this company and it appears to be almost lost
6195714 but he has not come forward and had not contacted me there is no rescue package from mr mileson
6195715 we cant do a cvl creditors voluntary liquidation because the company would go back to mr mileson
6195716 the spl will allow me to transfer gretna into a new company to avoid that
6195717 but we and the sfl had to make sure we protected the integrity of our league
6195718 i have sympathy with the people at gretna the players the staff and the fans but the sfl gave them as long as they could
6195719 somebody up there likes us we havent had much luck recently so im delighted
6195720 our long term aim was always to get in to the sfl but we are not counting any chickens
6195721 we have a new 500 seater stand and concrete terracing right round the ground
6195722 the only stumbling block might be the floodlights but we had planned do see to them this calendar year
6195723 companies have begun to moderate their targeted pay levels bringing them more in line with those of their peers
6195724 companies have begun to moderate their targeted executive pay levels and have brought them more in line with those of their peers
6195725 shareholders are often critical of executive pay packages and companies are listening to their concerns by proactively developing more shareholder friendly pay practices
6195726 while not all companies have yet to follow suit both shareholders and the securities and exchange commission can be pleased with the trend
6195727 because there are no funds at the moment to carry on everybody has been made redundant
6195728 we assume for most of us its the end of the line at gretna
6195729 he confirmed that he is still in negotiations with the scottish football league with a view to obtaining entry into the first division
6195730 its a shock to the players that have got contracts not only for the rest of the season but for next season
6195731 and its a shock im sure to the local people for whom the club is very very important
6195732 the board answered that challenge at least at the first stage
6195733 david garland is kind of the embodiment of baylor 2012 the paradigm of what were looking for
6195734 he communicates the gospel very effectively and will represent baylor wonderfully
6195735 no matter what part of the baylor family you look at he has been affirmed as a teacher administrator and researcher
6195736 and he has hired as fine a faculty as truett ever has had
6195737 i had to be open to what god has for me right now
6195738 if you preach about giving your life in service you have to be willing to serve
6195739 baylor is well run now it is an outstanding institution with outstanding administrators
6195740 i want to sit down with various people on campus
6195741 i want to listen to them and see if we can bring about a clear sense of unity there already is more unity on campus than one would think from reading various press releases
6195742 the alumni of baylor university are incredibly devoted to baylor university
6195743 we absolutely need their support and they should be proud of what has happened at baylor university
6195744 dr garland has many years of experience as a faculty member both as a dedicated teacher and a respected scholar
6195745 these faculty credentials combined with his experience as an academic administrator make him an excellent choice for this appointment
6195746 i have every confidence david garland will do an excellent job as interim president
6195747 at one level he embodies the very best of baylors tradition of the scholar teacher at another level david understands fully baylors unique challenge to be the top protestant research university in the country i know those who care about baylor will rally to his support
6195748 it is encouraging that we have such a fine person in david garland to serve in this role said jeff kilgore executive vice president and ceo of the baylor alumni association
6195749 as he has done at truett i think david should do a fine job continuing to build consensus through a process of inclusion on campus i look forward to working with him and hope that this appointment is indicative of whats more to come for the baylor family

6195753 by degrees it was seen that even the lords people could not carry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome practice
6195754 jennifer is so intent on getting married and having children he felt hemmed in
6195755 a small business needs to be so conscious of cash flow
6195756 to keep more of the profits for us thats just a good way to be
6195757 at the end of the day we did this for financial reasons
6195758 there were several other clubs interested in signing gavin but he got back to me saying hed like to join us
6195759 i had one offer on the table which i decided at that late stage i would pursue
6195760 the prospective purchaser had produced a business plan based on first division football and so he has formally withdrawn his offer
6195761 effectively we are still technically in the third division but i cant complete fixtures next season
6195762 then a few years ago mr mileson took over and injected a lot of money into the club and it enjoyed a lot of success on the football pitch
6195763 but if you take away the benefactor the person supplying the money then financially you have a real mess
6195764 theres a lot of young talent but some experience and knowledge is needed
6195765 im looking to prove what i can do for paul simpson
6195766 and i feel i can break into the first team
6195767 in carefully calibrated public statements and blunter private acknowledgments about the limits of american leverage over general musharraf the officials argued that it would be counterproductive to let pakistans political turmoil interfere with their best hope of ousting central leadership and the taliban from the countrys mountainous tribal areas

6195771 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down li said
6195772 it shows the dream of chinese sportsmen for generations and also the common aspirations of 1 3 billion chinese people
6195773 otaku the nickname given to the chinese couch potatoes glued to olympic tv coverage
6195774 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr
6195775 and were seeing people crowd around big screen tvs to watch the events theyre more interested in sports than in cultural programs
6195776 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up
6195777 with the sports infrastructure the facilities the coaches who are being developed here and the young people who will be inspired by these games we think this will be a formidable system that well have to contend with for a very very long time said jim scherr head of the u
6195778 in shooting we call it the home venue curse said wang yifu coach of chinas shooting team
6195779 mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles
6195780 there is so much psychological pressure on them that i thought more athletes might collapse she said
6195781 i have a responsibility to fight for my country i was fighting for chinas glory
6195782 the board of directors has been pleased with the commitment of diamond hill capital management inc the funds advisor and although the financial sector has seen turmoil in recent months we believe that the advisors long term approach positions the fund well for any recovery in the financial sector
6195783 as a result of the market down turn the funds unrealized gains virtually have been eliminated which may have the effect of reducing the potential tax liability to shareholders
6195784 the current market conditions have provided many buying opportunities of companies that we believe are trading below our estimate of their intrinsic value we remain optimistic regarding the long term investment outlook for financial stocks
6195785 ich glaube nicht dass dies ein neuer kalter krieg ist
6195786 es ist eine schwierige zeit aber wir sollten die schwierigkeiten nicht berbewerten
6195787 ich denke russland sollte wirklich ber gegenschritte nachdenken um gegen seine umzingelung vorzugehen
6195788 increase with age with an overall prevalence of greater than 50 in men 50 years or older
6195789 drogba will not be back before a month a month and a half
6195790 he has started to run but he will not be available for the match against qualifier september 5
6195791 hes getting better and is working with a fitness coach back at the
6195792 the janet amp walter sondheim prize finalists artscape at the bma
6195793 this is not only a heinous act but tantamount to selling the countrys sovereignty and independence to another nation it is shameful utterly humiliating to every pakistani
6195794 it is high time that the present government act like an independent sovereign nation and form its own foreign policy leaving behind the legacy of a discredited military dictator
6195795 based on the testimony of detainees held in bagram in 2003 and 2004 it is clear that there was a woman being held at the base whether or not that woman was aafia siddiqi is something that at the moment cannot be verified
6195796 however dr siddiqi has confirmed that she was held in bagram for years
6195797 i fear for her life they probably dont want her to see the light of day said fouzia if they release her the truth will come out
6195798 a close look at the picture in newspapers here shows the years of torture dark circles under her eyes a broken and badly fixed nose made up teeth and crumbled lips it is a picture of a severely dehydrated and unwell person almost as if on the deathbed it shows the inhumane brutality of a civilised nation by the administration of the country which claims to be civilised
6195799 she was suffering from multiple bullet wounds that had been not been attended to she came to court in a wheelchair and was suffering from intense abdominal pain for which she was given aspirin which could only act as poison for her ulcerous condition
6195800 my brother told me he saw the perpetrators and the victim together in one room there was not a shred of compassion just stony eyed hate
6195801 you know it would have been better if she had died i believed she had died and was reconciled to the idea that way i could move on and then she re surfaced like resurrected from the dead and that brought some hope but seeing her like this it just breaks my heart
6195802 after seeing aafias pictures splashed in newspapers across the country and the torture marks she bore for five years i fear for my husbands life too janjua said but being a woman and a mother whose children have been separated from her i can feel the torment shes going through
6195803 to say that she aafia had been taken into custody only on jul 17 2008 is a blatant lie as transparently ugly as any falsehood can be the insinuation that she had been hiding herself since 2003 is a travesty of truth an affront to peoples commonsense
6195804 we consider dr aafias case an instance of utterly unconscionable and most brutal form of attack on a human beings individual rights
6195805 the hrcp had been calling for her recovery since 2003 and when it went to the supreme court in 2007 her name was high on the list the only mystery was the silence of aafias family
6195806 all these years we were told by various government people that she was alright and is well and not to probe too much or harm would come to her
6195807 u s military and civilian personnel are credibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees
6195808 in every state governed by rule of law a victim of governmental abuse should have a remedy to bring a claim of reparation against the government thats a basic requirement of the rule of law
6195809 the rasul case was brought to establish a principle of accountability
6195810 we know that theres been an enormous amount of abuse its systemic not just a few rotten applies at abu ghraib but no one of any importance has ever been held accountable
6195811 these legal doctrines of immunity have no place where theres a clear military prohibition on this kind of conduct
6195812 mistreatment of prisoners is forbidden by the uniform code of military justice and its been outlawed going all the way back to george washington after the battle of trenton when he forbid the mistreatment of prussian mercenaries
6195813 intentional infliction of any suffering or disgrace by cruel imprisonment want of food by mutilation death or any other barbarity
6195814 violence to life and person mutilation cruel treatment and torture and outrages upon personal dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment
6195815 a court may be more comfortable protecting someones interests to be free from unlawful imprisonment yet more reluctant to hold government officials liable
6195816 the most frustrating situation is where victims dont even get their day in court
6195817 claim of privilege a mysterious plane crash a landmark supreme court case and the rise of state secrets
6195818 victims of violations of common article 3 must have some remedy that compensates them and deters future violations
6195819 these people are having trouble moving ahead with their lives
6195820 if the government officials that were involved in drafting the torture memos that played a role in the policies in abu ghraib and elsewhere were not very cautious about their foreign travel
6195821 i cant imagine that john yoo for example would not be thinking about that and consulting with his own counsel before he travels anywhere
6195822 if they just want to take their chances in lunchtime traffic then they dont need a permit but then that means that the breasts and all the nudity will have to compete for attention with say the number three bus to lyall bay
6195823 so etwas habe ich in meinem leben noch nie gesehen
6195824 relations with the vatican are constantly improving we can say that there are big developments
6195825 individuals and businesses alike are looking for cost savings in every decision they make residents are looking for easy commutes to job centers such as manhattan from places that offer low cost high quality housing businesses are looking for savings anywhere they can find it
6195826 then it was just a matter of getting police there
6195827 collaborates with a variety of institutions charitable governmental religious educational medical corporate to establish philanthropic and humanitarian service projects
6195828 this tournament will give our scholar athletes and future leaders their first opportunity to shine playing before their friends family and neighbors
6195829 it will also help them achieve their educational goals define their dreams and manifest their own personal excellence in the future
6195830 we are happy because the physical condition of the players is not top because the english league started only two weeks ago and the norway league is already 16 games old
6195831 i wanted to see our team with new players in a very difficult place i know norway teams i know sweden and we said yesterday the game would be a good test because the mentality in the second half we saw norway put us under pressure
6195832 we have proposed to sanzar that a bye be included when new zealand tour south africa next year
6195833 we the springboks will then play the all blacks twice and the wallabies once just after the tour by the british and irish lions
6195834 when they come here the time difference favours them they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there
6195835 then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays
6195836 sanzar consists of three countries and the profits and losses should be shared
6195837 from a business point of view it was too expensive to include a bye
6195838 during the first extended tri nations series in 2006 the springboks spent an additional week in sydney but it means the tour is then extended to five weeks
6195839 it always will be regardless of the state of the economy after all the key to long term growth and productivity is a workforce thats familiar with your company and in sync with your business goals your workplace should excite and motivate your employees so theyll want to stay around and that means creating an environment that challenges people and helps them grow not just as employees but as people
6195840 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
6195841 have you ever wondered if your mechanic is charging you a fair price for your auto repair
6195842 last night the eye actually skirted st lucie county we were on the southside of the eye
6195843 it actually became stationary last night at one point and thats the reason why we have so much water today we thought wed get maybe 4 or 5 inches of rain with this weather and we got closer to 15
6195844 they sent a warning to everyone not to leave their homes because the snakes are coming out of their holes and theres fish everywhere
6195845 they might meet with a client to work out with them but then they also can advise them on days that they dont meet with them accountability has a large role to play in a successful client trainer relationship the client knows that the trainer has access to their training log online so theres that accountability if i dont log in for three days i might get a call from my trainer saying hey hows it going
6195846 we have a very large database which includes the usda database a packaged foods database and a community generated database so if i cant find what i ate today in the other trainingpeaks databases i can actually enter in a custom food and then share that out to the community then other people can search and they might find something that i entered in yesterday and then pull that into their favorites list so its an ever growing database which is really nice
6195847 a lot of it comes down to your business model and what services you are offering when you start to think about the model of bringing on new assistants you can really leverage the system we have one coach who started out with ten clients and now he has 400 but hes got 17 assistants under him and he manages group training so hes really leveraged the system to expand his overall business model
6195848 as a result when we laser cut parts we knew that they would all fit when we put them together because wed already analyzed the motion of the assembly autodesk productstream further increased our productivity by serving as the pipeline between different workgroups in our digital prototyping workflow allowing us to easily manage our design data and readily handle engineering change orders and version control
6195849 digital prototyping has helped wipaire meet the demand for innovative new firefighting tools by evolving its product in less time and with less costs
6195850 their innovation is responsible for enhancing public safety and helping to protect natural environments across the globe it is a pleasure to name wipaire as our inventor of the month for august
6195851 we were trying to create a new york type vibe to have the people walk into the streets
6195852 the slew of people who come into the gateway who never come out we want to encourage people to leave their offices
6195853 although it is understandable that dcca in good faith would like to comply with the hcr 358 hd1 in seeking alternate methods to procurement law it is not a position supported by spo and is not a justifiable reason for the extension of the exemption
6195854 this latest ruling proves that advocates of same sex marriage are not simply seeking tolerance but rather are pushing for compliance in every corner of california society
6195855 they will stop at nothing to chip away at the free speech rights and the rights of conscience of californians everywhere forcing individuals to accept their lifestyle even against a persons personal or religious beliefs it is a slippery slope against the individual rights of californians
6195856 in todays highly connected world intel takes mobile device security very seriously
6195857 intels low power technologies in combination with mcafees experience in security solutions should enable a more robust and secure solution for our customers
6195858 mcafee provides enterprise class powerful encryption and strong access control technologies that seamlessly integrate with existing systems
6195859 by teaming with intel to provide encryption for laptops we are extending protection to customers anywhere anytime
6195860 grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is
6195861 we are very pleased with our performance in this challenging economic environment our disciplined management of inventory and expenses resulted in earnings per share that exceeded our initial expectations and increased 35 over last years comparable result in spite of negative same store sales in the quarter although we expect that the environment will continue to remain challenging we will continue to conservatively manage the financial aspects of the business while at the same time provide compelling assortments and exciting store experiences to build our brands
6195862 we had to close it out early because of the high demand
6195863 even if we turn frisbee back to the town that process will take two to three years and these improvements would have already paid for themselves
6195864 we didnt get the full reimbursement on the school lighting and now we have this wells ogunquit thing
6195865 obviously it is frustrating when guns injure or kill people but when a young person is hurt it is a deeper blow
6195866 we are making strides but at times your success is punctuated by incidents like this that show how much more work there is to be done
6195867 its obviously senseless but the fact of the matter is that virtually all these cases are senseless
6195868 were very pleased that ni has recognized our success in developing a medical device used to treat breast tumors in a less invasive and nearly painless procedure while maintaining the design process within strict regulatory guidelines
6195869 receiving industry recognition of this caliber is a nice complement to the positive feedback weve been getting from physicians and their patients who have undergone treatment with the visica system nationwide there has been no reported fibroadenoma re growth in more than 2 000 procedures
6195870 thanks to ni we quickly and efficiently developed an embedded control system with a user friendly gui for the visica 2 system while maintaining the highest quality and ultimately ensuring the safety of our customers patients
6195871 ni played a fundamental part in achieving our goals under extreme time to market pressure to deliver a device that would dramatically reduce the emotional and physical discomfort of patients undergoing tumor treatment our product design prototype and eventual deployment timelines were met because of the graphical system design platform from ni
6195872 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
6195873 intervales investment in tejas will enable us to grow our core business and expand our product lines as an innovative completions solutions company

6195881 though we do not admit liability we chose to settle this case because we are and have been firmly committed to the well being of our residents
6195882 litigation is a long expensive process that would take our focus away from where it belongs on our residents
6195883 the purpose of a class action suit is to make positive change
6195884 we appreciate that sun mar is stepping up to the plate and taking action to ensure its compliance with such important regulations as maintaining minimum staffing
6195885 this settlement demonstrates how the civil justice system can benefit everybody
6195886 the elder and infirm adults and their families at sun mars 18 facilities can hopefully now be assured of quality care and sun mar has the opportunity to improve the level of quality care it offers its residents should they not the auditor will act vigilantly
6195887 currently 1 253 home and business disaster loans have been approved in the amount of 60 455 300 for affected victims

6195889 have you ever wondered if your mechanic is charging you a fair price for your auto repair
6195890 a mechanic provides a specialized service in the local community like a doctor or dentist and people should have better information to vet their repair needs and expenses
6195891 our goal is to be the most trusted broker of auto repair information in doing so we can protect car owners from getting ripped off and grant them peace of mind
6195892 have you ever wondered if your mechanic is charging you a fair price for your auto repair

6195899 we have been assuming that the ways in which emotions are organized in the brain are essentially similar in men and women
6195900 im kind of hurt that you forgot i hate sushi
6195901 excel in being able to come up with appropriate words given cues
6195902 we havent seen those prices reflected in the finished products yet
6195903 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
6195904 absolutely convinced that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue
6195905 to the extent that the economy gets worse that will help sen
6195906 people are overwhelmingly saying that the economy is what matters this election
6195907 you look at poll numbers and mccain is hanging tough under very difficult economic circumstances
6195908 mccains strong case for more domestic oil drilling is something americans want to hear if he can make a compelling case that he is going to keep taxes low and change policies to improve the domestic production of oil he can overcome the idea that republicans are to blame for a bad economy
6195909 if banks fail if the housing crisis gets worse its conventional wisdom that that would be helpful to obama republicans will be blamed for any disruption in the economy rightfully or wrongfully
6195910 the trend is set now people understand the economy has been weak under bush at least in his second term so that certainly hurts sen mccain as the republican nominee and gives sen obama a significant edge because he can argue that we cant continue this path
6195911 i think gas prices will trend down to election day and beyond and that will be a positive in the psychology of voters but its not going to outweigh the negatives of the job market
6195912 i dont think the average person feels the worst is over by any stretch of the imagination
6195913 its been a long time since one of these had an accident
6195914 they are a little thirsty by standards of other planes but they have a very strong safety record
6195915 the fatal hull loss accident rate for md 80s is 0 34 per million departures

6195923 antics contract will be renewed automatically if we qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa we are very optimistic about our chances
6195924 it may be the beginning of a trend but it may also be a bad sign
6195925 a few years ago they were trialing rfid technology with a few hundred objects being tracked
6195926 you can see where people are and figure out how theyre spending their time
6195927 today they are much more open to multiple technology investments to get increased levels of location accuracy

6195939 edgy and intensely heated this cowboy story is especially good alison kent never fails to deliver
6195940 writings not rocket science its a helluva lot harder because once you learn all that rocket science crap you can at least in theory build a rocket on the other hand you can read every writing book known to man and attend classes and work with critique partners and get pages of editorial input and still end up with a book that doesnt quite hit the high notes scary but true
6195941 can i be blunt on this subject if you dont have time to read you dont have the time or the tools to write simple as that reading is the creative center of a writers life
6195942 you know im a storyteller we are storytellers and ours is an ancient tradition contemporized by the cinema and the capturing of light and we should all be very proud of our place in society on any given night millions of people across the world buy a ticket for adventures that only we as storytellers can provide we release burdens we galvanize emotions we make people laugh we make people talk over breakfast this is a great job and i want to encourage every one of you in this room to give everything you can to the story god bless narrative god bless originality
6195943 when i write i feel like an armless legless man with a crayon in his mouth
6195944 dont be afraid of your material or your past be afraid of wasting any more time obsessing about how you look and how people see you be afraid of not getting your writing done
6195945 my new years resolution is to focus on the book and forget all the crap that surrounds the writing business to lose myself in a story and not give a damn if it makes any lists has a good sell through gets glowing reviews on amazon pleases my editors hell even pleases my readers i want to love what im writing so much that none of the rest of it matters and if i dont i wont write it lifes too short to abuse the muse
6195946 america is now wholly given over to a d d mob of scribbling women and i should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash and should be ashamed of myself if i did succeed what is the mystery of these innumberable editions of the lamplighter by maria susanna cummins and other books neither better nor worse worse they could not be and better they need not be when they sell by the hundred thousand
6195947 as for my next book i am going to hold myself from writing it till i have it impending in me grown heavy in my mind like a ripe pear pendant gravid asking to be cut or it will fall
6195948 the storyteller is deep inside everyone of us the story maker is always with us let us suppose our world is attacked by war by the horrors that we all of us easily imagine let us suppose floods wash through our cities the seas rise but the storyteller will be there for it is our imaginations which shape us keep us create us for good and for ill it is our stories that will recreate us when we are torn hurt even destroyed it is the storyteller the dream maker the myth maker that is our phoenix that represents us at our best and at our most creative

6195954 we are pleased to report that our revenue in the second quarter was within our stated guidance gross margin in the second quarter of 2008 declined as compared to the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower capacity utilization in memory final testing and price erosion of dram business flash revenues declined 7 quarter over quarter and contributed to around 29 of our total revenue in q2 down from 32 in the previous quarter in a more positive light among our flash sector mask rom revenues were up 10 quarter over quarter and contributed to 7 of flash revenue mixed signal revenues were also up 11 quarter over quarter and contributed to 8 of our total revenue revenues from our lcd driver ic increased 3 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2008 reflecting a brief recovery in demand from our customers dram revenues remained relatively flat up 1 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous quarter
6195955 our capex in the second quarter was us 15 2 million which was down from us 26 2 million in the first quarter of 2008 in july we received the final approval from shanghai government to cut down our capital investment obligation before end of this year to us 130 million we have completed our obligation by investing the remaining us 7 5 million of investment commitment in early august combining our cash position and undrawn credit lines provided by banks we have more than sufficient financial resources to face the debt due in 2008 there is no urgent need for company to raise additional fund in any form from the market
6195956 the overall dram market visibility in following quarters remains limited we do not anticipate the recovery of our dram business due to weaker than expected pc demand we remain cautious on the lcd market due to weak seasonal demand however we still notice better demands from our customers in q4 as compared to q3 in addition gold bumping business will maintain its growth momentum in the second half due to new customer programs mask rom and mixed signal revenues should continue to grow with the increase in demands from customers considering the overall market situation among our product segments we currently expect that q3 revenue to be in the range of approximately us 149 million to us 159 million which is down 6 to flat as compared to q2 and gross margin to be in the range of 2 5 to 5 5 in the current down cycle we are strongly confident in our ability to maintain healthy operations and we plan to continue our disciplined capital expenditures and to strictly focus on cost savings and customer expansion

6196175 this is probably the toughest i have ever seen it this business is based on disposable income people who might have come in five years ago and spent 300 will come in now and spend 150 they are very careful about what they buy and how much they spend

6196192 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6196193 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6196194 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6196195 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6196196 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6196197 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6196198 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6196199 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6196200 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6196201 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6196202 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6196203 auch wenn diese vorg nge zeitlich nur einen geringen anteil ausmachen am gesamten flug
6196204 grunds tzlich sind beim start zwei geschwindigkeiten zu unterscheiden v1 die sogenannte entscheidungsgeschwindigkeit und v2 die abhebegeschwindigkeit
6196205 ist das flugzeug aber schneller muss der start trotz allem weitergef hrt werden weil f r eine bremsung nicht gen gend platz mehr da ist auf der piste
6196206 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6196207 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6196208 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6196209 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6196210 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6196211 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6196212 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6196213 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6196214 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6196215 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6196216 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6196217 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6196218 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6196219 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6196220 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6196221 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6196222 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6196223 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6196224 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6196225 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6196226 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6196233 it seems that small caps are just better off in that environment
6196234 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6196235 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6196236 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6196238 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6196239 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6196299 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6196300 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6196301 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6196302 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6196303 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6196304 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6196305 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6196306 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6196307 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6196308 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6196309 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6196310 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6196311 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6196312 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6196313 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6196315 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6196316 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6196317 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6196318 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6196319 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6196320 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6196321 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6196322 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6196323 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

6196332 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6196333 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6196334 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6196335 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6196336 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6196337 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer

6196339 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6196340 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6196341 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6196342 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6196343 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6196344 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6196345 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6196346 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6196347 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6196348 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6196349 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6196350 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6196351 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6196363 wir haben wirklich eine deutsche sportlerin bei den olympischen spielen die geht
6196364 wer gehen mal ausprobiert hat wei dass man die technik nicht auf anhieb beherrscht und dass es auch gar nicht so einfach oder komisch ist wie es vielleicht aussieht
6196365 ich habe mich so gefreut an dem tag gab es auch keine medaillen f r deutsche sportler das war mein gl ck und so durfte ich als f nfte sogar zu beckmanns olympia nacht die medien haben so positiv berichtet weil ich mich so gefreut habe eine almsick h tte man wegen eines f nften platzes verh hnt
6196366 wenn der sportler zeigt wie viel die eigene leistung wert ist wissen die medien das auch wertzusch tzen und wenn die dann mitspielen und dich pushen dann h tten die leute viel mehr ahnung und w rden auch den sport fter gucken die medien haben es in der hand

6196375 although it saddens me to leave the chapter a change of course in my professional career has made this difficult decision necessary however without question i leave the chapter in extremely capable hands with ann storberg as its new president supported by a highly talented board of directors ann has demonstrated exceptional leadership since joining the virtual chapter s board three years ago serving as the programs committee chair and chapter treasurer i have greatly enjoyed my half decade of service to the virtual chapter and remain available to contribute to its future success when and where appropriate
6196376 we appreciate all the years of service lenny has provided the niri virtual chapter playing an important role in making it the success it is today
6196377 while we re disappointed to see him leave i am personally very excited to take on the challenge of chapter president and look forward to showcasing all the programs and professional development initiatives we have planned for the 2008 2009 year including the expansion of the virtual ally program as well as the virtual chapter s online community in doing so we expect to further the growth of the chapter and provide our members with more resources to better their development than ever before

6196381 i hope that all committee members will be able to support the civic reception and that t hose who feel they are unable to vote for will at least not vote against the worst thing for the city will be if this issue becomes a political football with the resulting bad feeling that will be generated
6196382 the milieu of terrorists is invariably morally squalid when it is not merely criminal
6196383 the data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and islamic fundamentalism or any religion for that matter in fact the leading instigator of suicide attacks is the tamil tigers in sri lanka a marxist leninist group whose members are from hindu families but who are adamantly opposed to religion they have have committed 75 of the 188 incidents
6196384 liberal democracies may be able to resist muslim terrorism but the greatest long running threat to secularism democracy and science could come from within from the emerging coalition of the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing for open society that they share with each other and with osama bin laden

6196386 we have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98 tax rates and forced equality of outcome so if monopoly state provision is not the answer what is evidence from around the world shows that just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere so we must trust choice competition in provision and local decision making in public services
6196387 sooner or later there will be a murder of a police officer unless the police are able to deploy ruthlessness in tracking down and wiping out these dissident members
6196388 i believe the community will accept such measures and if dissidents are shot on sight the community will accept that it is a necessary use of lethal force to prevent dissident republicanism from growing
6196389 finally given the seriousness of this most recent murder attempt i believe the stormont executive ought to ensure that a full discussion on the security situation must take place with a view to ensuring every encouragement is given to the police and army in the eradication of dissident republicans
6196390 i was with a friend doing some sightseeing on the wettest day of the year and having set out for a stroll to get a better view of the rope bridge which was closed due to bad weather we came upon three men in a piece of exposed ground under a large cliff face so strange was the situation that im not sure if it was performance art or some patients on day release one man was sitting on a fold up stool he was bald quite old and wearing some manner of an upside down hat which contained a shoe mould as well as a childs shoe another large oldish character was wearing a high viz jacket and lying on the ground staring at a boules petanque ball he occasionally got up to throw it badly according to my friend the boules expert and follow after the ball before getting back down on the ground and resuming his staring meanwhile the third man who was younger than the rest produced a rusty bicycle wheel from a bag and began rolling it around the rough ground every so often he would squeeze an old fashioned low pitched car horn which sounded not unlike a duck quacker this was taking place at approximately 2 30pm on saturday afternoon my questions are there surrealists at large on the causeway coast and if so naturally is this art or is a local institution missing some of its in patients

6196394 it had been through the whole process of checking rivers agency were happy with it we were happy with it and the roads service were happy with the design we put forward or else nobody would have signed on it nobody anticipated the amount of rain we had and i dont think the finger pointing is going to help we just have to see how we are going to get over this problem and prevent it in the future
6196395 the decision to realign the clowney river to the south of the underpass rather than integrate it into the roof slab has been a major factor in allowing us to reprogramme the work to finish this part early this allowed us to deal more efficiently with numerous overhead and underground services and keep traffic running during the construction
6196396 the chinese boxer other finalist zou shiming beat barnes convincingly in the world championships in chicago last year
6196397 the notion that christianity in general and evangelicalism in particular are by nature right wing creeds has always been wrong how can a faith built around a commitment to the poor and the vulnerable be seen as leading ineluctably to conservative political conclusions
6196398 it was mccains night obama made no big mistakes but his tendency to somewhat windy generalities meant he wasnt particularly compelling mccain who went second was crisp by contrast and his anecdotes colorful
6196399 members of the orange order belong to the institution because they are firmly committed to their reformed protestant faith and in a world where secular values are changing the societies in which we live our faith is important to us
6196400 they might think they are being smart issuing that type of answer but it is showing that they are burying their heads in the sand many members have been very positive about the suggestion internally but nothing has happened at an official level yet

6196420 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6196421 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6196422 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo

6196424 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley

6196471 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6196472 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6196473 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6196474 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6196476 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6196477 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6196478 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

6196480 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6196481 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6196482 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6196483 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6196484 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6196485 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6196486 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6196487 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6196488 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6196489 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6196490 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6196491 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6196492 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity

6196494 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6196495 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6196496 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6196497 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6196498 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6196499 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6196500 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6196501 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets

6196506 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6196507 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6196508 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6196509 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6196510 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6196511 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6196512 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6196513 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6196514 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6196515 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6196516 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6196517 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6196518 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6196519 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6196520 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6196521 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

6196525 the man sat between the two brothers and suddenly began stabbing the seat
6196526 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6196527 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6196528 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6196529 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6196530 the incident which has been widely reported as yet another example of personal data vulnerability may have particularly negative implications for priva because of the similarities in our brand names an issue that is being litigated
6196531 we are pursuing legal proceedings because our trademark rights and our registration both predate vip s mark by several years
6196532 ironically in addition to authenticating user credentials for access control priva s cleared technology has earned one of the government s highest certifications for its ability to provide exceptionally high levels of data protection to thwart intruders who might steal a laptop such as the one lost in san francisco
6196533 our intention is to initiate our clearedtraveler tm program soon after phase one deployment of the cleared platform for employee access control which is currently underway at several unidentified airports
6196534 our initial focus is on providing the technology for controlling who gets to go where within the confines of the airport
6196535 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6196536 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6196537 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6196538 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6196539 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6196540 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6196541 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6196542 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6196543 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6196544 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6196545 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6196546 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6196547 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6196548 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6196549 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6196550 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6196551 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6196552 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6196553 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6196554 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6196555 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6196556 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6196557 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6196558 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6196559 this is a planning took where all things are going
6196560 we had two of the most bearish factors thrown at oil today and were closing moderately higher
6196561 were seeing supply concerns go back into the price of a barrel of oil
6196562 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6196563 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6196564 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6196565 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6196566 ill start representing kids when kids start paying union dues
6196567 people who have certain characteristics with adhd such as conduct disorders eating disorders or depression require very different treatment and follow a more complicated path as they grow into adulthood
6196568 the risk for eating disorders in adhd we can say with more confidence now may be under recognized
6196569 3 years in the life of a 17 year old girl is a significant chunk of life
6196570 these findings indicate that major depression emerging in the context of adhd is an impairing and severe comorbidity worthy of further clinical and scientific interest
6196571 physicians need to keep adhd in mind when women are being treated for anxiety or depression and have continued symptoms that do not fully coincide with those diagnoses
6196572 these patients might be more emotionally labile and irritable than one would expect to see in anxiety and depression
6196573 this study was interesting because the inattention subtype of adhd is more commonly seen in girls
6196574 the number of women who had the combined subtype was more common than is conventionally seen in a combined subtype
6196575 there could be a selection bias because inattentive subtype often goes undiagnosed while the combined type is more conspicuous
6196576 however this study may help more women get diagnosed if physicians are aware of undiagnosed adhd in women they can identify it more frequently if you are aware you will see that it is more common than you realize
6196577 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6196578 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6196579 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6196580 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6196581 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6196582 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6196583 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6196584 take charge of your finances 3 action steps that will lead to financial sanity
6196585 people matter politically only as members of groups and groups matter only when they act
6196586 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6196587 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6196588 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6196589 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6196590 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6196591 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6196592 that would be an issue his administration would have to face early because hes pledging to be a uniter not a divider without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 hes pledging to change the way washington works and if congress were to pursue that it would be very divisive
6196593 that could be very problematic for his presidency right off the start
6196594 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6196595 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6196596 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6196597 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6196598 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6196599 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6196600 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6196601 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6196602 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6196603 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6196604 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6196605 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6196606 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6196607 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6196608 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6196609 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6196620 well what w as i supposed to do the power has been out for days
6196621 this season will see a number of initiatives introduced in the professional and grass roots game
6196622 ill sign up with the caucus to protect my seniority
6196623 my seniority is important to my ability to deliver for the state of connecticut
6196624 there is a little playfulness in me that wants me to make a joke about that but its too serious the answer is no
6196625 when i give my word i stick with it and i am definitely going to organize with the senate democrats
6196626 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front
6196627 i just want to concentrate on my performances and play well because its not nice for the fans to have an ongoing thing but i will be a chelsea player for the rest of my career
6196628 i just wanted to put it to bed now obviously we wanted to get it sorted out this year but with the new manager coming in and players coming in and out there wasnt enough time
6196629 thierry henry was one of my heroes as a kid when i met him for the first time at arsenal i was star struck
6196630 for the first couple of weeks i was just in awe now im wearing his old shirt number 14 but i dont feel under more pressure i just see it as another number i knew what to expect when i first grabbed it and it really doesnt bother me ill just play my football and work hard
6196631 i actually asked for number eight first but samir nasri took that so the next available number was 14
6196632 help help these arent real police help help theyre trying to kidnap me

6196648 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6196649 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6196650 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6196651 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6196652 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6196653 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6196654 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6196655 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6196656 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6196657 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6196658 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6196659 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6196660 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6196661 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6196664 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6196665 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6196666 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6196667 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6196668 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6196669 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6196670 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6196671 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6196672 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6196673 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me
6196674 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6196675 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6196676 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6196677 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6196678 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6196679 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6196680 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6196681 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6196682 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6196683 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
6196684 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
6196685 there are serious problems that must be addressed the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
6196686 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6196687 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6196688 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6196689 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6196690 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6196691 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6196692 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6196700 then we turn the stamp over and transfer the electrolyte and anode to a platinum structure

6196702 its our perspective that most numbers on algae yield are far in excess of reality some are beyond theoretical
6196703 but youre not going to see 100 00 gallons per acre any time soon
6196704 we need to see a model that can be propagated at large scale once we see that model then we can see that templated and brought forward
6196705 when you get to economics you have to ask how are we valuing carbon
6196706 like other officials in russia the justices are susceptible to influence within a society that assumes policies are set at the top putins suggestions undoubtedly trickle down through the judicial hierarchy para 20 the russian executive uses the courts to pursue its agenda just as it did in the soviet era the system is still deeply entrenched in the mindset of that era a large number of judges were appointed before the collapse of the soviet system and most of the remainder before the latest reforms in cases which concern the interests of the state they very often defer to the wishes of the executive
6196707 the use of criminal prosecutions or the threat of them as tools in a power struggle with rivals was a feature of soviet russia
6196708 even if england is not the natural forum the claimant may establish the second stage that substantial justice will or may not be done in the natural forum so that justice requires that the case be tried in england if he does so then the case cannot be tried there more suitably in the interests of the parties and for the ends of justice and england will be the proper place
6196709 taking all those considerations into account i am persuaded that the risks inherent in a trial in russia assassination arrest on trumped up charges and lack of a fair trial are sufficient to make england the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interests of both parties and the ends of justice and accordingly the proper place for the determination of this claim
6196710 although information was missed inadvertently in our previous press release i am pleased that the revisions add to the already substantial amount of work that has been done at lost creek
6196711 the 2008 drilling program continues on schedule and is expected to conclude on time and within budget

6196830 last night on hannity and colmes bob beckel tried to argue that neither obama nor naral supports the selective killing of infants
6196831 its quite clear whats going on the radical pro abortionists and no one is more radical than obama and naral will even defend selective infanticide if there is one chance in a million that it will chip away at roe v wade incredibly even naral eventually dropped its opposition to the bill something obama never did his campaign now admits that the wording of the illinois bill and the federal bill were virtually identical which means that when it comes to abortion obama wins the gold

6196864 in an alternate history where martin luther was assassinated the reformation never took place and the catholic church still reigns supreme
6196865 in a world where the inquisition still runs rampant europe is ruled by monarchs but magic manages to exist
6196866 not because hes a comic reader but because hes keenly interested in the templar knights
6196867 how often do they change the sheets who does the laundry
6196868 i like anything thats shocking and out of the ordinary i still subscribe to ranger rick
6196869 first i want to point out that at us 6 and change mpel is trading at a very slight premium to its book value as a management team we do not believe that this fairly values our company we think a lot of the negativity that currently drives sentiment towards gaming stocks is overdone especially stocks like mpel which are totally isolated from any downturn in the u s economy of course we understand that competitive conditions in the rolling chip market in macau have dropped results by ama in june resulting in concerns about our ability to retain market share so far our first quarter hold has been very good at crown macau and we are happy with our current market share performance we will keenly monitor what impact the current travel restrictions together with the distraction of the olympics has on growth in the overall gaming market again we stress that this must be considered for what it is short term variance on what is an intact long term growth and investment story we believe that the street has priced in headwinds which we do not see on the ground here in macau
6196870 looking forward from the current quarter we will revise our expectations of target hold in the rolling chip segment from 2 7 to 2 85 were making this change to bring mpel in line with what we believe to be the consensus opinion of expected rolling chip hold rates in macau please note that vip hold at crown macau is 2 94 year to date we think that this decision brings us in line with the expected hold percentage under the soon to be introduced statutory commission cap environment
6196871 but to speak quite frankly the level of scrutiny on hold rates from this day to that or from one week to the next is in our view excessive
6196872 though the specific government approved process remains somewhat uncertain for cotai we continue to review the option of monetizing assets at city of dreams at the macau peninsula site the realization of this process at either project would provide meaningful liquidity and enhance next term we expect to make a final determination regarding the monetization of assets at city of dreams in the coming months as our neighbor navigates this process and tests the water for buyer demand
6196873 our balance sheet is conservative and well positioned to complete our current development pipeline our existing debt to equity ratio is just 25 our next brand city of dreams was effected yesterday by the macau government which represents a major milestone in the government approval process and for the financing of the project itself
6196874 there is a debate about the ability of crown to compete for volumes in the rolling chip segment following the expected implementation of the 1 25 commission cap later this year in a moment lawrence will provide more color on this but our strongly held view is that crown can and will remain competitive in this new environment we believe all who operate under the new commission cap regime will achieve rolling chip margin performance improvement
6196875 we continue to vigorously support the governments effort to implement a cap on junket commission i believe that they will be good for the market and good for mpel in a commission cap operating environment the focus of competition will be on the provision of working capital the quality of the player experience especially on the casino floor and the ability of the operators to manage a broad spectrum of third party junket relationships as simon mentioned earlier on we are confident that we will continue to prosper in this environment we believe the government is serious about these measures and will formulate a plan and and law that will aggressively enforce visa restriction and well provide adequate energy to ensure the volume i can reassure all our shareholders that we will fully comply with admission cap in all aspects of our operation ill close by reminding everyone that macau is a small city with about 28 kilometres of landmass and with very limited opportunity to expand its existing footprint
6196876 theres robust reservation and gaming revenue growth since the implementation of visa restrictions in 2008 we continue to believe that the impact on growth in the market will be manageable the visa restriction that started on august 1 reduced the length of stay for a transit visitor to 7 days from 14 days this should not be meaningful in a market where our average length of stay is still not at two days the visa restrictions taking effect on september 1 are somewhat more difficult to predict as they will require visitors to apply for two separate visas in order to visit hong kong and macau this mainly impacts those coming to macau under the individual value obtained this will off favor a mass market visitor to macau while the impact of this change is difficult to predict the impact on crown macau should be manageable given that the property focuses almost exclusively on vip guests we will keep a close watch on this as this clearly affects the process for city of dreams and city of dreams will rest heavily on the premium mass market visitor even part of that visa restriction can just as easily return if they interfere with the development of cotai and the emergence of non gaming amenity and the environment at macau
6196877 macaus gaming market are tied to the booming chinese economy and not the u s economy this distinction is obvious but is not currently recognized by the financial markets as china continues to grow it is creating enormous wealth and a growing mineral spot i believe that we are in the early stages of witnessing chinas transformation from a largely export driven economy to a consumer driven economy macau is highly leveraged to the extent and mpels development pipeline is designed to tap into the growing affluence of the chinese consumer
6196878 the senator wanted the list of speakers to showcase the
6196879 im going with the clean style of czs pages and created two 12 x 12 templates for myself based on czs
6196880 what obama represents is we as a people are a part of the american dream
6196881 the message is for a kid from in marcy projects right now to say maybe i can be the president
6196882 not just for us blacks but also with all americans i think theres so much our president can do obama seems like a human being i say that because a lot of presidents dont seem like human beings they seem like straight up businessmen who care about nothing but the business
6196883 were a small part of it but were showing our support to show that we are aware of whats going on and where its going
6196884 we really want change we really need it its not the same no more
6196885 listen to what hes saying hes saying what i wanna hear just like my favorite rapper if an mc is saying what i wanna hear imma go buy his album if a candidate is saying what i wanna hear imma go vote for him i can vote by the way watch me im going to register to vote
6196886 i think the first thing the hip hop community has to do is let the man become president
6196887 they gotta work in other ways to get him in the white house its not really about doing a song right now he has to separate himself from that stuff hes in a political race everybody should kick back for a minute see what happens in november if he becomes president he wouldnt have to separate himself as much from some of these statements because obama cant come as hard core as ludacris as far as his message right now he cant do that us rappers might have to hold our tongues for a few months
6196888 all it takes is for a mutha er getting out there being real ghetto and people will be like we dont wanna f with obama theyll wanna smash on him because of what somebody else said someone speaks for himself and its baracks fault what did luda say thats baracks fault is it baracks fault what im saying i dont wanna be the reason he dont get the presidency
6196889 the most problematic hip hop gets 90 percent of the coverage in the non music press
6196890 hip hop is associated in so many peoples minds with crime drugs and misogyny so obamas faced with a constellation of problematic images the question is how do you send a message that doesnt wind up demonizing somebody
6196891 its cool to make a couple comments but be careful about what you say because theyre gonna try to pin it towards him
6196892 we know its so much tension around politics right now theyre trying to take him down maybe everybody needs to chill out a little bit im not sure how much barack mixtapes are helping him i dont think no person is doing a mixtape addressing baracks political views
6196893 i dont think luda or anybody ever thought it would be that big i heard the freestyle the minute it came out and in his defense thats what people do on the mixtape circuit ive put out multiple mixtapes where i might not actually feel a certain way about somebody but ill say a punch line to give them that shock value its nothing new to the mixtape circuit i dont think he really wants mccain in a wheelchair the lyric reads mccain dont belong in any chair unless hes paralyzed its just a freestyle thing it was crazy they took it that big
6196894 during this election young people from all walks of life have responded to senator obamas message of hope and change for the future with great enthusiasm
6196895 and that includes those in the hip hop community individuals who are talented intelligent and entrepreneurial in spirit but who in the past have felt that government and politics dont really work for them
6196896 senator obama wants to engage the hip hop community more in the political process because issues including education jobs and health care are as important to this generation as any other we will be talking to the hip hop community more throughout this campaign and letting them know they have reason to put their trust in senator obama because he will work to fundamentally change their lives
6196897 the hip hop experience is for some the black experience and the campaign has been very inclusive and has been one that has welcomed voices from all over the country
6196898 with the hip hop community its been an interesting conversation because on the one hand we know the hip hop community has reflected a great deal of whats been happening in our inner cities for a long time and the systemic challenges that face that community senator obama has a plan as part of his overall call for change that will address those challenges the voice of the hip hop community will be reflected in this campaign with senator obamas plan for inner city communities
6196899 these situations are a case by case basis when and where and timing
6196900 the hip hop community has clearly embraced senator obama and they see him as someone who can effect change in a dramatic way the key with us as we go through the next few months is identifying opportunities where we can work together to communicate the senators message
6196901 i thought about hip hop associations harming obamas chances i really did
6196902 so in the concert i always say this is not sponsored by obama i make it very clear to say that cause i know obama associated with this guy from f in marcy projects i know thats coming any day i think about that often i mean what do you do what do i do i have to support the guy but i dont wanna hurt him i aint like the preachers and all those guys i dont wanna make the inappropriate statements and keep going im the guy that will fall back
6196903 you gotta speak what you feel you gotta be respectful though
6196904 like anything you do you cant come to anybodys show and be disrespectful if youre supporting them so you dont speak on nobody and act a fool
6196905 in some ways you have to assume most of the hip hop community will be behind him because they dont have a choice because their vote aint going to mccain
6196906 but if he uses this kind of secret code the dirt off the shoulder saying you and i both know it but i cant afford to say so it could work for him
6196907 rappers have to realize that supporting obama publicly is like a corporate meeting come support us but dress for the occasion
6196908 its hard you wanna see him be a part of it more but you know the powers that be are going to make it such a big deal theyll be like obama was with dude who was smoking weed i would love to see obama go on and show his involvement show hes not trying to distance himself
6196909 if a king goes out and fights wars with his people his people will do anything for him
6196910 if youre just a king in your castle and you calling shots then the respect from the people will never be there we dont see our leaders with us in our situations on a heavy heavy level
6196911 a lot of people may not feel me on this but you gotta feel me if you real im not voting for obama
6196912 i dont like obama obama is a traitor he turned his back on everybody he turned his back on reverend wright has been with him since the beginning ludacris has done stuff in his support he speaks the truth but obama feels that a certain demographic may not vote for him because of it so he turns his back on luda he invited bernie mac to come in and do his roast or whatever it was called bernie mac said some things that were offensive thats what bernie mac is known for what does he do turn his back on bernie mac whos he gonna denounce next im not even voting this year if i did vote it would be for mccain i like to know the enemy barack i dont know
6196913 having a young person like obama run for president has inspired many in the hip hop community
6196914 but hes running for president so hes not going to endorse any one genre of music or any one aspect of a cultural phenomenon like hip hop because hes going to be the president of all americans
6196915 those stupid kids wont appreciate that bear like we would
6196916 well we can mourn skip caray with this luscious impersonation of his dad by the braves own for now will ohman
6196917 i think ill be a turtle but i could end up being a hare how about ill be a speedy turtle or a slow hare a turtare
6196918 inititally i started out with simplicity in mind and well the fact of the matter is i didnt bank on me being such an interesting individual
6196919 the best tip ive found is to make a full abc topic list or close to it anyway before starting your pages in case you need to move a topic to a different letter ie
6196920 observar os detalhes ajuda a profissionalizar ter uma mesinha com caf gua e afins melhor do que convidar um cliente ou visitante para ir cozinha preciso deixar o ambiente claro e arejado contando com m veis e paredes em tons suaves e persianas ou cortinas novas e limpas
6196921 i do it all for the sake of the gospel that i may share with them in its blessings do you not know that in a race all the runners compete but only one receives the prize so run that you may obtain it every athlete exercises self control in all things they do it to receive a perishable wreath but we an imperishable so i do not run aimlessly i do not box as one beating the air but i discipline my body and keep it under control lest after preaching to others i myself should be disqualified

6196940 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6196941 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6196942 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6196943 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6196944 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6196945 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6196946 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6196947 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6196948 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6196949 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6196950 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6196951 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6196952 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6196953 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6196954 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6196955 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6196956 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6196957 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6196958 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6196959 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6196960 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6196961 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6196962 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6196963 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6196964 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6196965 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6196966 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6196967 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6196968 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6196969 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6196970 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6196971 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6196972 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6196973 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6196974 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6196975 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

6196987 i knew bill for more than 30 years he was a heck of a guy and a strong supporter of our group
6196988 it was reported that bill gwatney had been shot in the chest officials arrived on the scene and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died at 4 p m
6196989 he just came into the building and asked to speak to chairman gwatney the secretary spoke to bill and later brought the man to see him where he introduced himself as tim anderson within seconds he pulled a gun and shot the chairman
6196990 immediately following anderson left the building and walked eight blocks to the baptist convention center he stayed briefly before going back outside and getting into a blue dodge dakota a unit was close and they chased him through little rock toward the pine bluff and sheridan area
6196991 at the end of the chase anderson came out of his car with a pistol police then shot and killed him
6196992 the reason he shot gwatney is not known at this time the state police are handling the killing of timothy anderson and were handling the homicide investigation of bill gwatney
6196993 he had quit his job that morning and was reported to have written graffiti messages in various parts of town a search warrant was obtained to investigate andersons home a note was found there with gwatneys name two sets of keys various guns and other items
6196994 he might have been a stalker as it is with movie stars sometimes when it comes to gwatney we may never get an answer it might have been that he didnt like his cars
6196995 i spent 180 000 on my campaign and my opponent spent three and a half million on his yet i am known as the rich man and he is known as the poor one
6196996 i believe we have done our job as a church well
6196997 if we cant marry and bury you then we have not
6196998 the gwatney funeral is the biggest story that has happened in our area in a long time and it was carried throughout the state we were the only station that aired it live on television and on the web in total we had more than 800 people watching it online
6196999 for us the challenge was finding a way to provide the public with coverage of the funeral and balance that coverage with the details of the crime scene while paying respect to the family we were able to achieve that because the church has its own video production and provided a live feed that was a lot less intrusive on the family and their privacy
6197000 lord make me an instrument of thy peace where there is hatred let me sow love where there is injury pardon where there is doubt faith where there is despair hope where there is darkness light and where there is sadness joy o divine master grant that i may not so much seek to be consoled as to console to be understood as to understand to be loved as to love for it is in giving that we receive it is in pardoning that we are pardoned and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life

6197002 does not allow for the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials it measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country it measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile and it can tell us everything about america except why we are proud that we are americans
6197003 few will have the greatness to bend history itself but each of us can work to change a small portion of events and in the totality of those acts will be written the history of this generation
6197004 these kids showed up in good shape theyve worked hard in the off season its shows
6197005 well the equation is just in theory we wouldnt have you making specific decisions based on the numbers
6197006 ok if a mutual fund family runs many funds all having access to the same research then logic dictates that the best ideas will be ones bought by many of their funds at the same time
6197007 in line with this idea i find that trades made by more than one fund beat the benchmarks by up to about 0 3 per month in the quarter subsequent to when funds trade moreover such trades outperform trades made by single funds by even higher margins abnormal returns do not revert in the next six quarters which suggests that the result is not driven by transitory liquidity e ects interestingly the value of best ideas
6197008 while managers correctly evaluate what information is the most valuable they do not limit their trades to the best ideas

6197017 hey professors youre really really old now so dont think you can pretend to be
6197018 all i really need to know i learned in kindergarten
6197019 this move is consistent with the fact that the racing commissions believed the existing classification of a positive for these steroids was not sufficiently serious based upon the unanimous opinion of the drug testing standards and practices committee as well as the majority recommendation of the veterinary pharmacology subcommittee
6197020 there is no specific evidence which clearly establishes the mechanism by which hydergine ergoloid mesylates preparations produce mental effects nor is there conclusive evidence that the drug particularly affects cerebral arteriosclerosis or cerebrovascular insufficiency

6197030 thats why government intervenes whether its fannie and freddie or bear stearns or circumstances like that
6197031 if policy makers were confident that the problems could be confined to the institution in question then you could certainly let that fail

6197299 as playstation network continues to evolve with our recently launched video delivery service and more exclusive games ps3 owners are demanding more storage capacity

6197307 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6197308 im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that
6197309 its a gamble because the democratic party has real issues with lieberman

6197316 it was the largest and most organized effort ever to spread misinformation about ethanol we took a pounding in the east coast media
6197317 its been a summer long campaign that started in june and will wrap up on labor day
6197318 weve been pushing ethanol for 25 to 30 years so were used to misinformation campaigns but opponents had a battle plan this time

6197324 well over half a million children are in schools that gordon brown has said should be taken over or closed because they are failing
6197325 the governments target of having no school where more than 70 of children are failing to get these five good grades is hopelessly unambitious
6197326 these flawed and misleading tables are a travesty of fair reporting

6197329 there are very few drugs with strong evidence of effectiveness in treating trigeminal neuralgia
6197330 if people fail to respond to these drugs physicians should not be reluctant to consider referring the patient for surgery often surgery is considered a last resort and patients suffer while the well intentioned physician tries other medications with limited effectiveness
6197331 if patients dont respond well to carbamazepine or one or two other drugs it is reasonable to consider surgery that targets the root of the trigeminal nerve
6197332 people with trigeminal neuralgia should be aware of the availability of surgical treatments and discuss these options with their physicians

6197342 we categorically reject that any sudanese be tried outside sudan we will never surrender any citizen to be tried abroad
6197343 the attempt to use the so called international justice against the country is an attempt to encourage rebel groups opposing peace to continue destruction and destabilisation to topple the regime in sudan
6197344 its own judicial institutions and is capable of trying anyone who violates justice
6197345 we will not hand over any sudanese citizen no matter what pressure there is even if we have to go to war
6197346 we are ready for war against the superpowers in order to protect sudanese citizens
6197347 that the suffering in darfur must definitely stop that human rights must be respected and that the sudanese government should make great efforts to that end

6197359 norway has received information that russia has decided to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries until further notice
6197360 the russian defence ministry had telephoned the norwegian embassy in moscow
6197361 its a chance for the younger guys to see what a weekly routine looks like its going to be great for everyone involved for the veterans and for the young guys
6197362 youve got to have the same routine week in and week out you want to understand whats going on and you want to be comfortable when game time comes
6197363 it really helps our young guys get acclimated to how we do things
6197364 hopefully that will cause us to sharpen up well also structure our practice time where everybodys not going to get the same amount of practice time and we will focus on the starters and the guys who are going to play a little bit more this week
6197365 it helps out a lot now we have defensive schemes set were going to run our defense based on what they run were not just going to go run our base defense no matter what they play
6197366 this is the first time were doing that it helps us out a lot in terms of getting an advantage in the game
6197367 it helped me a lot as a rookie just being able to see how things were going to go in the regular season you follow the older guys and let them lead the way and follow in their footsteps
6197368 i always like to do that in the third preseason game get us playing in the third quarter so we get the feel for what we do at halftime and how we make adjustments incorporating that into the second half id say those guys would play into the third quarter for sure
6197369 it just kind of gets you back in the groove and that routine of all the meetings in the morning and then the afternoon practice
6197370 its definitely something thats a little different from camp in camp we have practice in the morning and practice in the afternoon and meetings in between
6197371 now we get back on that routine well have until the playoffs
6197372 okay im never gonna get to learn to fly or whatever it is

6197376 w e can provide loan guarantees and venture capital to those with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market
6197377 it seems to me that the government has decided to junk its recent attempts to introduce a measure of sophistication into evaluating schools in favour of a crude headline grabbing measure to try to show that it is tough on standards
6197378 the support outlined in the national challenge programme will be obscured by this injustice
6197379 teachers and head teachers will be very wary of wanting to join schools that could be threatened with closure
6197380 the nut will not stand by and watch the vilification of school communities and the intolerable pressure put on heads and teachers as a result of the governments arbitrary actions
6197381 but we are determined to tackle failure in the education system where we see it
6197382 despite this our numbers have increased by 48 and for the past three years our cva score has placed us in the top 4 of all state schools in england
6197383 in may 2007 ofsted concluded that we were an outstanding school
6197384 last year our cva was 1031 6 but unfortunately we fell below the arbritary 30 including english and maths target for the first time in several years
6197385 as a result we have been named and shamed so from outstanding head to duffer in a year
6197386 the local press last week used the words failing and closure in their report can you imagine the effect this has had on staff and pupil morale
6197387 what effect it will have on pupil recruitment in the future
6197388 this is not about failing schools there are a large number of these schools that are high achieving successful schools

6197402 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6197403 but we are far from complacent and know there is more to do to ensure that every pupil has the opportunity to reach their full potential and we have a world class system everywhere
6197404 four in 10 pupils leave primary school without mastering the basics
6197405 we must give teachers the powers they need to restore order in schools and get back to tried and tested reading methods
6197406 the shame is that these excellent results are hitched to a league table system which undermines a large number of successful schools
6197407 league tables are beyond repair attempts to modify league tables only serve to emphasise their unfairness
6197408 there is no doubt that at best league tables of raw test data simply show where rich people live
6197409 at worst they are entirely demoralising to schools and whole communities who are at this point in time working as hard as they can to bring high quality education to hearts and minds that have never enjoyed that privilege before in the history of this nation
6197410 mother im really proud of you because you are a pioneer

6197412 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6197413 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6197414 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6197415 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6197506 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games

6197508 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
6197509 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6197510 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6197511 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years

6197513 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6197514 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie
6197515 two of my riders approached me saying they wanted to talk about the medical program
6197516 i thought he was going to follow it up with a little laugh or something but he didnt
6197517 he was quite serious and i said okay he said you know your comments were really damaging and i said yeah but they were really true and he said no they werent and i said of course they were and i started to walk away knowing that the conversation wasnt going to go anywhere
6197518 i got maybe 10 feet away and he said no come on i want to talk to you about it i hesitated but thought maybe well resolve this once and for all i went back he said something im not sure what he said and i said something like twelve years later were still trying to clean up the mess you idiots made and that was when he punched me it was over before i even knew what happened i didnt know someone could hit someone so fast
6197519 understood and apologized but that he needed marty to make the stage happen safely
6197520 it was not the greatest display of self control but he turned around and stuck his chest out and raised his voice and made that comment which is a flat out lie there was nothing to his claim they are groundless accusations and it struck a nerve
6197521 i dont know how a guy like this with his past and his history can go around making statements like that i support what he is trying to do with what garmin chipotle is doing in terms of running a clean team
6197522 but steffen has a dark ugly past and if hes going to make statements about other people i think the public should know if he really knew something from 1996 lets hear it there is nothing there was nothing we knew nothing in 1996
6197523 i think marty has done an exceptional job for me at this race he went above and beyond anything i anticipated to be honest i thought i was hiring the local cycling celebrity and it would be good pr to have him involved with the race but he really took it to heart and did a fabulous job and worked well with all the teams and was an extra set of hands that i desperately needed and did a fantastic job anything between him and prentice to me is personal and didnt affect his job at all frankly all that is in the past it was unfortunate that all that happened during my event and in front of a lot of people but it had nothing to do with the tour of utah or the fabulous event we had
6197524 i understand his pent up anger and frustration but it cant be released in that sort of manner
6197525 theres a whole set of factors that go into the ultimate cost of energy

6197559 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6197560 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters

6197562 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6197563 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board

6197573 dancap did not negotiate for or obtain from key brand any restraint on alienation that would limit key brands right to sell the theatres nor did it negotiate for or obtain a right of first refusal or even a right of first negotiation on the sale of the theatres dancap was aware that the theatres would be sold either by way of a sale or sale leaseback as soon as possible after the closing of key brands acquisition of the live nation assets to fulfill a condition imposed by j p morgan dancap was also aware that pursuant to the co presenting agreement a lease agreement mirvish had a preexisting right of first negotiation on the canon theatre that would be triggered on a sale of the canon theatre
6197574 dancap has no competing ownership rights of the theatres and in my view there is no basis for dancap to stop the sale of the theatres to mirvish in my view dancap has failed to establish that there is a serious issue to be tried with respect to the ability of key brand to sell the theatres

6197576 we are pleased with this decision and can now focus on the job of planning an even brighter theatrical future for the city of toronto and throughout canada we have always acted entirely in the best interests of the shareholders of key brand including aubrey dan while we want him to become a successful producer and wish him well with the opening of jersey boys in toronto next week we believe that the theatrical community flourishes when everyone works together for the good of the audience negotiation via litigation threats and innuendo is not how we want to do business i just hope we can now all work together for that brighter future

6197582 it can be difficult even painful to look back on our own mistakes its tempting to focus on the obvious triumphs or ignore history altogether in our constant quest for a better tomorrow but im convinced theres much to be gained from thoughtful candid and probing self examination and that requires an honest look at what happened

6197866 adrians campaign to raise awareness about blood bone marrow and organ donation has already attracted thousands of supporters myself among them and his memory will continue to inspire action for many years to come
6197867 i spoke to adrian last wednesday and his campaigning spirit and his optimism remained undimmed
6197868 my thoughts are with his family at this time and i know they will be proud that adrians achievements will continue to help others after he has gone

6197870 unfortunately a close inspection of obamas proposals reveals something disquieting he would raise marginal tax rates for many middle income taxpayers a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth
6197871 the key point that brill and viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes
6197872 virtually the whole government debt story is due to projections of exploding health care costs
6197873 what pretense to assert as did kenneth griffin recipient last year of more than 1 billion in compensation as manager of the citadel investment group that the current income distribution has to stand if the tax became too high as a matter of principle i would not be working this hard right far better to admit as has warren buffett that the tax rates of the wealthiest americans average nearly 15 while those of their salaried and therefore less incentivized assistants just outside their offices are nearly twice that
6197874 so the major themes of these two plans are in the case of senator mccains plan that the major emphasis is on economic efficiency cuts in marginal tax rates improves economic incentives
6197875 in the case of obamas plan the goal is primarily to improve progressivity to lower tax burdens on low income people and raise them on higher income people

6197878 try to imagine the scope involved in having to print multiple copies of paper reports that need to reach a host of employees spread out over dozens of hospital departments
6197879 compound this scenario with printers jamming and reports being misplaced misfiled or lost before reaching the employees who need direct and timely access to the information and what you have is a paper silo nightmare
6197880 getting a handle on paper expenditures while providing accurate and timely report information to accounting and other departments is critical to long term financial viability and it is something that we pride ourselves on at db technology
6197881 we are honored to be working with kingman regional medical center and are pleased to witness the benefits that ras technology brings to their facility
6197882 we wanted an archival system so that reports would be available to be viewed for an extended length of time and we needed a system that was compatible with our existing data mining monarch software
6197883 ras was the only system able to address all of the issues in a single solution
6197884 with ras reports can now easily be sent electronically reducing the paper burden and reprinting of a motley collection of reports for example monthly expense reports used to be printed and managers would have to write on them to justify expenditures now these documents are available on ras enabling managers to electronically send a report to accounting the bottom line is a huge cost savings in time paper and manual labor
6197885 we credit db technology with providing us an easy to use easy to maintain solution that is backed by optimized security and superior customer service paper silos are a thing of the past

6198126 i think it was a good performance from the team especially the first half the last half an hour of the first half i thought we kept the ball really well possession was very very good and we went in deservedly 1 0 ahead
6198127 the second half was a completely different game we hadnt a lot of possession but i was disappointed with the pitch because the first half we played great stuff
6198128 its always nice to score as a striker but its important to score for the team and that is the most important thing it would have been nice to have held out for the win but it wasnt to be

6198156 michelle is speaking out about the john mccain campaign ad that likened her husband barack to a celebrity on the order of paris hilton
6198157 its funny to have anybody characterize barack as an elitist you know this is the kid who was raised by a single mother who didnt have access to many resources who you know has walked away his entire life from lucrative careers to work in the community this guy you know he personifies all of what you know we hope that our kids can be

6198165 its a unit that raises a child as far as im concerned in this couple barack is the person who has the skill the inclination the desire the ability to be in politics i have no desire
6198166 so thats a good thing in my view since someone has to be focusing on the kids and thats me but it could easily be him theres no reason why the nurturing has to come from mom it just has to be there
6198167 it touches me when our girls touch him whether its with a story or a word you can see it in his face thats the leader i want somebody who is so moved by his own children that hell go out there and fight for everyone elses

6198192 i dont want to say anymore because i dont want to start an inter country war
6198193 it was really crowded going around the corners there was a lot of grabbing and pulling but i have to say i was no angel either
6198194 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied

6198214 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
6198215 the challenge for many sellers is determining the right price for todays market conditions there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from record sales and price increase levels of 2007
6198216 2008 will end with an economic growth of 1 economic recession is when the economy declines over the course of a year at 1 the economy is not in recession so theres no point in talking about it
6198217 economic growth rates falling by 0 3 record deficits in commercial exchanges industrial production taking a downturn and the return of inflation the french economy is showing all the signs of a recession

6198227 a long term negative for ti based on share loss
6198228 this takes the ericsson mobile platform farther out of equation in my opinion

6198230 il a tourn un peu dans la baie puis il est parti
6198231 maybe thats what life is all about holding on and hoping
6198232 the development team thats working on it is playing it and weve released some alpha builds to some other development teams internally and then the quality assurance department is also playing it
6198233 exposure to pro players is more opportunistic we hosted an event in korea that was an e sport event for warcraft iii and starcraft and we had a playable starcraft ii build that we brought along to give the pro players an opportunity to play it and give us some feedback its a new luxury for us to have this community of pro players playing our in development games so definitely when we have the opportunity we try to leverage it
6198234 were trying to tell that story in a way we havent done it before and incorporating branching missions that we havent offered to the player
6198235 we still have to expand our internal alpha to include the rest of the organization iterate on that feedback and then we have to evaluate what kind of beta we need whether we need one at all theres a pretty high level of certainty that were going to need a beta and then we have to decide if we want to host beta or a closed beta or both so months
6198236 now he should have never thrown that ball off his back foot boom
6198237 the team that got hot at the right time to reach the super bowl and then got really lucky to win the super bowl
6198238 had i only kicked that fg way back when i would have won this game instead of going into overtime
6198239 that should be enough for any single man in college to sruvive
6198240 the way we can apply this is to use the knowledge to increase or make oil in tissues that dont ordinarily make oil we could get more oil per acre
6198241 it needs to be engineered but that is the basic idea hopefully the leaves can fill up with oil
6198242 i dont care if its right or wrong what i want is more important than whether it is good or evil

6198253 within the community of amateur and professional bigfoot hunters biscardi has a
6198254 ok first of all much as i love living in a world where there are
6198255 suggestion was that the tissue sample was from the intestine of the animal and that the animal had eaten an opossum
6198256 really nelson thats what seems improbable is opossum not a part of the bigfoot diet and is that more improbable than bigfoot just you know existing they know theres tremendous interest in seeing photographs of bigfoot and theyre trying to get people to pay to see hoaxed photos
6198257 might i recommend then not running to press every time somebody tells the old
6198258 he was a con man known in bigfoot circles for years and now it wont be long before everybody knows it
6198259 what i seen what i touched what i felt and what i prodded was not a mask that was sewn on a bear hide ok
6198260 la certezza di esser piccolo nasce quando le distanze ci dividono soffocando le emozioni tiro avanti amore ma il bisogno di calore punge ai fianchi li traballo ancora un po ma che importanza ha amore averti qua amore amarti qua
6198261 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
6198262 depends entirely on if i think it might be fun
6198263 if god is good and all powerful then why do people die and why is there evil in the world
6198264 why do people die and why is there evil in the world
6198265 ah a bright young thing like yourself cant even cut her own roses
6198266 because the man walks around all the time without his pants on
6198267 do you have a drive an ambition a passion or a rage a drive will motivate you to move to l a an ambition will get you an agent a passion will get you an acting job a rage will make you a star
6198268 hello there what are you doing out here all alone
6198269 just do it how one couple turned off the tv and turned on their sex lives for 101 days no excuses
6198270 at first i sort of thought thats funny ha ha
6198271 but i know annie pretty well and she loves a challenge we talked about it more that night and the next morning and i knew she was serious
6198272 when saturday night sex becomes routine that is when couples need to make sure they are still wooing each other by incorporating spontaneity and novelty
6198273 the next morning i woke up and thought we really need to do this
6198274 our marriage really needs to do this thats how it started
6198275 ive got to research it but im always hearing about how women are using sex toys there are sex toys parties its on oprah its supposed to be healthy im nearly forty and ive never even touched one
6198276 you work you commute you have kids you have to clean up make sure they brush their teeth by the time that part of the day is over you are just tired and ready to zone out
6198277 we werent doing it for the sake of doing it
6198278 the point was to see what would happen we treated it like we were dating again we started looking forward to it
6198279 i really think we communicate so much clearer and with so much more honesty now
6198280 there were so many times before that we hadnt even hugged for like three days in a row we gravitate toward rubbing each others backs more we realize how important it is to put the kids to bed and spend time together
6198281 i would love to see this conversation in every home in america
6198282 gay straight with kids or without this is a conversation that people shrink from and yet its so important once you stop making love to your partner you become roommates whether its five times a month or three times a month just being comfortable with that number is most important
6198283 qual o primeiro nome da mulher que faz a limpeza da escola
6198284 as we look to the future we must continue to strengthen the process and ensure a fair process in which the diverse voices in our party and our nation have a chance to be heard
6198285 that is the essential role that the democratic change commission can and will play and we look forward to their recommendations
6198286 constant low level barrage of angst and misery over the prospect of a black president in america
6198287 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it
6198288 i think that officials have every right to be worried
6198289 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6198290 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6198291 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside
6198292 i dont know if he thought about that maybe he didnt care
6198293 we just always have to assume that theres someone out there you know looking to come after us looking to come after the people we protect
6198294 today could be the day and you need to be ready
6198295 the traces of the trade event was certainly outside our normal film program
6198296 but the legacy of slavery and the need for dialogue around race class and privilege is so important how can the philanthropic community address the issue one way is through media and this film is unique in terms of the issue and the funding it received by showcasing it gfem can support and advance funders policy goals
6198297 weve been following this films production over the years and were eager to help get it out there race relations is not an easy subject and one that still is a challenge in terms of engaging the general public
6198298 and while much of the historical information might reside in public archives access is not always encouraged we think the film can stir interest and support people who want to uncover the full story of their communitys past
6198299 eww thats so nasty come on i have really good taste

6198310 why in the recycle thingy cant you just erase it

6198312 because it cleans the words off the pages then sends the blank sheets back to word so they can be used again thats why its called the recycle bin

6198400 we have lost a great leader who had a real vision for leadership and problems that face the country
6198401 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
6198402 he was a very outstanding politician who made a great contribution to his countrys development and regional peace and development
6198403 he attached great importance to zambias relations with china and did a lot for the friendly cooperation between the two countries
6198404 we strongly hope that benedict xvi will make a trip to china
6198405 relations with the vatican are constantly improving we can say that there are big developments
6198406 i have heard nothing to lead me to conclude that either candidate would abandon the doha round
6198407 there are only a handful of us who are political appointees the folks who have developed these negotiating positions the senior officials who represent the united states year in year out in geneva are for the most part career officials
6198408 if we are going to have chance of reaching a near term conclusion
6198409 there are always going to be elections there are always going to be politics intervening
6198410 if there is a deal out there that meets those criteria i dont care when it shows up
6198411 we have to go for it it cant be dictated by our electoral cycle or anyone elses

6198427 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
6198428 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
6198429 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
6198430 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
6198431 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
6198432 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

6198471 smith is making a big deal of the cost of refurbishing oregons capitol building in salem house speaker merkley was a player in the capitol remake of course so were many other legislators including a bevy of republicans the expensive desk gambit it like smiths earlier television commercial that criticized merkley for enacting a rainy day fund which also had republican support both ads reveal an incumbent whos desperate to find a parachute why return sen smith for a third term when hes done so little in two terms smith must come out from behind a phalanx of television advertising and answer that question in person
6198472 loser sen gordon smiths latest campaign ad it berates his democratic challenger house speaker jeff merkley for a 34 million upgrade of the oregon capitol memo to smith those renovations and new furnishings had bipartisan support from legislators p s the oregon legislature manages to balance its budget unlike congress
6198473 the united states has appropriated about 48 billion for iraqi reconstruction since 2003 and has committed all but about 6 billion
6198474 provides far less support for alternative energy and efficiency than many lawmakers had urged
6198475 traditional energy industries including oil natural gas coal electric utilities and nuclear power
6198476 the bill provides 2 6 billion in tax benefits for oil and gas production and refining
6198477 exxon mobil and other oil companies may benefit from 2 6 billion in subsidies in the energy bill
6198478 the legislation would provide 14 5 billion in energy tax breaks including 2 6 billion for oil and gas industries
6198479 senate finance chairman charles e grassley r iowa said the tax breaks were expanded to satisfy demands from congressional backers of the oil and gas industry he said the final version of the bill includes 11 9 billion in tax breaks for the industry
6198480 for theoil and gas industry the legislation provides nearly 12 billion in tax incentives
6198481 thesenate version includes 4 billion in tax credits for producer
6198482 the whole issue does take us away from whats unquestionably the most expensive furniture in oregon politics gordon smiths seat on the senate finance committee where he sits in for bush economic policies on jan 3 2003 when smith joined the committee the national debt after 227 years stood at 6 383 trillion last thursday when smith put up his second furniture ad the national debt had risen to 9 593 trillion the difference in sen smiths language amounts to about a billion credenzas
6198483 the oregon legislature manages to balance its budget unlike congress
6198484 the deal that lawmakers have reached on a rainy day fund is big for oregons future big for the success of this legislative session and big for a state that had lost confidence in its legislature as a place to solve problems party leaders started negotiating again right after the party line votes in the house twenty four hours later speaker jeff merkley d portland minority leader wayne scott r canby and other leaders announced the most important legislative agreement in years a plan to create a rainy day fund and seed it with most of a 290 million corporate tax kicker
6198485 the steep price of new debt raises the level of difficulty for both institutions in remaining solvent as higher interest rate costs cuts steeply into their operating margins thereby threatening both agencies with even deeper losses in coming quarters

6198489 the jeep is used on a regular basis by someone else that isnt the registered owner
6198490 so we are looking for that person and want to talk with him
6198491 we are having trouble locating the person who was said to be driving the jeep
6198492 but that person is definitely someone we want to speak with
6198493 however you made an interesting point are the premium services people paying for the free loaders
6198494 i really loved the script and having done harry potter i wanted to do something different it was quite a challenge
6198495 we have much to celebrate so please take pride in your accomplishments
6198496 its a tough job you deserve it its a tough job
6198497 sometimes we forget to celebrate accomplishments because we decide probably incorrectly that theyre not worth celebrating anymore
6198498 when you choose to take the time to celebrate even the smallest accomplishments you get a little dopamine release and its good for you
6198499 it was great to have everyone together and hear the motivational words from daeschner and metzger
6198500 but seeing all of the messages from the kids was the best theyre why were here and its good to be reminded of that
6198501 no child has failed no staff member has failed and most importantly no administrators have failed
6198502 uit de talrijke vragen en telefoontjes die we kregen na 26 juni toen fortis een noodingreep aankondigde om zijn kapitaal te versterken nvdr bleek toch dat de mensen vooral nood hadden aan informatie aan dialoog een bav is voor ons meer een beslissingsorgaan
6198503 in het verleden heb ik herhaaldelijk gezegd dat ik bereid was om een stap opzij te zetten als ik daarmee fortis van dienst kon zijn maar het is beter voor de continu teit dat ik blijf
6198504 hij wilde niet noodzakelijk weg maar er was na 26 juni zoveel druk ik noem uitdrukkelijk de pers en enkele belangenverenigingen dat er gezamenlijk is besloten dat hij niet meer kon functioneren hij is het slachtoffer geweest van een nooit geziene campagne tegen fortis
6198505 dit was n van de moeilijkste beslissingen uit mijn hele carri re wetende dat vijftien procent van ons kapitaal kleine belgische beleggers zijn maar we hebben geprobeerd een evenwicht te vinden tussen het belang van de onderneming en het belang van de individuele aandeelhouders
6198506 we gingen er eerst vanuit dat we die activa met een meerwaarde zouden kunnen verkopen in juni bleek dat niet het geval gezien de slechte marktomstandigheden en hebben we uitstel gevraagd aan europa maar niet gekregen
6198507 zij is neutraal maar wel gebonden aan de regels die de laatste jaren in het nadeel van grote spelers op kleine markten zijn ge volueerd
6198508 an unexamined belief in the superiority of their historical moment over others
6198509 only if your god can say things that outrage you and make you struggle as in a real friendship or marriage will you know that you have gotten hold of a real god and not a figment of your imagination so an authoritative bible is not the enemy of a personal relationship with god it is the precondition for it
6198510 i only know what ive read in the newspapers i dont believe that ive ever met her
6198511 i want to thank you for your support and thank you for partnering with me in moving new hampshire forward to a new energy future and in maintaining the character and the natural beauty of our great state
6198512 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6198513 yeah been through it its all good its great im really excited
6198514 americas defense line the justice departments battle to register the israel lobby as agents of a foreign government
6198515 the injury of the united states or to the advantage of a foreign country
6198516 in the early 1960s the attorney general found that the israel lobby was acting as an unregistered foreign agent for israel and ordered it to register nevertheless after a similar three year period of delays and appeals aipacs predecessor was allowed to file a secret foreign agents registration act fara statement our nations first exception to that very important public disclosure law forcing todays prosecutors to operate under a higher standard of evidence smacks of institutionalized preferential treatment for a lobby that has serially engaged in activities harmful to the united states
6198517 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6198518 if you are white you are alright if you are light step ahead and if you are black step back
6198519 i shouldnt have to choose i want to identity with every part of my identity
6198520 i am 1 4 indian 1 8 scots irish 1 8 italian 1 16 inuit 1 16 cuban and 1 4 black
6198521 but when i started looking into my files i had three tenants that had been here for 27 years
6198522 i was passing one day i went to a doctor downstairs
6198523 a lady sent them from europe i was shocked i couldnt believe it
6198524 even at night we sit out at the courtyard at baldwin plaza and watch the fireworks at harbor yard
6198525 i dont even have to take my car with the gas prices
6198526 i had open heart surgery and my medicines are right down there
6198527 when they hired me they just told me there were a few bad apples i didnt know what i was getting into
6198528 a lot of people who were doing this stuff had moved out because i was so strict or they were evicted
6198529 even though we get paid we just like the job i work here seven days a week even though they pay me for five days
6198530 if theres someone sick in the building i cook for them i make them soup if they need to go to the doctor i have my car and ill take them
6198531 if anything broke they come all you have to do is tell her and theyll be right there to fix it you cant beat this place
6198532 however you made an interesting point are the premium services people paying for the free loaders
6198533 but i believe people are frustrated about how washington does its business
6198534 people keep telling us over and over how much they are hurting
6198535 unemployment today is much higher than when i left office
6198536 even my republican friends are saying look washington isnt working
6198537 over the last six years we as a country have borrowed 4 trillion
6198538 weve been mortgaging our future to countries like china and india the reality is that we have to get a handle on the countrys economy the dollars value is at the lowest its been in our history
6198539 sen wicker is proud of his record of bringing federal dollars to mississipi helping to improve our infrastructure and get more and better paying jobs
6198540 hes worked in a bi partisan effort with sen cochran and the entire delegation to make sure mississippi gets its fair share of federal funding for transportation and water and sewer without sen wickers help desoto county would not have updated sewer
6198541 an earmark is when a congressman and senator can stick something in a bill and it never gets voted on
6198542 if a project is worthwhile it should stand on its own merits weve got to get fiscal responsibility back in government
6198543 all of the reporting shows it dealt with these folks intentions
6198544 relates to a navigation interface display system that graphically organizes content for display on a television
6198545 one who is able to work but wanders the streets in idleness or one leading an idle life who has no property sufficient for his support
6198546 i was a councilman for 32 years and mayor for eight in the early years we had big plans but when the elementary school burned in 1939 it really hurt we havent grown much since we have only about 600 people but most seem to be happy with our small peaceful community
6198547 id give up my season tickets if they would just let me keep my parking pass
6198548 however you made an interesting point are the premium services people paying for the free loaders
6198549 our goal is to keep animals out of the shelters
6198550 the people at the rescue groups spend so much time working with the animals they dont have the energy to think about how to keep them from coming into the system
6198551 we kept thinking perhaps theres something we can do to find out why people give up their pets and to help keep them in their original homes
6198552 these animals were part of the family and they felt terrible about it but they couldnt afford to buy pet food
6198553 we had clients in financial difficulty who would ask us if we had food for their dogs and cats
6198554 we found a supplier who would take all coupons including their competitors
6198555 i bought 400 worth of food the last time we went and paid 67
6198556 every month we give out somewhere between 100 and 150 bags
6198557 you see such joy on peoples faces when they hear youre going to feed their pets
6198558 well be interviewing clients who need rental assistance or help with their utility bills and when we start talking about their pets the attitudes immediately change all the barriers fall
6198559 im not ruling it out but right now were so swamped with our primary focus of feeding families we havent been able to put it in place anywhere else
6198560 but cfa isnt the only place we could do it
6198561 were thinking about meals on wheels programs and other senior services programs for example
6198562 we highlight the animals on our web site companionanimaladvocates org and they go directly from their original home into a new home not into a rescue foster home or a shelter

6198775 there are serious problems that must be addressed the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
6198776 oh im not pregnant i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch
6198777 we hebben vandaag tegen rusland duidelijk gemaakt dat we met vertrouwen naar de wk kwalificatieduels kunnen toeleven
6198778 dit beschouw ik als een goede eerste stap richting het wk van 2010 in zuid afrika ik ben vooral blij dat we ook tegen de sterke russen niet te veel mogelijkheden hebben weggegeven het stond goed zoals ze dat zeggen
6198779 we hadden vaker dan eenmaal moeten scoren maar al met al overheerst bij mij de tevredenheid de russen zijn heel gevaarlijk in de counter dat gevaar hebben we redelijk kunnen neutraliseren dat is knap
6198780 ik vond het terecht dat de scheidsrechter voor een strafschop floot
6198781 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6198782 judge tells ted stevens he cant move trial to friendly territory
6198783 with the kids its not often i get to hide in the bedroom for serious chats
6198784 it reveals the truth about how god is giving in his essence and the gift that he wants to give us sometimes is a person
6198785 our purpose is to deepen the understanding of the teaching so that it will be accepted by catholics and to make them better defenders of it
6198786 and certainly were trying to meet those who have rejected it to reconsider and hopefully to accept it
6198787 there was a big disappointment among a number of people
6198788 what we were left with was the concept that every sexual act must be open to conception and thats just not something that many young people can accept
6198789 it is most commonly an issue in the context of the marriage preparation course
6198790 most of the young generation was not involved with the intensity of the introduction of humanae vitae and it comes across as a new approach to our sexuality
6198791 i think people tend to think of contraception teachings as restrictive or oppressive when it is truly liberating to live as we were meant to live
6198792 natural family planning has been extremely effective weve practiced it on those occasions when we need to and our children have arrived as god has sent them
6198793 i was thunderstruck that his was the voice of the holy spirit and i thought how did paul vi know this
6198794 and so we gave up contraception in about 1985 and embarked upon this liberating empowering adventure
6198795 i remember walking out of there and deciding im going on the pill
6198796 i got the prescription but i went to fill it at j l hudsons the department store

6198800 what were hearing from trainers and physicians is were getting some back injuries when the ball carrier is immediately snapped to the ground by being jerked quickly
6198801 if the ball carrier is grabbed by the shoulder or jersey and just ridden to the ground over a couple of yards thats not going to be a foul
6198802 well err on the side of safety well defend the official who may be a little more strict because thats a major point of emphasis
6198803 this is a short dvd that focuses on proper injury prevention tackling techniques
6198804 its been distributed to every college in the nation and we encourage every football program to show this to the student athletes
6198805 if communicating is talking thats what we have been doing at practice as we go forward i dont know i dont foresee anything changing if it does its in his court
6198806 its a tough situation especially when you come into a working environment
6198807 but my job is to stay professional im going to do what im supposed to do
6198808 at the beginning of camp i hadnt asked for a trade
6198809 if im not going to be treated fairly if my hard work and loyalty isnt going to be rewarded here then let me go somewhere where its going to be rewarded thats how i feel
6198810 honestly i think it should be completely separated i think thats why we have a department that deals with that
6198811 i feel the exact same way about anquan he is a good football player the cardinals have extended his contract once tried to do it again and our intent is to do it the first chance we get
6198812 anybody that knows me that knows what kind of guy i am they know im a hard worker
6198813 im a guy that does the right things on and off the field im not worried about my reputation being tarnished for me telling the truth
6198814 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6198815 in court records and whose friends say she doesnt want to talk about the experience gay pride t shirts and rainbow colored clothing when they found out how davis had treated her and he questioned many of them about their sexuality and association with gay students some were suspended
6198816 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6198817 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words
6198818 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6198819 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6198820 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6198821 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6198822 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6198823 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6198824 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota

6198827 the federal government could actually embarrass the laggard states by naming the ones that cling to weak tests
6198828 i never got to take my test because the company that was sponsoring me had some issues going on
6198829 one day i showed up to work and my boss was being handcuffed and put in a car they kind of locked down the place
6198830 i figured that was the end of my life insurance career
6198831 ive got good news and bad news the good news is you scored higher on the test than everybody the bad news is my dad wants to meet you and bring your playbook
6198832 i always enjoyed learning why we did the things we did offensively i always asked why sometimes the coaches maybe misunderstood me i wasnt really questioning them as much as i was just wanting to learn
6198833 i had told my wife awhile back that if mark gets a head job id like to go because i think great things could happen
6198834 if thats the only thing you can find thats wrong with him thats not bad
6198835 some people have to yell and scream to get their point across
6198836 some people have to exhibit certain animation mark knows who he is people respect him because of that hes the head coach but he doesnt have to tell anybody
6198837 i was kind of coaching off of past experiences and even fumes sometimes i didnt study the game on an ongoing basis like i normally do
6198838 which he did a very good job of but it got lost in the translation
6198839 i was listening i still wasnt seeing it in my mind quickly enough to make a change or make a call i would watch games afterward and id just think i cant believe we went the whole game and i didnt call this or do that id just be upset with myself
6198840 in the locker room at halftime if somethings not going right we need to get yelled at he definitely does that i think it just serves as an example for a lot of people that you can be passionate about something and yet stay calm and keep your head on your shoulders and stay levelheaded

6198850 camp is going really well i feel great and everything is coming along right on schedule my sparring partners are earning every dime that were paying them
6198851 now that we are inside a month from the fight this is where i start to get nasty i wish i could fight every 30 days like i did earlier in my career i wish today was september 12th
6198852 guzman doesnt know what is going to happen to him
6198853 campbell loves to talk he likes to run his mouth about anything he can say whatever he wants because it doesnt change the fact that i will make him look foolish on sept 13
6198854 most fighters think they have me figured out simply by watching my recent fights campbell is no different he thinks he has the keys to victory watching film and actually fighting me are two completely different things if you thought i was fast and skilled on tape wait until you try to hit me inside the ring im a blur it wont happen
6198855 the weight wont be an issue because i have a great strength and conditioning coach in my corner david buer david is one of the best trainers in the country hes worked with a bunch of celebrities and world champion boxers
6198856 davids training regimen are some of the most detailed that i have ever seen
6198857 one of the goals of training camp was to adjust and maximize my speed and power to the lightweight division guys are bigger and stronger here so i needed to spice things up in the gym im confident that you will see the strongest fastest and best conditioned guzman ever on september 13
6198858 it wont affect me because were so close to the fight and im prepared to go 10 or more hard rounds
6198859 ive fought twice before on espn but in swing bouts not scheduled like this one its a big deal everybody watches espn friday night fights ive got a foot in the door but a win august 29th against davis will open more doors and help get my name out there nationally everybody hes davis lost to have been world champion fought for the world title or is contending to fight for a world title
6198860 davis started his pro career late when he was 29
6198861 sometimes a long amateur career takes a beating on a fighters body but so far davis has done well for his age 36 and obviously hes taken good care of his body some younger fighters have underestimated him thinking that due to his age hes slower than he really is im taking him seriously though preparing to fight him at his peak not thinking about his age at all

6198864 the maynard ferguson library represents the written music of one of the most amazing and long lived careers in jazz history
6198865 one of the most exciting aspects of this acquisition is that the one oclock and other ensembles will have the opportunity to perform the music and to keep fergusons legacy alive
6198866 as a member of maynards musical family it is doubly sweet for me to see this collection find a home here at unt over the years maynard hired many unt musicians in his bands and i know that he would be thrilled to see his music placed here and brought to life by our talented students on a regular basis
6198867 with the stan kenton library already in place here at unt it was a natural choice to include maynards book as well
6198868 stans band was where the music world first really got to hear maynard and i know he considered stan to be a mentor
6198869 im excited about having this music here and grateful for the gifts that made it possible
6198870 it will give all of us a chance to get to know these great charts better
6198871 was one of maynards favorite schools always delivering some of the best musicians
6198872 the ferguson family is thrilled to see maynards library being launched for a second career where others will have the opportunity to study experience and perform the charts that were the identity of maynard ferguson and continue the legacy of a man who brought tremendous joy to the world with his infectious power and passion for life
6198873 our jazz program is world renowned for its highly professional performance standards and for its cutting edge new music with the kenton collection and now the ferguson collection receiving the attention of our ensembles and researchers we look forward to being just as well known for our work in the preservation of artistic traditions such as those of kenton and ferguson having the original music here gives us the chance to maintain a special identity with these legends of the jazz world

6198875 we are pleased to report that our revenue in the second quarter was within our stated guidance gross margin in the second quarter of 2008 declined as compared to the first quarter of 2008 primarily due to lower capacity utilization in memory final testing and price erosion of dram business flash revenues declined 7 quarter over quarter and contributed to around 29 of our total revenue in q2 down from 32 in the previous quarter in a more positive light among our flash sector mask rom revenues were up 10 quarter over quarter and contributed to 7 of flash revenue mixed signal revenues were also up 11 quarter over quarter and contributed to 8 of our total revenue revenues from our lcd driver ic increased 3 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2008 reflecting a brief recovery in demand from our customers dram revenues remained relatively flat up 1 in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the previous quarter

6198877 the overall dram market visibility in following quarters remains limited we do not anticipate the recovery of our dram business due to weaker than expected pc demand we remain cautious on the lcd market due to weak seasonal demand however we still notice better demands from our customers in q4 as compared to q3 in addition gold bumping business will maintain its growth momentum in the second half due to new customer programs mask rom and mixed signal revenues should continue to grow with the increase in demands from customers considering the overall market situation among our product segments we currently expect that q3 revenue to be in the range of approximately us 149 million to us 159 million which is down 6 to flat as compared to q2 and gross margin to be in the range of 2 5 to 5 5 in the current down cycle we are strongly confident in our ability to maintain healthy operations and we plan to continue our disciplined capital expenditures and to strictly focus on cost savings and customer expansion

6199116 in future priorities should be given to uses what we call coastal dependent uses
6199117 uses that need to be by the sea and those uses that dont need to be by the sea should seriously be thinking about having them set back
6199118 governments have initiated quite detailed mapping of our coastline identifying areas that could be subject to inundation

6199124 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6199125 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6199126 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6199127 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6199128 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6199129 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6199130 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6199131 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6199132 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6199133 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6199134 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6199135 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6199136 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6199137 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6199144 i would advise that you contact your isp internet service provider about this matter please also note though that accessing the us itunes store outside of the geographic region of the united states is not supported and that attempting to access it while in china is at your own risk
6199145 this is the first of many stores we will open in china
6199146 angry netizens internet users are rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase they have also expressed a wish to ban the albums singers and producers most notably sting john mayer and dave matthews from entering china
6199147 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6199148 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6199149 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6199150 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6199154 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6199155 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

6199159 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6199160 in the face of certain doom humans elves and dwarves have forged an alliance of order
6199161 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6199162 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6199163 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6199164 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6199165 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6199166 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6199167 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6199168 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6199169 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6199170 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6199171 our projected value of each point is in excess of 1 900
6199172 it is unprecedented that claims can begin going out in an eight month period
6199173 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything

6199175 my microcontroller can beat the hell out of your microcontroller
6199176 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
6199177 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6199178 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6199179 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6199180 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6199181 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6199182 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6199183 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6199184 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6199185 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6199186 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6199187 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6199188 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6199189 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6199190 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6199191 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6199192 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6199193 first time that system builders will be able to build customized personalized laptops from
6199194 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6199195 this is continued evidence that the initiatives and programs to protect workers safety and health designed by and implemented in this administration are indeed working
6199196 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6199197 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6199198 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6199199 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6199200 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6199201 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6199202 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6199203 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6199204 who are open to doing something on the production side
6199205 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6199206 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6199207 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6199208 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6199209 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6199210 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6199211 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6199212 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6199213 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6199214 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6199215 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6199216 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6199217 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6199218 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6199219 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6199220 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6199221 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6199222 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6199223 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6199224 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6199225 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6199226 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6199227 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6199228 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6199235 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6199236 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6199237 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6199238 and if i dont cross the line in second i dont care if people are disqualified or not i didnt deserve the medal

6199240 im going to be like this medal was given to me
6199241 oh lord ok so theyre saying wallace spearmon stepped out and the second place guy stepped out well hopefully usain bolt stepped out too that means ill go home with the gold

6199249 today theyre looking at public property so it will be municipal buildings and equipment it will be roads culverts any of that that was damaged as a result of the storm
6199250 water is bad enough but combine it with mud and youve got a real problem
6199251 i can tell you right now that were discovering more damage as we go along its unfortunate that things are popping up all of the sudden that we never realized we were having trouble with
6199252 thats why its critical that the state and federal governments today view this devastation first hand and get an appreciation for the challenges that our municipalities face to recover from the storm
6199253 there are some really bad guys that we take off the street right away
6199254 we tell the others they can end up like this guy in jail or straighten up
6199255 the old fashion method of going out on the street and arresting as many people as you can that only works if you have a large number of jails
6199256 we have much to celebrate so please take pride in your accomplishments
6199257 its a tough job you deserve it its a tough job
6199258 sometimes we forget to celebrate accomplishments because we decide probably incorrectly that theyre not worth celebrating anymore
6199259 when you choose to take the time to celebrate even the smallest accomplishments you get a little dopamine release and its good for you
6199260 it was great to have everyone together and hear the motivational words from daeschner and metzger
6199261 but seeing all of the messages from the kids was the best theyre why were here and its good to be reminded of that
6199262 no child has failed no staff member has failed and most importantly no administrators have failed
6199263 we know these kids are the toughest we want to make them tough and smart
6199264 in history one of the courses could be on the culture of honor what protecting the tribe was about from the greeks to the samurai warrior
6199265 it is in how one understands the word discipline it is most associated with punishment and means painful stern and harsh laced with punishment that is not what the word means in our school
6199266 some call it tough love no yelling no posturing just common sense and the benefit of the doubt if they do not respond or do not like it they have the choice to go somewhere else and thrive we do not need every child only the ones who want a job in the first responder industry
6199267 the industry itself sets the pace we just teach the career survival skills necessary to be accepted for a job
6199268 at this point i think they need hillary clinton ive been thinking this way a long time not just because its bold and they need to show bold but you know what i think
6199269 you know im reading i guess the same thing youre reading that its between three boring white guys again
6199270 actually if he doubled down on colin powell how wild would that be i mean this is the democrats problem is that they never do anything bold once they get the nomination you know im still for obama but i have to tell you hes trying my patience
6199271 well moving to the center on so many issues and just doing what i saw kerry do what i saw al gore do i thought he was going to be different he didnt have that im going to blow it look on his face like those two did but hes doing sort of the same thing moving to the center moving to be a kind of a lighter version of the republican candidate
6199272 john thomson did not give his life for a goal he gave his life for an ideal the ideal for which every brave life ought to be willing to lay itself down loyalty to the trust placed in our hands
6199273 his death is a great loss to british football for no one has done more than john thomson to bring honour to the game there is one way in which his death might be great gain those thoughtless crowds who call themselves celtic or rangers followers whom both teams disown who gathered behind the goals of their respective favourites and cheer themselves hoarse when a member of the opposing team lies writhing in pain if they can be brought to realise by this tragic happening the brutal cruelty of their action john thomson will not have given his young life in vain
6199274 do they realise that their shameless jeering was the last sound that ever reached john thomson s dying brain
6199275 by chance it was a rangers crowd that howled with fiendish glee as that silent figure that had done such a splendid thing lay broken on the ground but if the rangers goalkeeper had been lying there as loud a roar would have risen from celtic throats
6199276 if the death of john thomson brings to an end this ghoulish gloating over fallen opponents his last brave action will have achieved far more than the saving of a critical goal

6199297 with my injury two years ago i never thought this was going to happen
6199298 in a routine international bout i got a thumb in the eye it pushed my eye back inside my head i had two fractures i had to be hospitalised for surgery

6199301 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
6199302 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
6199303 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6199304 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
6199305 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
6199306 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
6199307 all that i can say is that i wish my days were blessed with more words that could leave me feeling like i feel right now after reading that
6199308 a group of machete wielding militiamen attacked a girls school in the middle of the night the teenagers were rousted from their beds about 2 00 am and forced to line up in the dining hall they were ordered to separate themselves hutu from tutsi so that only the tutsi would die
6199309 we cannot separate ourselves you see because we are not hutu we are not tutsi we are rwandan
6199310 but what a legacy they leave we are not hutu we are not tutsi we are rwandan in that simple sentiment that young girl bespoke a graciousness upon which depends the salvation of the world

6199312 deep tensions between civil and religious understandings of that institution
6199313 the religious orthodoxy of some sects concerning who may marry
6199314 same sex marriages were recognized by the christian church in the fifth century were observed among natives by the first spanish explorers in the americas were common among the mojave indians of the colorado river in southeastern california and have been documented in more than 230 african tribes
6199315 by sanctioning only marriages between a man and a woman the state relegates the beliefs and practices of these religions denominations and clergy to second class status
6199316 free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference
6199317 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6199318 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6199319 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6199320 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it
6199321 i tend to go back to certain races each year to gauge my level of fitness
6199322 at wetherby in 2007 i came sixth with an overall time of two hours eight minutes this year in much worse conditions i came third in two hours three minutes
6199323 typically in the past id take around 25 minutes for a 1500 metre swim ive shaved at least two minutes off that this year
6199324 its the best job i could be doing i get to train every day while other people are at work and i can keep a close eye on my diet too
6199325 i live nine miles from the fire station so i run or bike in every day
6199326 theres no doubt that kerrys protein supplements have made all the difference this year
6199327 my performance has improved and im really enjoying competing theyre very easy to drink too absolutely spot on
6199328 the fiercely partisan religious right leader rick warren of four years ago is little different from the rick warren of today
6199329 at the civic forum warren featured the key litmus tests of the religious right abortion and same sex marriage while ignoring the so called broader agenda of the supposedly newly moderate evangelicals such as climate change and domestic and world poverty
6199330 warren opened the forum by saying he supports separation of church and state while the event itself held in the sanctuary of a church epitomized the all out war on separation being waged by the religious right and its current avuncular leader mccain and obama have contributed greatly to the role of warren as a power broker reflecting poorly on the judgment of both

6199370 have adequately alleged that a reasonable investor would have considered the undisclosed information material in making investment decisions
6199371 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive you have something like this happen it could have been marilyn manson it could have been any number of people who make art that is startling visually on the darker side it couldve been pat boone for christs sake at the end of the day there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that theyre fucked up and lost and all we can do is try to learn from it

6199389 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6199390 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6199398 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6199399 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6199400 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6199401 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6199402 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6199403 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6199404 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6199405 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6199406 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6199407 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6199408 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6199409 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6199410 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6199411 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6199412 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6199413 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6199414 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6199415 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6199416 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6199417 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6199418 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6199419 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6199420 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6199421 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
6199422 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
6199423 the spider armor is the spider man equivalent of empty calories its totally a guilty pleasure and yes we know it makes no sense for a character centered on speed and agility to be weighed down by a bulky metal costume but so shiny the armor didnt stick around longer than one specifically targeted adventure so we can forgive its impracticality and merely bask in its wonderful excess
6199424 youve got this alien parasite that acts as a substitute for everything you wear so what do you do when mr
6199425 theres a reason ricochet remains semi active in the marvel universe as one of the loners while his slingers teammates toil mostly in obscurity or death well there are a few reasons but his rad costume is certainly one of them the three quarter face mask that covers facial features while letting the costumes wearers hair to fly free provides a unique and modern look while the leather jacket adorned with throwing discs makes for a nice functional addition when the slingers pilfered wardrobe johnny gallo struck the jackpot while dusk got caught swinging
6199426 a new take on an old classic ben reilly did a little revamp on peter parkers iconic costume before hitting the streets as spider man he added a bigger spider did a little rearranging of the ol red and blue and tossed the web shooters on the outside all this together gave a fresh new look to everyones friendly neighborhood web swinger while still preserving the spirit of the original get up and if you like this costume you should check out amazing that they say about fashion going in cycles
6199427 when peter parker still had dibs on the spider man identity but ben reilly wanted to do some webswinging of his own the scarlet spider was born with some new colors and a hoodie over the classic super hero spandex ben took his design to the streets and dont forget the bold move of un centering his spider symbol a definite super fashion risk short lived though it may have been the scarlet spider duds still stand as a bold take on the iconic costume
6199428 a new body deserves a new costume or at least that was tony starks idea after peter parker came back from the dead following the other swapping out trademark red and blue for iron mans own red and gold stark brought spidey into the 21st century with bullet proofing glide functionality and a stealth mode not to mention that butt kicking button throw in three mechanical arms doc ock would be envious of and youve got a very different kind of spidey with a world of possibilities before him
6199429 its sleek its sexy and originally it was alien spideys black suit took the simple approach slapping a big white spider across the back and chest and calling it a costume bringing with it an attitude and a coolness all its own this suit not only drove the ladies nuts but also helped to hide those extra pounds put on from eating too many of aunt mays muffins a fan favorite to this day you cant help but be impressed by a costume so awesome it became its own character
6199430 theres no doubting that spideys classic costume is at the pinnacle of super hero fashion despite alien redesigns tony stark upgrades and a slew of variant editions spider man always seems to find his way back into his old duds at this point the costume has reached an iconic level and to think peter parker sewed it together when he was only 15 who says home ec class is for losers the only question that remains then is webbed armpits or no webbed armpits
6199431 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6199432 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6199433 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6199434 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6199435 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6199436 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6199437 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6199438 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6199439 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6199440 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6199441 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6199442 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6199443 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6199444 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

6199469 i predicted new orleans would come back as a stronger and better city we helped deliver 126 billion in taxpayer money
6199470 who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say new orleans la
6199471 i think the message here today is hope is being restored hope is coming back
6199472 eww thats so nasty come on i have really good taste
6199473 everyone who knows me knows i can be a jokester but i guess i took it too far i never meant to say anything rude about michael i am 100 percent sorry for what i said i take full responsibility for it
6199474 when we are sitting in the stands we are very grateful that michael swims for the u s its cool to be a part of the team on which michael won eight gold medals we know each other and michael is like my little brother he jokes around me all the time and its all good natured but obviously people who dont know me can take it the wrong way
6199475 hes been here at the olympics hes always with me hes totally fine with the rumors this is just the way things go sometimes but to michael i am so sorry for the things i said
6199476 its still great im sick of people crying shark jumping too soon
6199477 its so dark and hip and cool and totally warped man
6199478 its silly offensive crap garbage thats a wicked guilty pleasure

6199484 i cant believe jessica walter agreed to be on it though hows that arrested development movie coming along anyway
6199485 there is too much of this reality stuff i am so tired of this
6199486 i agree care for a refresher on that tom collins
6199487 its so bitchy and trashy and fun tyras fierce in a hilarious way
6199488 this is the worst television show ever made tyra banks is a monster my face hurts oh but hows that tranny doing

6199493 one of my real beliefs in this work is that in addition to adopting animals out and protecting animals from cruelty its important to have programs that bring people and animals together in meaningful ways
6199494 people are in my office all day when shes here
6199495 it has a calming effect i look forward to coming here every week and seeing the dogs

6199503 we are very excited to let gamers get their hands on fallout 3 the latest chapter in this beloved and highly acclaimed franchise
6199504 to meet the huge demand for this title by our fans worldwide we are planning one of the biggest launches of any game released this year
6199505 with kaz matsui out and ty wigginton playing a lot of left field it made sense for us to add another experienced infielder
6199506 i was ahead in the count and that shouldnt have happened
6199507 but the way i look at it is you work those type of innings in that sort of game situation now and when i get in for a save i will have let those bad ones go
6199508 having that dl time refreshed my throwing arm which is kind of nice after having the problem
6199509 but down the stretch i just have to keep getting my innings and stay right where i am and ill be fine
6199510 thats always the other end of an injury get a little rest and gear up
6199511 he does look strong and thats a good thing because we need him strong the trip to the dl might be something that in a strange way it may be a benefit
6199512 its about staying on top of conditioning not shutting it down halfway through
6199513 in the first half i was in the gym four days per week and in the second half im in three days per week to maintain
6199514 bobby has been through the wars and knows how long the season is

6199516 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
6199517 if there were a sentence forever i would certainly give it to you
6199518 thank you for looking at me because i want you to know the pain you have caused me
6199519 you did a very bad and stupid thing if you have tried to cause pain and anguish you have definitely succeeded
6199520 because of your selfishness you have bestowed this terrible nightmare upon us and it will never end
6199521 in future priorities should be given to uses what we call coastal dependent uses
6199522 uses that need to be by the sea and those uses that dont need to be by the sea should seriously be thinking about having them set back
6199523 governments have initiated quite detailed mapping of our coastline identifying areas that could be subject to inundation
6199524 right now were going to go through the details of the decision before making further comment
6199525 programming dedicated primarily to the coverage and celebration of canadian athletes with a particular emphasis on amateur athletes
6199526 its a bit of a compromise and i think its not unreasonable
6199527 i think its a win win cbcs going be able to do what they said they want to do which is celebrate amateur sports and canadian athletes and athletics and not basically just be a second network for cbc to run live sporting events all day long
6199528 expects the cbc to abide by its commitment to broadcast 80 per cent canadian content in each broadcast year

6199536 if downstream brokerages deliberately stuck their heads in the sand but continued to actively market these products to unknowing investors that will certainly be relevant to our calculus of the firms culpability
6199537 these firms are licenses broker dealers and were obviously well paid by their clients for their specialized knowledge and diligence regarding the appropriateness of various products as investments
6199538 will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists

6199553 when she got in that car she could have just kept going and not come back in that store to take my nieces life
6199554 plausibly alleged that bristol myers silence with regard to the details of the apotex settlement made its public statements misleading or false
6199555 have adequately alleged that a reasonable investor would have considered the undisclosed information material in making investment decisions
6199556 that prevented states and local governments from imposing stricter monitoring of pollution generated by power plants factories and oil refineries than required by the federal government
6199557 the question in this case is whether permitting authorities may supplement inadequate monitoring requirements when epa has taken no action
6199558 in regard to this report we of course had more expectations from the agency
6199559 the trend of cooperation should continue in a way that as dr larijani pointed out the parliament and the islamic republic of iran would not be compelled to review the going trend of the cooperation and adopt new limitations

6199567 even though they were coming from very different places they all looked very similar to one another
6199568 the texture and shades a cobalt blue red fibers that are almost a magenta color are very very similar
6199569 we were able to reach in with a tweezers and pick it up
6199570 but i dont have the foggiest idea what they are

6199574 i realized that while two people from two entirely different countries and backgrounds may seem to have nothing in common the only thing they might have in common is me
6199575 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6199576 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6199577 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6199578 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6199579 now is a terrific time for renewables to launch i hope they get all the capital they need and all the great minds and talent but i dont want it to come at the expense of the oil and gas industry
6199580 as goes colorado so goes the west as far as this energy policy debate
6199581 the future in colorado is building wind farms in wheat fields
6199582 quite frankly its how we should have been thinking for 10 years
6199583 these sites provide a record for the future about the workings of the government in this day and time
6199584 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
6199585 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents
6199586 the majority of information is actually made available through these web sites but they are changing very rapidly as new information is introduced and especially as administration changes occur
6199587 when bush took over the second that he was sworn in the white house web site went from being this massive collection of important links to a picture of bush and his biography and a picture of vice president cheney and his biography
6199588 we dont want to see that happen again its just very important for historys sake that this material is archived the way that the printed material has always been archived
6199589 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
6199590 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6199591 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavor
6199592 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavor of the resulting oils
6199593 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants
6199594 a notable strength of this manuscript is the combined use of structural and evolutionary biology to draw new insights regarding enzyme function these insights led to the striking demonstration that a single amino acid substitution converts one enzyme into another thereby showing how a single point mutation can contribute to the evolution of different biosynthetic pathways this begins to answer the long standing question as to how the same starting molecule can be converted into different products by enzymes that look strikingly similar
6199595 we have discovered that they are also present in marine animals such as sea anemone and corals however we do not know what they do in these organisms
6199596 structural insights into the evolutionary paths of oxylipin biosynthetic enzymes

6199685 much of our success this quarter can be attributed to our three pronged revenue maximization strategy in which we actively monitor occupancy adjust price and apply suite specific incentives
6199686 in the first quarter of 2008 we strategically reduced market rents on select properties in response to weaker seasonal demand and quickly realized an increase in occupancy
6199687 in the second quarter this strategy continued to be very successful with occupancy improving overall in alberta where it holds 54 per cent of its inventory saskatchewan british columbia and quebec

6199689 wed rather have occupancy and wed rather have the bottom line consumers are very price sensitive and thats why were very sensitive with our prices and our rates we want to continue to attract and retain residents through this more competitive market were seeing because of the housing market

6199849 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
6199850 he discovered that it was something that hadnt been described before
6199851 han hedder rune inde p anarcho foraet anarkistisk debatforum red og det nummer han ringede fra var 33428000 danmarks journalistforbund
6199852 why do we have such a hard time hearing good news from baghdad
6199853 der findes ingen entydig profil p personer der radikaliseres og efterf lgende rekrutteres til terrorisme
6199854 der har i de senere r v ret stadig flere episoder med konfrontationer mellem personer og grupperinger fra henholdsvis det h jre og det venstreekstremistiske milj i de fleste tilf lde har der v ret tale om aktioner herunder af voldelig karakter fra det venstreekstremistiske milj rettet mod de arrangementer demonstrationer m der mv som personer og grupperinger fra det h jreekstremistiske milj har afholdt der er imidlertid ogs konstateret eksempler p at h jreekstremister har st et bag voldelige aktiviteter rettet mod venstreekstremister det er pets vurdering at der i venstre og h jreekstremistiske milj er er et get fokus p s danne voldelige aktiviteter mens antallet af voldsepisoder fortsat er relativt f er det pets vurdering at der er risiko for at konfrontationerne kan eskalere pet har i den forbindelse konstateret en get aktivitet i h jre og venstreekstremistiske milj er med henblik p at anskaffe v ben som led i den gensidige voldsud velse inddrages disse v ben i konfrontationerne vil det medf re en betydelig eskalering af konfrontationernes voldsomhed
6199855 der har i de senere r v ret et stigende fokus p trusler og chikane mod politikere og andre offentlige personer risikoen for at blive udsat
6199856 pet har siden efter ret 1992 modtaget indberetning fra politikredsene om kriminelle forhold og h ndelser
6199857 efter 11 september blev der sagt nogle meget rabiate ting fra dansk folkepartis side og der registrerede man ogs den st rste b lge af racistisk vold
6199858 so you dont feel like you were price gouging in any way
6199859 no no no i dont do that because cause always got cheap gas here why would i do that
6199860 the chinese authorities have informed us that they have refused paul gadd entry into hong kong
6199861 its a matter for the chinese authorities what happens next
6199862 take into consideration all relevant factors and circumstances when processing applications
6199863 one of the alarming things about this case is through our investigation we also learned mr johnson babysat for numerous families
6199864 i dont believe he should be accountable for everything because other kids that do have a proper brain arent being brought forward right now
6199865 yeah he runs with the young ones like i said thats what his mentality is there arent too many people his age he can associate with
6199866 about the set lists its a process of trial amp error mostly error we actually had some time to rehearse a couple of songs were never played live before and were gonna do these now on this tour most of the songs will however be a nice mixture of old and new favorites some to which you can dance and some to which you cant we tried hard to bring this tour to hawaii but not hard enough i think i sent a request to have all off days in either hawaii or las vegas but neither seems to be possible this time so wed probably end up staying on the bus in front of a wal mart somewhere speaking of wal mart our shopping lists include socks chivas regal 12 years old frank zappa cds cowboy boots marlboro lights ice more chivas and new zippo lighters i sincerely believe our finnish super livers will survive many more tours than this one so no liver transplants will be necessary conan obrien should still fear having us show up in his studio audience because we will prevail eventually were bound to succeed according to the great prophecies of reverend lance what would be greater than appearing on his first show when he replaces jay leno well keep the rest of the plan a secret
6199867 oh by the way i do tend to ramble with answers
6199868 sometimes i wonder if im just completely draining the sense out of everything
6199869 the first language he learned was sign and therefore his ability to listen to people with his eyes as well as his ears is incredible
6199870 i know a lot of tickets are sold in order to have a look at daniels body
6199871 in its most vulgar and displeasing to look at form and its suicide as a lifestyle
6199872 you have chosen to be a liability to yourself your family your neighborhood and this country
6199873 it all comes back to the horror the soullessness of a trend in america that is the abandonment of parenting
6199874 jeffs promotions guy richard mace has created another stunning and imaginative cover for jeff scott sotos new solo album incorporating the theme of global destruction and the decay of humanity this cover exemplifies the paradox of the beautiful mess that is jeffs own career as enjoyable as it has been he has indeed had his share of highs and lows and continues to pursue with determination and relish his own personal dream and ambition
6199875 so yes weve commenced filling in the final blanks of what is to be the second album dotting the is and crossing the ts so to speak
6199876 my top schools where i want to apply to are oxford and the sorbonne tanoreen
6199877 yeah we all have our not so hot stories performance space 122

6199880 we strongly hope that benedict xvi will make a trip to china
6199881 relations with the vatican are constantly improving we can say that there are big developments
6199882 hideous murders that many people believe were committed by mr simpson
6199883 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6199884 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6199885 one of reasons we created babyfirsttv is that we thought there was no good programming for babies on tv and according to the research that is out there most of the babies are watching tv anyway
6199886 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6199887 we are trying to bring the agreement to a close it is not done yet
6199888 yes sure im watching at night when i have the time
6199889 but he watches during the day and tells me all the latest news
6199890 its the 100th day after his death today and the whole family is still overwhelmed
6199891 to us nothing is interesting and nothing will ever be fun again
6199892 of course im watching its chinas games why shouldnt we watch
6199893 people have to make a living we cant just sit around all day
6199894 ive got a factory job during the day and a peach orchard to tend every evening
6199895 its peach picking season right now so there are so many things to do sure i watched the olympics opening ceremony and i care about how many gold medals china wins but frankly i have no energy for the games
6199896 we sell this to the candy makers and get a good price for this
6199897 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6199898 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states
6199899 so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6199900 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6199901 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6199902 ferocious asphyxiating sheets of warped two dimensional gameboy glitches and bruising drum bombast pierce the skull with sheer shrill force burrowing deep into the brain like a fever
6199903 we are very close kilinochchi is not very far from our sight
6199904 you really have to appreciate what the services are doing at the moment
6199905 they are doing a great job a great job i would say even though there are ups and downs the achievements are great
6199906 they did not have defenses in that area so they could not prepare themselves to face the military threat
6199907 theres some more to go other areas to get kilinochchi mullaitivu
6199908 the troops are confident the soldiers are confident the army commander is confident
6199909 this silence is not good for the troops at all
6199910 sooner or later we have to go for a negotiated settlement
6199911 women who have abortions have no greater risk of mental health problems than if they carry the pregnancy to term
6199912 comes very close to embracing the full reproductive health agenda
6199913 been consistently advocated by the pro choice progressive womens movement
6199914 loose coalition of progressive evangelicals and catholics held a press event to toot their own horn
6199915 not only is the new platform stronger in its support for the right to choose abortion it embraces the concept of reproductive justice including not only family planning but comprehensive sexuality education
6199916 it became clear that other than vague support for women who choose to continue pregnancies and caring adoption laws there was next to nothing in the plank these folks supported
6199917 certain that the quiet experienced voices of pro choice leaders carried far more weight than democrats and fellow travelers who oppose a womans right to decide whether abortion or childbearing and rearing is the best moral decision they can make
6199918 californias anti choice groups have put forth what has become a traditional anti choice attack a parental notification measure that is designed to chip away at access to abortion
6199919 again attempting an outright abortion ban a measure that is designed to challenge roe v wade in the supreme court
6199920 vote on a new extreme measure that would define a persons life as beginning at fertilization outlawing not just abortions but also emergency contraception and birth control
6199921 altogether the three bans represent a multi pronged attack on choice appearing on the ballot this november while in 2006 all eyes were on south dakota this fall reproductive rights activists have three states to watch
6199922 in recent weeks ricky martin became a proud father by the birth of twin sons
6199923 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6199924 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6199925 its a fact that a spell checker will not catch all the mistakes on your text so how do you solve this problem proofreading of coarse
6199926 its very important to the regents that he can be accepted by a broad consensus of the various baylor constituents and its very clear that whatever part of the baylor family one might talk with theyre pretty unanimous about one thing and thats that david garlands a fine fellow that can lead baylor during a time of transition
6199927 strong earnings guidance from hewlett packard after the close last night appear to have reinvigorated the bulls despite relatively uninspiring quarterly reports elsewhere on the street
6199928 without question there are two distinct approaches on display by mccain and obama
6199929 to their credit both recognize that no single element of reform is going to save the day instead the platform of each contains a number of reform proposals operating on a number of different fronts both recognize the need to control costs to address the problem of the uninsured and to improve the quality of delivery yet mccains proposals on the whole are striving for a system characterized by more competition more choice and more freedom while obamas tend toward greater government intervention
6199930 people need to be encouraged to consume just the amount of healthcare they really need or can personally afford and not any more
6199931 this is what we naturally do in every other area of our lives this can only be accomplished by returning responsibility for payment directly to the consumer not routing it through a third party be that an employer or a government mccains plan moves us in this direction therefore i believe it to be the most economically realistic over the long term
6199932 the commodity based approach to health care is fundamentally flawed
6199933 it restricts access to health care to those who can afford to buy it and assumes that prices will be reasonable because supply and demand are linked with most products consumers limit their demand based on price but in the case of health care demand is not price sensitive when you are sick you dont have a choice
6199934 where people cannot afford the health care they need that is where other institutions families communities churches and sometimes government will need to intervene
6199935 its no accident that many hospitals bear names reflecting their current or former religious affiliation
6199936 some people on the margins of society will simply never be able to afford the level of health care that they need
6199937 i think no 1 that people in the church and churches in general and at a local level is what im talking about have to care about these issues and see them as fundamentally issues of faith historically the church has done that
6199938 this is fundamentally a theological idea so the first step is to say that the body matters that god breathed the breath of life and the spirit into a human body as christians we believe in the resurrection of the body jesus in our eucharistic settings its all about a physical body and blood that we are partaking of so first weve got to cross this line to say we care about that stuff
6199939 if youve got to have fried chicken to draw a crowd theres something wrong with your message
6199940 the politics of it is brutal and poor people have very little power in this mix and somebody has to foot the bill health care in america is very expensive and when people start figuring out who pays for all of this that for me is when the rubber hits the road
6199941 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6199942 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6199943 many people began talking about it maybe being an honest manufacturing error
6199944 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
6199945 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
6199946 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6199947 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
6199948 damascus is moscows long standing partner in military cooperation and we are expecting to reach an agreement in principle on new weapons deals
6199949 the significant military assistance provided by israel to georgia in its war against russia will affect in the future and probably in the near future ties between russia and israel and russias attitude toward arab states
6199950 russia will re examine its ties with israel and it is not unlikely that moscow will now decide to increase its military assistance to arab countries in conflict with israel including syria
6199951 la esencia de educaci n es mirar al pa s en 20 a os m nimo
6199952 encuentro muy importante que el pa s discuta sobre educaci n pero creo que no estamos discutiendo de educaci n y no estamos discutiendo nada qu cambios vamos a hacer y c mo los vamos a hacer
6199953 la esencia de educaci n es mirar al pa s en 20 a os m nimo y esto la lge es ver c mo repartimos cierta institucionalidad
6199954 personalmente pienso que la educaci n no se trata de ense ar contenidos se acab esa etapa porque la mataron
6199955 si nos ponemos en serio a pensar tres problemas del pa s la productividad y c mo vamos a ser competitivos la convivencia y como esas personas van a enfrentar un mundo que va a ser tan distinto y c mo le buscamos sentido a la vida en un mundo tr gico esas tres cosas no las tocamos ni las hablamos y partimos de la base que hay contenidos que ense ar platas que dar y eso es absolutamente obsoleto donde veo en el mundo eso no est y mi voto en contra es para decir yo no quiero ser socio en discutir el 5 y llamarlo ley general

6199958 for some of our firms the third quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of reported losses clearly an unprecedented streak
6199959 you know youve hit a bottom when stocks go up on bad news
6199960 there is real belief that the u s economy is working its way through its problems
6199961 financials were oversold so they were due to pick up a bounce
6199962 theres still more volatility to come but they cant get much much worse than they already are
6199963 theres an ongoing fear factor about the credit crunch that continues to drag down some financials
6199964 people are going to be looking at the gas numbers
6199965 just as the market overshot to the upside it overshot the other way
6199966 i think credit markets need to improve in the u s before we see a sustained rally in the dollar
6199967 we may have hit a top for the dollar i dont think this rally can last
6199968 didnt eminem say something about you sucking off 50 cent
6199969 isnt there a song where eminem said you were on your knees sucking off 50
6199970 genocide like the international criminal court claims is non existent
