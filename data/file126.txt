1260007 o directamente mandarles a la mierda pero creo q lo dicho no voy a hacer ninguna de las dos cosas
1260008 you dont want anybody to get struck by lightning and playing in dangerous positions tip your caps to the umpires for giving us every opportunity to play through it came to the point where you couldnt get any more innings in
1260009 it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a zip lock bag full of water and opened it up
1260010 we had a chance to get back on the field and thats our job this time of year especially our job is to get the game in and thats what we tried to do
1260011 the lightning in my opinion even though it lit up the skies it was deep and away from the ballpark
1260012 i had talked to the groundskeeper several times about the weather and he said there were possible storms coming in i was concerned about the lightning
1260013 when that last one hit with one out in the bottom of the eighth it was too close even for us and i pulled them off
1260014 i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way but that lightning even though the booms are big it was deep and didnt affect anything the last one hit and there was no way i was going to keep them there and then of course the storms hit
1260015 some scary stuff can happen mother nature shes a tough lady
1260016 you dont want to mess with her and get on her bad side
1260017 weve got to be out of there but if you give those fans a reason to hang around they will tonight was a night they needed to be discouraged from being outside in those kind of conditions
1260018 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1260019 you have to be an idiot to stand outside in a lightning storm that to me is common sense and theres no reason to put anybody in harms way needlessly
1260020 we have no control over it once the first pitch starts
1260021 if we would have been ahead 2 0 i firmly believe that wally would have done the same thing absolutely because you need to try to play these games out as much as you can
1260022 he did that and was fair and at the same time when it got bad at the end no question he got everybody off the field i dont think any thought was given to waiting it out any longer than he had to make the call but he handled himself in a first class manner
1260023 i dont want to put it all on the umpires
1260024 theyve got a job to do theyre under pressure from mlb they want to get these games in if mlb reviews the situation and decides they didnt do everything in their power to get a game in then they could get in trouble
1260025 i just think a decision probably should have been made collectively during the first delay when you had tornado warnings all over the area when youve got lightning all over the area when youve got that kind of severe weather it makes sense to use any sort of window or lull to restart the game and let fans get out of here
1260026 our job is to get the games in and this time of year with the playoffs and teams in contention we know its tough
1260027 i dont really want to be here at midnight but thats our job thats what you do when the second rain came it just wasnt going to happen we talked to everybody and then called the game
1260028 he was one of the greatest journalists i have ever known and when i appointed him as baseball historian i didnt realize how unique he really was and i had known him a long time
1260029 he was just extraordinary he was absolutely extraordinary in every way and he had a depth of knowledge of the sport that no one else had he was truly a great historian and a wonderful human being so i am very grateful for all the advice he gave me and the council that he gave me
1260030 he told me youre too accessible you shouldnt talk to the media as much as you do you need to only talk when you have something to say
1260031 he was someone i could always turn to for advice
1260032 he had so many contacts so many friends that there were no secrets he found everything out but he never betrayed anybody never gave anybody away
1260033 he wanted to be a baseball writer and i think when he made up his mind that thats the only thing he wanted to do he just figured ill be the best one i can be
1260034 you read his byline and you dont realize how hard he worked hed come to the game hed go to the umpires room and talk to umpires he called owners during games he went up to players and talked to them and then went into the coachs room he just really worked hard
1260035 to go up against jerome holtzman the first day on the job i told my wife before i left that i dont know if i can do this
1260036 i dont know if ill last the spring since it was only spring training
1260037 he taught me everything he taught me how to get around and he introduced me to people he taught me what writing a story was like he taught me the important things of baseball compared to other sports its just so many things and yet there are a lot of things too that werent necessarily baseball related he was a great companion and not just a competitor
1260038 there will not be a lot more jerome holtzmans coming down the pike

1260042 belajar dan mendapat informasi di dalam kuliah sahaja tidak mencukupi jika pelajar tidak merasai dan mengutip pengalaman itu sendiri menerusi program sebegini ia dapat melatih pelajar supaya berdikari dan bersedia dengan segala kemungkinan yang bakal dihadapi ketika bekerja kelak
1260043 justeru bagi mendapatkan pengalaman tersebut suasana kaunter pendaftaran kolej telah diubah dan dihias seperti kafe lobi hotel dan resort yang sebenar dari hiasan meja hinggalah penyediaan makanan dan minuman semuanya berkonsepkan ala hotel

1260074 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1260075 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1260076 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1260077 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1260078 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1260079 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1260080 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1260081 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1260082 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1260083 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1260084 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1260085 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1260086 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1260087 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1260088 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1260089 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

1260098 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1260099 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1260100 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1260101 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1260112 these parts are fit for settling with ponds of good water woods that afford materials for building of small vessels and several veins of coal and alabaster salmon which is here so abundant and lands good for agriculture
1260113 the thing i like about this challenge is it attracts a whole range of cyclists guys who drive like bats out of hell and others who take more time to enjoy the scenery and both result in very effective physical benefits
1260114 whether fast or slow off road cycling certainly takes a level of fitness that not everyone can do
1260115 improve the lives of all people and the environment by promoting the bicycle as a mode of transportation and recreation
1260116 it doesnt do any good to say stay active and then tell a biker to go out and they go on a road like kings road and theyre terrified to ever bike again
1260117 the answer is not to say stay more active but you build cycle paths and make it so easy for everyone that it becomes natural and incorporated into daily life i think quebec is providing a great example in canada of what provinces need to do make cycling attractive easy and safe
1260118 all theyre doing is counting on the harbour being big enough to dilute what theyre putting out and the tides change it
1260119 theyre telling people the harbour is safe to swim in in my opinion its not
1260120 weve been waiting for this since the 1960s and they just put in the bare minimum
1260121 canada has a sad history of treating our oceans like our toilet
1260122 secondary sewage treatment is the minimum required in the united states by federal regulations its generally the minimum required in europe and thats been the case in those places for over 15 years
1260123 if we had waited our costs probably would have doubled or more so as well
1260124 we did what we could with what we had and i think we should be proud of that
1260125 i think its a great way to bring halifax and dartmouth together

1260138 i think we were visionary to ensure we had the capacity to change over to secondary treatment when the time came
1260139 when we approved the project years ago we designed them to be able to accommodate secondary treatment
1260140 with the engineering elements in place we can now go secondary with a module add on
1260141 its always cheaper to do something now than to do that same thing in the future were only making it more expensive for ourselves and increasing the risk to the environment in the meantime
1260142 were asking them to bring the resources with them for that change
1260143 we looked at it and then went back to the old one as its familiar

1260173 how much do you spend when you come to visit us

1260185 we did what we could with what we had and i think we should be proud of that
1260186 we have had to do this in the past but it will not continue as shore front property is being bought up and developed more and more each year
1260187 without it we could not consider hosting regattas and championships as we are currently doing should mr tanner sell that property or prevent us in any way from using his beach it would be a crippling blow to our learn to sail program and that in turn would substantially change the lyc in a very negative way
1260188 really this earthquake is nothing its just a garden variety quake that shakes things off shelves and is a little bit scary to people near the center
1260189 the important thing that it does is to gain attention for the huge usgs led quake scenario that is going on from now until november
1260190 it simply reminds people that quakes occur where they are expected to occur and they occur with no warning this quake was a nothing but the next magnitude 7 quake will also occur where it is expected to such as in southern california and it too will occur with no warning
1260191 if it were not already clear that earthquakes are a significant long term problem in los angeles county this number certainly makes that point
1260192 they certainly moved a lot of stuff in their day
1260193 splendid and one can well understand the reason that their business has grown 7 000 per cent in a decade
1260194 a growth so wonderful so phenomenal must be the result of undoubted merit
1260195 its the only thing im aware of that we can tell our grandchildren was made in bridgewater
1260196 its what i call the new gst the green shift tax
1260197 the impact of this permanent new carbon tax should be well understood by people

1260199 if prime minister stephen harper wants one bad enough well have an election
1260200 there are a thousand tricks he can use to prevent us being able to vote on a confidence motion
1260201 its like the prime minister said fish or cut bait if they want to force an election well be ready

1260208 its what i call the new gst the green shift tax
1260209 the impact of this permanent new carbon tax should be well understood by people
1260210 when you dont have any ideas yourself you attack the other people with the ideas
1260211 if prime minister stephen harper wants one bad enough well have an election
1260212 there are a thousand tricks he can use to prevent us being able to vote on a confidence motion
1260213 its like the prime minister said fish or cut bait if they want to force an election well be ready
1260214 she was here for a while and she seemed fine and then i noticed that she wasnt around anymore
1260215 peninsula community council only meets once a month anyway and we dont typically meet in the summertime at all
1260216 honestly there is no such thing as sanctioning a party president etc sanctions affect the people more so than the upper crust and is a tool used in hopes that the people will completely turn on the regime dirty international politics 101
1260217 the failure of the palestinian leadership to recognize israel to renounce violence and to get serious about negotiating peace and security for the region
1260218 throughout my entire life there has been injustice and repression in cuba never in my lifetime have the people of cuba known freedom never in the lives of two generations of cubans have the people of cuba known democracy i wont stand for this injustice i will maintain the embargo
1260219 foreign policy and obama some times i wonder my opinion from may 29th
1260220 i need to start saving now or else he wont be able to afford to go to school
1260221 tuition prices are going to be so high ill probably have to take out a second mortgage on the house to let him go
1260222 so even though people arent using that savings program its not impeding our students from going to university here
1260223 when you have a new baby youre not thinking about university or college at that point in time
1260224 youre thinking about all the priorities of having a new child and 18 years feels like youve got a lot of time to deal with this and so you put it off and you put it off and before you know it your child is heading off to university or college and youve never gotten around to that savings program
1260225 the only thing i did was open a bank account for him not an resp
1260226 effectively you get 20 for every 100 you put into your savings program
1260227 the government looked at the program and decided that theres value in engaging families in planning for a higher education regardless of what your income is from the time your kids are young
1260228 its amazing to me how many people you come across who are vaguely aware of the notion of education savings plans but it hasnt driven them to actually do something about it
1260229 part of the answer has to be found in creating different and more unique partnerships with organizations that work more directly with low income communities
1260230 the focus is on the families that are in the most need of help
1260231 the canadian education savings grant you have to put money in to save and then its matched that suggests you have money to save
1260232 youre much better off to let compounding work for you in a savings program that you start early on than having compounding interest work against you in a student debt they have to incur later on
1260233 one way or the other youre going to have to pay if you want to have your child go to post secondary education
1260234 well they didnt have mobile phones in my day if you will have a phone what do you expect you should report it they cannot get away with this i am never buying you anything again you should have been more careful i told you so
1260235 are you ok are you hurt did you go to the police where did it happen
1260236 that must have been really shocking for you and very scary it must be challenging being a teenager today with all this added responsibility how can i support you
1260237 one of the first british parent coaching operation newton has extensive experience with dealing with young offenders and unlike other unscrupulous operators is properly trained and qualified
1260238 this is without doubt the most exciting digital photography announcement this year
1260239 the statements of our kenyan brother of american nationality obama on jerusalem show that he either ignores international politics and did not study the middle east conflict or that it is a campaign lie
1260240 we fear that obama will feel that because he is black with an inferiority complex this will make him behave worse than the whites
1260241 we tell him to be proud of himself as a black and feel that all africa is behind him
1260242 the same fate as former us president john f kennedy when he promised to look into israels nuclear programme
1260243 no matter how long a log stays in the water it doesnt become a crocodile
1260244 it is far better to be free to govern or misgovern yourself than to be governed by anybody else
1260245 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends
1260246 the more we lock spammers down the more techniques they try to get around us
1260247 almost 45 percent of all email is now spam and that number is growing each year nearly three trillion spam messages are sent each year 13 times the total snail mail delivered by the u s postal service the average wired american is hit with nearly 2 200 spam messages annually this after most isps have filtered 80 90 percent of the junk messages some reports indicate that these numbers could increase by five times in the near future
1260248 british and allied fliers were depicted as cowardly murderers and americans in particular as gangsters in the style of al capone at the same time german propaganda sought to alienate americans and british from each other and both these western belligerents from the soviets
1260249 information that is spread for the purpose of promoting some cause such as a doctrine in a war
1260250 web spam pages use various techniques to achieve higher than deserved rankings in a search engines results while human experts can identify spam it is too expensive to manually evaluate a large number of pages instead we propose techniques to semi automatically separate reputable good pages from spam we first select a small set of seed pages to be evaluated by an expert once we manually identify the reputable seed pages we use the link structure of the web to discover other pages that are likely to be good in this paper we discuss possible ways to implement the seed selection and the discovery of good pages we present results of experiments run on the world wide web indexed by altavista and evaluate the performance of our techniques our results show that we can effectively filter out spam from a significant fraction of the web based on a good seed set of less than 200 sites
1260251 human editors help search engines combat search engine spam but reviewing all content is impractical trustrank places a core vote of trust on a seed set of reviewed sites to help search engines identify pages that would be considered useful from pages that would be considered spam this trust is attenuated to other sites through links from the seed sites

1260255 dan is one of the brightest young coaches in the american hockey league and is more than ready to take on the role of guiding the wilkes barre scranton penguins
1260256 he has already helped in the development of several players who have made an impact in pittsburgh and his two years behind the bench in wilkes barre give him a unique knowledge of our top prospects
1260257 i am extremely excited about the opportunity to continue my coaching career with the wilkes barre scranton penguins
1260258 its been a goal of mine to become a head coach in the american hockey league and i cant think of a better place to have that goal come to fruition
1260259 you are going to be famous because you are so talented rah rah rah

1260261 oakeshott has polled two thirds of the vote and won with a clear majority at the last two state elections as an independent and hed take that lead into the federal by election
1260262 when i was composing the music for the award ceremony i was thinking what makes a champion
1260263 ten people died in bara a tribal district and 10 more were killed in suburban villages of peshawar
1260264 geological maps are essential tools in finding natural resources e g water hydrocarbons and minerals and when planning to mitigate geohazards e g earthquakes volcanoes and radon
1260265 natural resources are a crucial source of wealth for all nations especially those that need to develop and build their economies
1260266 knowledge of the rocks that we all live on has become increasingly important and sharing that knowledge at a time of global environmental change is crucial
1260267 today you can go to the onegeology website and get geological maps from across the globe from an overview of our entire planet to larger scale maps of the rocks of individual nations
1260268 you also have the ability to hop from this web site to higher resolution applied maps and data on linked national web sites participating nations are contributing to a legacy for humankind by acting locally they are thinking globally
1260269 if other marine species respond similarly and theres no evidence yet that they were in trouble
1260270 the analogies are quite simple we observed a 25 percent reduction in fertilization success at reduced ph which is equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in the spawning stock of the species
1260271 the current problem is being caused by the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not the absolute level
1260272 to put it simply the carbon dioxide is rising too quickly for the oceans natural buffering system to catch up
1260273 we need to begin to respond globally to counteract the coming impacts of ocean acidification an effort requiring at least as much global participation as current efforts to stem carbon dioxide emissions
1260274 i really hope im wrong about the broader implications of our work however the available evidence points to the conclusion that at present acidification is the biggest threat to the long term viability of our ocean ecosystems and especially to key invertebrate species that maintain many of the marine ecosystems on which we rely for food protection and recreation
1260275 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
1260276 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
1260277 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
1260278 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
1260279 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
1260280 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
1260281 impacts on individual species indicate wider changes at the biome level that will potentially change conditions for many plant and animal species in addition to ecosystem services to humans
1260282 the central u s is characterized by an ecotone thats the intersection of forest in the east and grassland in the west
1260283 the border between these ecosystems is largely determined by climate variability and it is likely that climate change will shift the location of this and other ecological boundaries worldwide
1260284 lynx is one species that is vulnerable but the potential impacts of climate change on entire ecosystems are even more alarming
1260285 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid
1260286 my wife was watching television then suddenly my daughter cried out my shutters exploded and part of our roof flew off
1260287 i have rarely seen anything like this outside of a war zone this looks like scenes that i saw in south lebanon it looks like it has been hit by a bomb
1260288 the windows of my apartment suddenly blew up i lay down on the ground i just thought i was going to die
1260289 you work your whole life and everything is gone in a few seconds
1260290 vaccine science is still more of an art than a science
1260291 we need big investments for the future not only in the basic science of hiv prevention but also in clinical trials for an hiv vaccine
1260292 we have to be unafraid to fail the road to success begins with setbacks
1260293 we have to be unafraid of failure science is not a straight line
1260294 there is a true cause for optimism in the field
1260295 perbincangan dalam konteks kebebasan dan dalam konteks untuk membincangkan dengan semangat terbuka ia ada pengaruh positif dan negatif
1260296 saya akan mengambil pandangan ahli jawatankuasa fatwa dan kita akan bawa resolusi ini ke kabinet dan kemudian dipersembahkan kepada majlis raja raja melayu untuk memohon diluluskan
1260297 saya fikir perlakuan ini adalah salah kerana ia digunakan untuk menggalakkan ketegangan dan saya telah mengarahkan polis dari unit cawangan khas menangkap mereka yang menggalakkan perkara sebegitu
1260298 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
1260299 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
1260300 estimates of maximum bite force for t rex are around 3 1 tonnes greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
1260301 youre waiting around and in that time you couldve gotten something done like walk the dog
1260302 obviously for my job and doctors appointments i go out of my way to be on time
1260303 that way his being late equals him being on time
1260304 and heres the simple fact i got here on time and you can manage to as well
1260305 if its a friend who does this a lot and it really puts you out remind them that your time is just as valuable as theirs
1260306 in new york they wait until the agreed meeting time and then they go were more laid back and tolerate more than we probably should
1260307 if were talking about someone who is chronically late they might be avoiding anxiety or anger or resisting something
1260308 perhaps they are overscheduled and need to say no once in a while
1260309 he always taught me its better to be safe than sorry
1260310 if im late for practice it just stresses me out
1260311 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1260312 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1260313 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1260314 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1260315 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1260316 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1260317 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1260318 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1260319 for four days sen john mccain and his allies have accused sen barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true
1260320 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
1260321 this is my first national media marketing award and i will surely treasure it for life i worked really hard and it paid off big time
1260322 i know the academy of national media marketing design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
1260323 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual national media marketing award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a national media marketing project
1260324 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
1260325 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our national media marketing industry can benefit from this special night
1260326 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
1260327 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
1260328 there is no form of anguish with a name whose tortures human nature could not bear
1260329 i thought id tell you that ive had a little crush on you
1260330 this is my home dog which i have been rearing i killed it on demand of my spirits who directed me to offer its body parts to them
1260331 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small
1260332 and on the other side the risks are large and dramatic
1260333 we felt with sufficient certainty that your risk of being harmed exceeded your potential benefits starting at age 75
1260334 there is this idea that more is always better and if a test is available we should use it
1260335 a lot of time were doing more harm than good
1260336 its a disservice to patients a lot of men die from prostate cancer and theres just an overwhelming amount of evidence that screening saves lives

1260339 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1260340 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy the last release of oil from the strategic reserve came in response to hurricane katrina but the only crisis that has developed since barack obama last rejected this idea 28 days ago is a slide in his poll numbers
1260341 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1260342 the governor needs to stop the political theater and focus on rustling up two votes from his own party
1260343 not knowing when or if you are going to get a paycheck is hard
1260344 the three hour wait was exhausting it was crowded and hot
1260345 there were no seats no room i had to stand the entire time and then i failed my test
1260346 most of those who work behind the counters technically have a temporary status so they have no protection
1260347 at busy dmv offices they have a lot of these workers so without them there are not enough people to serve the public
1260348 the governors mean spirited executive order will have a devastating impact not only to state employees and their families but to all californians
1260349 as weve witnessed with our local dmv branches this action has already made a serious impact on californians day to day lives
1260350 a tax increase will worsen an already languishing economy housing values are plummeting jobs are at risk and everything costs more for the average californian
1260351 i cannot envision any republican legislator supporting such a proposal
1260352 i give my thanks to everybody in the media for not calling me about the race we had at indianapolis which was just a debacle that was just a horrible race i dont know what i would have said if somebody called me last week but im sure i would be apologizing for it today
1260353 ill say this and he may slap me and he can if he wants but he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson or tony stewart or with anybody else and i think he can close the deal the championship ultimately winds up normally being determined by how well you do when things go bad
1260354 the 17 has got a lot of speed and matt and chip are doing a nice job i just hope that the races in front of them and the way they unfold wont end up leaving them on the outside
1260355 i was there actually interfering with crew chief bob osborne a little bit i was a little anxious that if he edwards went out and got himself a 7 8 9 second lead and a caution came or a green white checkered he might not have enough tire left as well as enough gas i was concerned and some of that manifested itself into some anxiety that i introduced that was probably unnecessary
1260356 the confidence will manifest itself in better pit stops than youll have if everybody is frustrated and dragging around theyll come together and bob will be able to get more energy out of them and be able to channel the energy in very positive ways
1260357 i wasnt aware about the shouting match but the crew chief is empowered in our world to make the final decision hes the captain of the ship the driver knows more about whats going on right in front of him as it relates to who has gone down pit road and who didnt go but bob made a courageous call he still needs to make that decision whatever he feels is right is what we need to do thats his job
1260358 in this league you better not ease your mind because you never know what may happen
1260359 you dont stay on edge with being nervous and having anxiety you just stay focused on what you have to do to get better whether its favre or anybody else in this league they are looking to put the best man out on the field theyll replace you in a heartbeat
1260360 i just caught a glimpse of it as i was eating breakfast just to see whats going on
1260361 i couldnt figure it all out its too complicated for me for me its business as usual
1260362 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it

1260375 i had a dream and in it a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell it turned upside down and the tent collapsed
1260376 this is no other than the sword of gideon son of joash a man of israel into his hand god has given midian and all the army
1260377 get up for the lord has given the army of midian into your hand
1260378 look at me and do the same when i come to the outskirts of the camp do as i do
1260379 i have no silver or gold but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth stand up and walk
1260380 at the moment the proposed local area meetings are independent of the council but will have a senior officer present to inform the community of what is going on
1260381 it is the local residents who know more about the area than council employees
1260382 i welcome the fact that council is going someway towards restoring what we had before
1260383 i am starting a group up in thirroul and whether it is sanctioned or not i will continue to hold those meetings
1260384 travel the most significant change is in out of state travel to meet the needs of the science office the increase will allow staff to keep abreast of scientific status and the needs and priorities within each portfolio area s of focus to better move the science forward through cirms funding programs the staff will attend clinical meetings in several specialty areas engineering meetings as well as biology meetings across stem cell disciplines in order to have an integrated picture of state of the art and forward looking research agendas
1260385 is the travel necessary no useful for cirm probably not very much good for bob and alan absolutely

1260398 anything can be done to bring down the price of fuel at the pump

1260410 i spoke to the disability rights commission who offered conciliation to the hospital but received no response and they advised me to take court action
1260411 i did not pursue the case for myself but because i was disgusted with the lack of basic facilities available the basic human rights for disabled people abandoned by the area hospital
1260412 we can only apologise again to mrs corner for the distress this caused

1260416 demi tuhan yang diriku berada dalam genggaman nya seandainya kamu tidak berdosa nescaya allah akan mematikan kamu kemudian allah akan mendatangkan satu kaum yang melakukan dosa dan mereka memohon keampunan kepada allah lantas allah mengampuni mereka
1260417 tuhan kita turun ke langit dunia pada waktu malam tatkala tiba sepertiga malam yang akhir lalu berfirman siapakah yang berdoa kepada ku nescaya aku terima siapakah yang meminta kepada ku nescaya aku beri dan siapakah yang meminta ampun nescaya aku ampuni
1260418 aku tahu bila allah mencintaiku iaitu saat aku membenci segala kejahatanku
1260419 apabila allah mencintai seseorang maka ia membuatnya faham mengenai agamanya

1260432 it is common knowledge that dicaprio has slavic roots his ancestors on his mothers side emigrated from russia to germany
1260433 thats how i knew i made it when i heard this song at safeway heaven is a place on earth

1260446 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church

1260458 i just dont want him to get away with it
1260459 i dont know what gave him the right to think he could not only grab me but then physically assault my boyfriend just for defending me
1260460 hes never gotten into a fight hes never been arrested hes never gotten into trouble
1260461 you cant compare me to him im just a youngster trying to learn the ropes what he was able to accomplish in his career i really admire and respect him for but im not even close to being a troy brown and you cant even make that comparison
1260462 i believe guys like devin hester and cribbs and those guys have definitely changed the position
1260463 theyve done some things over the past couple of years that have been very impressive and teams have to game plan for that but you cant put me on that level yet i havent returned a kick in a game in the nfl im still trying to learn and just get better one day at a time in practice
1260464 but what those guys have been able to do with their return units has been very impressive i think it definitely has changed the way people look at special teams a little bit
1260465 ive had an appreciation for blocking since a young age
1260466 ive been born and raised with that i definitely have an appreciation for what those guys do its not easy especially blocking on kickoff return its not easy its one of the hardest plays in football and i respect what those guys do
1260467 it kind of helped me to come around at the time i did when those guys were doing their thing
1260468 definitely it opens a lot of eyes and it gives a lot of guys opportunities that might not have had opportunities to contribute to the game i feel like in college that was something i was able to do and hopefully i continue to work hard here and find a role on this team as well
1260469 i am delighted that baglan energy park is bucking the economic trend and still attracting business and jobs to the area
1260470 of course this builds on our recent success in places like amazon where we attracted 1 300 jobs
1260471 its tremendous news you cant argue with the figures with regards to the new development at baglan energy park
1260472 it builds on the success of the sa1 development next door round the corner in swansea and obviously the amazon development
1260473 on the first and second floors there will be office accommodation of course the developer is now looking at attracting businesses into these offices and they tell me they are confident of filling these offices and getting 400 jobs into there
1260474 rejection is one thing but rejection from a fool is cruel hilarious
1260475 that was a very public indiscretion ms dass i banish you to the bucket fountain for a period of contemplation
1260476 i wish i was a little bit farther but i cant complain
1260477 im a lot farther than i was last year i put myself in a better position than i did last year so im definitely feeling good im not far off i aint quite there yet but im not that far away from it
1260478 yeah just to go back out there and build off of how i finished last year and just to get back into the swing of things
1260479 ive been practicing against my team for a lot of days now so just to get a chance to go out there and go against somebody new and see what ive got is definitely going to make me feel good
1260480 now ive got a feel for how theyre going to block and theyve got a feel for how im going to run
1260481 we both know each other and we know how things are going to play out on certain plays so i trust them a lot more they trust me a lot more to make the right reads i trust them to make the right blocks so now im running with more confidence and more patience
1260482 this is the nfl some of the greatest players who ever played this game went through more than what im going through right now
1260483 you just have to be grateful for each and every opportunity that you get out here thats all im doing is trying to show them that i deserve to be out here and as long as i keep doing what im doing and keep getting better every day the sky is the limit
1260484 it is not really a high priority right now we need to just go out there and learn how to play good defense and learn our assignments we will get to the other stuff when we get to it
1260485 the best compliment you can give a lineman like that is you dont really realize when he is in there
1260486 he is a solid guy and the last game he played in he played well and that was a big game super bowl xlii he has been a very dependable guy for us with great inside versatility

1260496 for a trainer who is making headlines around the world this is a glowing endorsement of the melbourne spring racing carnival as a truly international racing event aidan has nominated all his group 1 headline performers
1260497 these are without doubt the best quality international entries we have received since the inception of international competition in the spring racing carnival in the early 90s

1260514 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1260515 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1260516 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1260517 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1260518 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit

1260523 oh khalil can you change the subject already enough of this gay talk
1260524 whose writing style is so overtly racist so overtly racist
1260525 we are developing a large research project that will roll out over the next two years which will look at the structure of illicit drug markets
1260526 we are focusing on four locations throughout the country and will look at the impact of the market on different types of location suburban inner city more rural towns and so on we will look at the responses that are there already and what would be more effective responses
1260527 we will look at the size of drug seizures the location of them their purity and the levels of purity for different types of drugs at different levels of the market
1260528 for example traditional law enforcement approaches which focus on supply control are only limited in the effect they can have given the scale of the availability and given the adaptability of drug markets the scale of the profits that can be made means they can respond and adapt very quickly what you need to understand is what the most sustainable responses that you can make are
1260529 for example by altering purity levels traffickers and dealers are able to increase their profit margins to alleviate the effects of increased seizures and or enforcement action
1260530 has had little adverse effect on the availability of drugs
1260531 recent reviews indicate geographically targeted problem orientated policing interventions aimed at drug hotspots and involving partnerships between the police and wider community groups appear to be more effective at reducing problems to the drug market than conventional law enforcement only approaches
1260532 everybody pays attention when we burn tires this is a tool of demonstration which makes our demonstration a success when we protest we seek durable solution so nobody really cares the aftermath of the demonstration be it poisonous gas due to burning tires or destroying private and state properties
1260533 this is a continuity of trend burning tires in protest it is easily accessible easily burns and fortunately generates a lot of smoke
1260534 small elements of lead mercury nickel chromium benginedioxide and poly chlorinated hydrocarbons is exposed in the environment which is very harmful for our lungs they dissolve within the air that we breathe in
1260535 there is no system to purify the air the damage is already done
1260536 how long should we burn tires in the name of peoples welfare

1260541 praying that tomorrow will not be as cold as today because she doesnt have the coat to keep her warm
1260542 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
1260543 disappearing from the national stage unless he finds a way to squelch this story fast
1260544 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances
1260545 this isnt something you would normally see in a newspaper more than once we already wrote the one post quoting the national enquirer which slipped out before pierces ban kf and i dont think youd see more than that if there were no blogs and this was just a newspaper
1260546 its a story that were taking a long view of
1260547 weve got a big exclusive coming out this week and we are on the trail of some stuff thats even hotter
1260548 not about the photos but about the rest of the story and the story is just going to get bigger from here
1260549 everythings done incrementally so im not going to tell you exactly what our process is perhaps my time frame is different than your time frame im not worried about the rest of the media im worried about us
1260550 if you had this rumor about bill clinton it probably wouldnt cause a ripple
1260551 but given john edwards and his public relationship with his wife something close to a model of the perfect family and their perfect relationship it would hurt that much more
1260552 opponents of affirmative action are trying to get a referendum on the ballot here that would do away with affirmative action do you support that
1260553 yes i do i do not believe in quotas but i have not seen the details of some of the proposals but ive always opposed quotas
1260554 i do not have a firm enough grasp on the historical and relevant context of mccains remark in 1998 to give you the pushback that this question deserves
1260555 within minutes of posting yesterday i recognized that it was indeed heavyhanded and had it unpublished
1260556 i may be identifying with elizabeth a little too closely as an oversharing cancer survivor and all
1260557 we dont want to get it at all not even just a mention of the allegation not even second
1260558 edwards isnt considered a likely vice presidential candidate by the press
1260559 its so easy to jump to conclusions and i admit this looks bad
1260560 if the account of him being caught in a hotel rendezvous with rielle hunter was false edwards wouldnt be changing the subject hed be suing
1260561 which story gets a bigger audience a story the blogs run with but the mainstream news ignores or a story the news runs with but the blogs ignore im thinking the news comes out ahead but just barely and at this rate not for much longer
1260562 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1260563 will mccain respect obamas views once obama has studied the issue
1260564 supposed to be about supplying some needed capital to the subprime market
1260565 the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since vietnam
1260566 im a big success and im telling you losers what to do
1260567 you are probably not that good a rapper maybe you are the next lil wayne but probably not in which case you need to stay in school
1260568 i urge you all to stay in school ive seen what happened to friends of mine i know what would have happened to me the odds against people who drop out of high school are not good
1260569 so turn off the tv set put the video game away
1260570 you need to make sure your child can speak spanish
1260571 many americans with good cause didnt believe us when we said we would secure our borders and so we failed in our efforts we must prove to them that we can and will secure our borders first while respecting the dignity and rights of citizens and legal residents of the united states of america
1260572 we resolved that matter of my campaigns structure back in july
1260573 i would bet my firstborn that they will be excluded from the accounting change it would bankrupt them
1260574 unhappy california business won the support of mayor antonio r villaraigosa of los angeles who wrote a letter
1260575 the federal system to check the working papers of new hires
1260576 i find comfort in the fact that the longer im in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes that a striving for rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition and that i am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience
1260577 i dont think mccain can afford to do any more major reshuffling without running the risk of key republicans concluding that hes hopeless and abandoning him en masse
1260578 a mid size sports sedan for 60 000 a competitor to the bmw 5 series and jaguar xf
1260579 it would be my top priority yesterday today and tomorrow
1260580 but we also must proceed with a temporary worker program that is verifiable and truly temporary
1260581 in increasingly strident terms his commitment to legalizing all the illegal aliens
1260582 i dont want you to take out of context what i said during the campaign
1260583 s peaking to reporters aboard his campaign plane obama said the actress doesnt have his personal email address
1260584 she sent one email to reggie who forwarded it to me
1260585 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this email relationship
1260586 i feel like im supporting someone and having a personal dialogue with them and its amazing
1260587 failed to generate the kind of republican primary turnout typically enjoyed by house incumbents
1260588 keep a more progressive social security program from being seen as welfare
1260589 does a work test keep the eitc from being seen as welfare
1260590 the eitc has fared much better than welfare programs without a work test
1260591 then he said i bet some of you dont know this did you know spanish was spoken in arizona before english
1260592 i didnt call him i called my friend who happened to be with him at the time
1260593 black fathers who arent in the home are much more likely to sustain regular contact with their children than absentee white fathers or for that matter fathers of any other ethnic group
1260594 obama is the greatest nothing this great has happened to us in a long time the only thing we have to worry about is what well have to wear to the inauguration
1260595 hey were contributing all this money but not getting much back in benefits so the hell with this system
1260596 hey this is to help old folks whove worked all their lives
1260597 he stayed for a good almost half hour afterwards shaking hands listening to our concerns talking to us
1260598 pointed out that he supported bill clinton with both ginsberg sic and breyer
1260599 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it
1260600 it will only produce an immediate 17 increase in immigration
1260601 editorial staff is about two thirds its size in the late 1990s
1260602 on the board of five companies that granted lavish pay packages to their executives
1260603 dell makes it easy to migrate to vista on your schedule
1260604 lets see how about never that fits my schedule t
1260605 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
1260606 done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle
1260607 obama aides also said clinton is in no position to stiffen oversight after taking contributions from mortgage industry lobbyists including funds from representatives of countrywide which has been at the center of the mortgage meltdown
1260608 im glad to report that starbucks is indeed considering some sort of elite status
1260609 we dont comment on campaigns that are utter and complete failures
1260610 you find you can eliminate a fair number of people without eliminating much content
1260611 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
1260612 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
1260613 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
1260614 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
1260615 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
1260616 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
1260617 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
1260618 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
1260619 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
1260620 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to
1260621 you dont run for president unless you want to work in the administration
1260622 clearly what is going on in brazil is pushing that envelope
1260623 i would never say never but it would be a hard sell
1260624 dont you think theres a major difference between a pol who admits he sired a love child and one who denies it
1260625 voted for george bush i know it for dead certitude
1260626 i know neither actor but i assume they were acting
1260627 unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform i dont think you can take it piecemeal
1260628 because as soon you and i start to talk about the highly skilled workers our agricultural interest people are going to say look we need ag workers too
1260629 we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states
1260630 and the lesson i learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform
1260631 a flake and a poser and an attention seeking diva
1260632 im in italy to work not to get involved in a war of words
1260633 i want to do well with inter the best thing for us would be to forget about what other people are doing
1260634 ranieri hes right in what he says i am very demanding of myself and i need to win to be secure about things thats why ive won so many trophies in my career
1260635 he on the other hand has the mentality of someone who doesnt need to win and at nearly 70 years old he has won a supercoppa and another small cup
1260636 we have built a series of structures and walked away from them historically
1260637 if youve got potholes in the road people go out and fix them thats not the case with levees

1260641 the courts have repeatedly upheld the public benefits of the atlantic yards project
1260642 as expected opponents have filed another law suit opposing the states right to use eminent domain were fully confident that the courts will once again agree that this project is in the publics interest
1260643 at this point we will not be commenting on pending litigation
1260644 this is a case about the misuse of governments power to take property by eminent domain and the betrayal of public trust in service to the interests of a private developer
1260645 the deal was struck behind closed doors without first creating a comprehensive development plan or so much as considering a single alternative to ratners plan for development of the area without a bidding or competitive selection process of any kind for the project as a whole including the privilege of being given petitioners homes and businesses after they are seized by esdc without a true competitive process for the property owned by the metropolitan transit authority and without a process to allow for meaningful community input
1260646 the exercise of eminent domain to seize petitioners homes and businesses not only violates the edpl it is unnecessary
1260647 large scale development in this section of brooklyn can be done successfully and profitably without taking a single piece of privately owned land esdcs decision to take petitioners properties serves only one purpose to allow ratner to build a project of unprecedented size adjacent to property he already owns and thus to reap a profit that esdc never bothered to even consider
1260648 city procedures mandating meaningful local review planning democratic oversight and community input
1260649 rests smack in the middle of some of the most valuable real estate in brooklyn
1260650 belong to the long island rail road they use them heavily theyre critical to their operations ratner owns property across the way and he saw the yards and looked at those we had not been considering the yards directly
1260651 secondary and incidental to the benefit that inures to ratner
1260652 beneficiary of the land transfer by eminent domain was known long before the determination to proceed
1260653 substantial public financing and incentives provided for the program were not put in place before the developer was known and were only promised to ratner
1260654 occupancy of any such project shall be restricted to persons of low income as defined by law and preference shall be given to persons who live or shall have lived in such area or areas
1260655 persons who live or shall have lived in such area
1260656 shall be deemd to authorize or empower the state or any city town willage or public corporation to engage in any private business or enterprise other than the building and operation of low rent dwelling houses for persons of low income as defined by law or the loaning of money to owners of existing multiple dwellings as herein provided

1260658 there is little evidence of adverse change in the appellants cognitive abilities since he was sentenced justice neave wrote
1260659 looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1260660 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1260661 thats an indication not only that there arent going to be any more increases in interest rates but raises the question of when do they cut
1260662 the statement does not give any clues as to when that might be
1260663 additional rises in market interest rates and tougher credit standards have delivered some additional tightening of financial conditions without them having to lift a finger
1260664 there could be one by christmas theyre going to wait for more data
1260665 theyve got an easing bias but theres no timing on that theyre not in a particular rush to change

1260676 the two year results confirm our previous studies orthokine therapy provides long term relief from pain and joint dysfunction in many patients and does so more effectively than comparable treatments
1260677 long term treatment effects take on particular importance for patients suffering from arthritis since this is a chronic condition improvement in the symptoms of osteoarthritis means an improvement in patients quality of life
1260678 orthokine treatment is a safe long lasting alternative to conventional methods

1260686 it would merely prolong the failed energy policies we have seen from washington for 30 years
1260687 instead of giving oil executives another way to boost their record profits i believe we should put in place a windfall profits tax that will help to ease the burden of higher energy costs on working families and we should invest in the affordable renewable sources of energy that senator mccain has opposed in the past

1260694 china became the third force following the united states and japan but from the development on the whole we are also clear that there is a big gap of computing applications between china and the western countries on the one hand foreign brands also occupied many areas and sectors of chinas high performance applications and on the other hand high performance applications are not used enough

1260741 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership

1260753 for madison the best large one volume life is by ralph ketcham
1260754 his study and the scolding and disputing over the persecutions helped move him from the condescending idea of toleration to the more liberal concept he was to implant in the virginia bill of rights in june 1776

1260756 madisons intense study at montpelier in 1786 after his sparse breakfasts and before the evening games of whist for half bits left him as well informed on the workings of confederate governments as any man in america
1260757 the facts and lessons about the ancient and modern confederacies in a booklet of forty one pocket size pages easy to use in debate of writing
1260758 was there any way to guard against the majority consenting to a violation of such rights a positive answer to this question would in madisons mind solve the fundamental problem of republican government
1260759 in no part of the constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature and not to the executive department it is in war that the laurels are to be gathered and it is the executive brow they are to encircle the strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast ambition avarice vanity the honourable or venial love of fame are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace

1260772 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1260773 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion us dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1260774 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process
1260775 right now we have asked the county counsels office to investigate the matter and to let me know if it constitutes any violation of the law we are hoping to have a response from the county counsels office within the next week
1260776 i agree that everyone did an outstanding job on this matter however we do not need a paper trail on this everyone please delete these emails from your computers and empty the trash files thanks
1260777 typically during a routine audit we wont look at e mails being deleted
1260778 if there is something else going on that may warrant a different investigation wed have to look at a variety of factors
1260779 if it looks like something criminal was going on that would require a different type of investigation
1260780 for example plaintiffs are aware of at least one october 2007 email from marcia mayeda to josie zabala among others in which ms mayeda specifically directs dr zabala and other dacc employees copied on the email to delete emails from their computers and empty the trash files

1260789 after i dried my socks i started off toward the area known as the bottleneck but after around an hour i realized that my hands werent about to warm up and i wasnt ready to lose any fingers for the summit of k2
1260790 i realized since i was feeling quite strong that i could summit k2 without oxygen however if i wanted to keep my fingers and enjoy a normal adult life i needed to turn around and not let my ambitions get the best of me

1260794 base camp is quite somber thanks to the enormous loss of life in such a short time
1260795 at this point i am quite resentful of the people who have decided to give up hope and raise the confirmed death toll to include the still missing climbers
1260796 most people in base camp are quoting rumors or relying on what they may have seen through the telescope
1260797 thanks to the internet these lies and twisted rumors are being published as fact and people are being given hope when none exists or being misled to believe that their loved one is missing when in fact they are safe in descent or in base camp this was the case for me as i was reported missing twice
1260798 my hands are fine while my feet are black from frostbite anyway i can walk and i want to descend to the base camp
1260799 hes a sensitive guy hes packing up stuff for people that didnt make it

1260817 the statement is not the view of the mkmva we dont want to cause fear but we are saying that if the gains of democracy are being raped we will protect it none of our members would take up arms against the state that is not a view we share at the mkmva
1260818 although it is painful to see jacob zuma in court in this manner because he is one of the few people who supported the mkmva we cant say we will take up arms but we are watching this democracy closely
1260819 unwilling and incapable of reining in those who threaten violence in his name
1260820 these threats are now becoming a habit and zuma should lead from the front and challenge these statements
1260821 the public should be worried when the anc intimidates the justice system
1260822 if the statement is aimed at influencing the outcome of the court it is unacceptable
1260823 we were being asked to regularly audit the software and devices being used across south west yorkshire but were increasingly finding we just didnt physically have the time to do this
1260824 in one of our primary care trusts alone there are 74 different gp surgeries and additional health centres it was simply too difficult to manage
1260825 also the manual process meant that by the time we had finished the information we had collected was out of date and work would often be duplicated for different projects because previously collected data would need to be double checked or previous audits would have omitted the data required
1260826 with sam suite we can tell organisations exactly what is on their network from our headquarters rather than spending unnecessary time and money on sending an engineer to a site to audit their im amp t estate
1260827 this has massive implications for our current expenditure as it allows us to make much more informed and efficient decisions on all aspects of it infrastructure
1260828 it also ensures we are saving more money from avoiding over licensing as we work towards itil certification we are expecting to see more and more benefits both in terms of productivity and cost savings as the automated system frees up so many more resources for us it has also allowed us to start creating a configuration management database
1260829 it is very common for software and asset visibility to be an issue for any organisation it has grown incrementally over time without controls and without visibility the products will get worse
1260830 the health informatics service now has full visibility of hardware and software assets across the network and will be able to electronically capture validate and reconcile licences for all users this should help to save time and deliver cost savings on the road to itil

1260855 senator obama has chosen two outstanding advocates for equality to help guide his campaign through the general election
1260856 i am personally thankful to both dave and brian for maintaining a strong working mentorship with our stonewall democrats chapters on electoral issues these are two individuals who truly understand successful grassroots organizing especially across communities of color faith and organized labor with their appointments senator obama is signaling that his campaign is moving beyond models of simple outreach to the lgbt community and into a potentially transformative organizing partnership not yet seen in presidential politics
1260857 we are thrilled that dave and brian will continue to build on the partnerships they maintain with stonewall democrats chapters to mobilize lgbt and pro equality voters
1260858 both the obama campaign and the stonewall democrats share a grassroots organizing model which builds national change from the ground up we have full confidence in dave and his ability to educate and mobilize the lgbt community in this incredibly important election year
1260859 anybody can fall down but it takes a man to get up
1260860 fuera paresido mi marido salto diciendo no para nada no se parese
1260861 its time to live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect lets enact federal civil rights legislation to outlaw hate crimes and protect workers against discrimination based upon sexual orientation and gender identity or expression
1260862 we are ready to accomplish these goals because of the courage and persistence of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people who have been working every day to achieve equal rights the gay couple who demand equal treatment in our family laws as they raise their children the lesbian soldier who wants nothing more than to serve her country openly and honestly the transgender workers who ask for the simple dignity of being judged by the quality of their work generations of lgbt americans at once ordinary and extraordinary have made possible this moment in our history with leadership and hard work we can fulfill the promise of equality for all
1260863 you homeschool wow thats great i could never homeschool its just not a fit for me
1260864 mom im not going to be going to homeschool next year im going to go to a class for my school
1260865 our nation is safer and more secure because of the contributions made by all women including lesbian and bisexual women in the armed forces
1260866 the time has come for the pentagon and military leaders to recommend congress repeal
1260867 there are some situations so obvious that you almost feel you dont have to comment upon them then you wake up one morning and realize not only should you have expressed your opinion but you should have done it loudly and resoundingly and repeatedly the odious concept of former georgia senator sam nunn serving on a ticket with senator obama is one of those situations
1260868 if i could dream at all it would be about you and im not ashamed of it
1260869 we were searching for someone who is both visionary and practical has an understanding of our movements history and can take advantage of new opportunities that lie ahead
1260870 there are very few people who have the right combination of voice skills passion fearlessness and relationships in and outside the movement to take the task force to the next level weve found that person in rea carey
1260871 for 35 years the task force has been the organization that says the hard things does the hard work and pushes the envelope in strategic ways we are confident that rea is the right leader for the task force as we work toward our vision of a society that welcomes respects and honors each and every lesbian gay bisexual and transgender person
1260872 i believe our movement is on the cusp of taking the gains of the last 40 years and translating them into permanent and society changing advances
1260873 the last two years alone have shown astonishing progress in nondiscrimination laws and relationship recognition in the states and yet we have a long way to go in tackling other challenges such as economic and healthcare hardships faced by lgbt people appropriate care for the growing number of lgbt seniors and helping progressive people of faith assert their belief in the humanity of lgbt people and certainly we as a movement will fail in the long run if we do not attend to the systemic barriers to our becoming a more racially diverse and dynamic force for change
1260874 rea proved to be an extremely strong and charismatic leader in the interim position
1260875 we have been impressed by her steady hand her strategic mindset and her ability to make and carry out the tough decisions required in leading a national organization
1260876 rea is an extraordinary leader a brilliant thinker and passionately committed to complete equality for our people her appointment as the new executive director is not only wonderful for the task force and its future but for the entire movement
1260877 reas appointment is a smart choice for the task force ive worked with rea over many years and she has the vision the management and fundraising skills and the ability to play well with others necessary for such an important role in our movement
1260878 reas values are solid and her commitment to ensuring that our whole community moves forward together
1260879 the task force is spot on with reas appointment her career has shown her to be a committed collaborator and coalition builder her leadership in establishing the academy for leadership and action is a critical step in ensuring our future success as we work together to build a more diverse more dynamic movement
1260880 rea careys strong commitment to building an inclusive movement for lgbt equality in every state will make her a great leader of the task force and we congratulate her on her new role as executive director at equality federation we look forward to our continued partnership with rea and the task force as we work together to make equality a reality in every state in this country
1260881 rea carey is an outstanding strategic leader in the movement for full equality and an unwavering voice for progress and change

1260892 they will be tasked with investigating the proprieties of actions of the justices in the decision of the court of appeals and also the allegation in the attempt to bribe a justice of the ca
1260893 the fact that the case was immediately calendared in a special en banc session that already itself shows the urgency and importance of the matter
1260894 when in an original action or petition for review any of these actions or proceedings namely 1 giving due course 2 granting writ of preliminary injunction the case shall remain with the justice to whom the case is assigned for study and report and the justices who participated therein regardless of their transfer to other divisions in the same station
1260895 there is no doubt that the special 9th division gave due course to the petition after it set the same for oral arguments required the parties to submit their memoranda and considered the petition submitted for resolution
1260896 hu jintaos leadership appears to have chosen no other means than force and intimidation to restore control in tibet and has imposed a brutal crackdown that owes more to the political extremism and paranoia of the maoist era than to a 21st century would be superpower as a matter of urgency world leaders attending the olympics must publicly express concern in beijing about the crackdown in tibet and the hardline policies that led to the spring uprising
1260897 even in these more challenging times of raw material price increases and consumer uncertainty in some markets around the world the growth markets in eastern europe and asia remained strong
1260898 our performance in the first half of the year puts us firmly on track to achieve all of our financial targets for 2008

1260900 the story of us creating more partnerships and creating more revenue is the best story that rutgers has
1260901 i make no apologies for the great success our company and our people have had at rutgers
1260902 i think they made a mistake by not making all elements of the contract or at least the compensation package public
1260903 some individual clinics have genuinely struggled to manage the implementation of cerner in the main these clinics tend to be those with the largest volume of patients

1260905 when faced with a crippling structural deficit in maryland we asked our neighbors to embrace once again the politics of posterity

1260907 healthcare is moving toward an era where transparent results will become increasingly crucial for survival
1260908 those leadership teams who are already preparing for that era in their own culture will have an advantage in the times ahead
1260909 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1260910 we have never done this before in our lives hopefully it doesnt show
1260911 shocking behavior you should be ashamed i hope your mommys not going to watch this is your mommy going to watch this
1260912 sayang kenapa aku selalu gelisah setelah wanita tua di lampu merah itu aku belum ingin tidur malam ini kantukku sudah hilang kenapa mesti ada manusia yang hidup seperti itu di dunia ini mengapa kita begitu egois
1260913 apalah yang bisa kita buat sayang hanya doa yang bisa kita lakukan tapi apa kamu tidak ingat apa kata pastor surya tadi burung pipit saja diperhatikannya apalagi kita manusia tuhan telah menentukan jalan hidup kita masing masing
1260914 dengan mendoakannya paling tidak kamu peduli dengan dia semoga tuhan mendengarnya kita juga bisa membantunya kalau kita mau dengan memberi dari kekurangan kita kenapa tidak
1260915 sebenarnya kita telah membantunya setiap minggu kita telah memberikan persembahan ke gereja dan walikota kita pun selalu menagih pajak dari masyarakat lalu apakah memang tak ada sikap pemerintah kita untuk tuna wisma seperti wanita tua itu di negeri ini herannya gereja pun selalu sibuk dengan pembanguan gereja yang lebih megah padahal katanya manusia harus saling mengasihi satu sama lain
1260916 sudahlah berdebat denganmu aku memang selalu kalah sebaiknya kamu berdoa buat dia setidaknya hatimu tenang jangan lama tidur ya besok kan kamu harus bekerja
1260917 setiap manusia memiliki jalan hidupnya dia telah menyelesaikan kehidupannya dengan akhir yang sedih tapi siapa tahu kehidupan sesudah kematian hanya tuhan yang tahu

1260919 when the signing has taken place rights might be violated so to prevent violation of certain rights of the people the court decided to issue the tro
1260920 we submit to the sound discretion of the supreme court
1260921 it is the ultimate arbiter of issues and so the signing will have to be canceled
1260922 its just a resetting of the signing this is one of the dynamics of democracy
1260923 its a setback but we will let the panels decide on whatever measures they want to take to address this recent development
1260924 these negotiations include definite military national security and diplomatic concerns and have involved the presence of a foreign mediator this being so the entire process the negotiations involving the said moa and the draft documents thereof resulting from said negotiations is covered by the doctrine of executive privilege which prevents the disclosure of information that could subvert military or diplomatic objectives
1260925 they do not have an unfettered access to everything as these rights are subject to certain limitations
1260926 notably there are matters which despite their being of public interest and concern are considered privileged in nature
1260927 petitioners do not stand to suffer any irreparable or material injury as the final decision on whether they shall be part of the expanded armm or not belongs to the people of north cotabato
1260928 nothing would get done as numerous interests and heightened emotions would get in the way of compromise
1260929 the nondisclosure of the provisions of the moa has deprived the people of its right to information and to participate in the decision making process this is a blatant violation of the constitutional rights of the people
1260930 to hide behind the mantle of national security so that the people would remain in the dark on matters affecting their lives and properties is a travesty of justice and of the constitutional rights of the people
1260931 we are confident that the supreme court will uphold the position of the panel in crafting this momentous and historical agreement that will address the longstanding problems of mindanao and the country as a whole
1260932 this will allow a dispassionate objective discussion of the merits of the issues that surround the said ancestral domain agreement so it might be good that at this early stage the supreme court will be part of that due diligence effort in taking a look at this agreement in its totality and also take a look at its provision
1260933 this is an important lesson for government peace panels that on matters that affect peoples rights they must be consulted first
1260934 we all desire peace in mindanao but it must not be obtained at the expense of our territorial integrity and certainly not by methods that desire transparency and are in apparent haste
1260935 seven years of bumper crops are on their way years of plenty endless wheat and tons of hay your farms will boom there wont be room to store the surplus food you grow
1260936 after that the future doesnt look so bright egypts luck will change completely overnight and famines hand will stalk the land with food an all time low

1260942 ha estado omisa perdida y dormida ante anomal as graves en las condiciones de trabajo que privan en las plataformas petroleras
1260943 la impunidad es consecuencia de las omisiones de la autoridad laboral porque ha permitido a pemex trabajar sin restricci n alguna y a las empresas contratistas en absoluta libertad sin condiciones de higiene y seguridad para miles de trabajadores de mar y tierra
1260944 en el caso de pemex hablamos de corrupci n e impunidad
1260945 es apenas una muestra de la corrupci n que impera en petr leos mexicanos
1260946 para saber cuando menos los argumentos que tienen acerca de esas omisiones pero tambi n para que respondan a lo que se dijo p blicamente de las causas del accidente

1260964 este documento se lo hice llegar al presidente calder n el pasado 20 de noviembre y el an lisis que se hizo tiene como nico objetivo mejorar las cosas en el deporte de m xico
1260965 si ste viol la ley y dispuso indebidamente del patrimonio de los mexicanos tiene que pagar por ello pero felipe calder n est generando un clima de incredulidad y de falta de confiabilidad me parece que es tratar de exculpar a alguien sobre quien la comisi n a n no concluye su investigaci n ni ha entregado un informe
1260966 sin embargo en todo lo que sea vinculatorio con el patrimonio del ex presidente como es el caso de los bribiesca sahag n la comisi n no puede tener ninguna limitante o negarnos como representantes populares y servidores p blicos a recibir cualquier informaci n que pueda ayudarnos
1260967 si alg n funcionario o ex funcionario dispuso del patrimonio de los mexicanos debemos saberlo y entregar la informaci n a la instancia correspondiente para que sta decida
1260968 the role of art in mass actions is an integral one
1260969 popularize art forms that carry out the aspirations of the people for a freer society
1260970 in the philippines rap music which has a progressive origin appeals mostly to youths belonging to the marginalized sectors since it can be played even without musical instruments that they cannot possibly afford
1260971 the story of poorita family is the story of countless filipino families workers government employees such as teachers and students are all oppressed and exploited in a systematic way
1260972 it had achieved its goal of showing the utter disgust of the people toward the president and her administration

1260974 wij zitten in het snelst groeiende segment van de it sector
1260975 nog steeds halen we veertig procent omzet uit onze mainframe oplossingen
1260976 door technologische innovaties en strategische overnames wij waren drie jaar geleden de eerste die business service management op de markt brachten
1260977 het mainframe speelt weer de hoofdrol en hp is niet in staat om mainframes te beheren wij kunnen de complete ict infrastructuur w l aan
1260978 het beheer van het datacenter is tegenwoordig veel duurder dan de aanschaf van de hardware bedrijven moeten w l bezuinigen op het beheer eerst is dat gebeurd door het offshoren van activiteiten maar er is meer nodig dat gebeurt met automatisering van de ict processen en bladelogic is daar sterk in
1260979 wij hadden bijna een partnerdeal met eds waarbij de hp beheersoftware vervangen zou worden door onze oplossingen die handel gaat hoogstwaarschijnlijk niet door
1260980 hp nu duidelijk heeft gemaakt dat het oorlog is hp is nu ook een concurrent van bedrijven voor systeemintegratie zoals cap gemini en logica dat kan voor ons voordelig uitpakken in onze concurrentiestrijd met hp grote dienstverleners zullen minder snel voor hp beheersoftware kiezen
1260981 ibm behoort tot onze top 20 klanten ik verwacht dat daar niet veel gaat veranderen
1260982 bedrijven zoeken bewust naar mogelijkheden om hun kosten te drukken met onze oplossingen voor business service management is het mogelijk de beheerkosten drastisch te laten dalen we hebben bijvoorbeeld de laatste tijd opvallend veel orders binnengehaald in de financi le sector
1260983 it was a legitimate encounter with the npa new peoples army
1260984 the on going atrocities gross violations of indigenous peoples and collective rights being perpetrated by the 21st and 77th ibpa against innocent civilians in kalinga
1260985 all these victims were falsely accused as combatants and members or supporters of the npa
1260986 malaca ang the national security council nsc and the department of justice doj masterminded this highly irregular mafia style and grossly diabolical transfer of echanis they have been planning something evil against our colleague
1260987 let me remind the national security gang in the presidential palace headed by mrs gloria macapagal arroyo her security adviser norberto gonzales and the twin evil brother of norberto justice secretary raul gonzalez that echanis is a political prisoner a decent and principled man wrongly accused by this criminal regime of mrs arroyo he is not a common criminal accused of petty street crimes
1260988 everything was done in a highly questionable manner did the pnp file any motion or request for echaniss transfer did judge medina approve the pnp request for echaniss transfer how come the lawyers and relatives of echanis were not informed about his transfer and of this latest legal twisting escapade of the arroyo government why is everything kept like the best kept secret of the national security council
1260989 echanis should stay with the pnp custodial center in camp crame while his case is being tried thats why we repeat the transfer is highly irregular and absurd and it only revealed the national conspiracy and sinister agenda of arroyo and her militarist advisers which is to further persecute and make life more miserable for echanis
1260990 we fear for ka randys security considering his status as a political prisoner were also afraid that he will be subjected to tremendous suffering given the prison conditions and his health
1260991 this politically motivated case has been on hold since april 2007 the arroyo government and its state security forces should have desisted from arresting those included in the questionable charge sheet
1260992 special project of the palace created inter agency legal action group ialag
1260993 gonzales and then afp chief hermogenes esperons grave digging stunt in inopacan leyte is a special project of ms arroyos ialag in a desperate bid to immobilize those who strongly oppose her anti people political and economic policies
1260994 the continuing injustice committed by the arroyo government against echanis should not be tolerated
1260995 he became active once more with selda and helped in processing claimants in a class suit against the marcos dictatorship he was also instrumental in establishing the human rights group karapatan alliance for the advancement of peoples rights
1260996 my husband is a dignified patriotic and pro masses person he has been a perpetual victim of state terrorism and government and military persecution
1260997 dad dont worry you dont have to buy me everything i like
1260998 we have ordered a magisterial probe into the police firing in samba on protestors in which two persons were killed yesterday
1260999 by and large the elections were held in a peaceful atmosphere and no major untoward incident was reported
1261000 its a long cherished dream to work with salman khan and as soon as i find a script which suits his image i will approach him
1261001 i am trying to do something different in the film which is a romantic comedy
1261002 i signed harman because he totally suits the character in whats your raashee besides i liked harmans performance in love story 2050 he is a great dancer too
1261003 this is really a moment of happiness for jharkhand that dhoni is being awarded with the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award he deserves it
1261004 we will celebrate along with our students and sports department of the school today
1261005 i am proud he was a student of our school he had the potential of getting the rajiv gandhi khel ratna
1261006 we are very happy he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the icc world twenty20 and the tri series in australia mark him out as the ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
1261007 i swear ive seen a lot of stuff in my life but that was awesome
1261008 as human rights defenders we are very thankful for the attention given by the united nations that resulted to the urgent action of the government
1261009 we are also pleased with our friends from other international human rights groups who have reported my case to the two un special rapporteurs we are somehow hopeful that something good will happen out of these efforts
1261010 i am not amenable to having a police escort as i need to protect the interest and safety of our clients
1261011 it would be inappropriate and unethical to work with such condition especially that our clients have given to us their trust and considering the confidentiality of the information they give us
1261012 we have been very vocal in criticizing the arroyo government and its implementation of oplan bantay laya 1 and 2 this poses dangers to our lives
1261013 ultimately whether we have a stadium or not is down to us
1261014 is this another prejudice or just arrogance id argue that ami stadium isnt very lancaster park but welcome to the modern world
1261015 with respect to kiwibank i shouldnt have made the comments i made national has had no discussions about kiwibank and has no plans to sell it
1261016 comments i made regarding the complexity of wff have been construed as criticism of john key that is wrong my repeated responses to this question yesterday reflected my determination not to widen the debate not an attempt to criticise john key
1261017 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1261018 that just highlights how important it is to intervene early and set healthy lifestyle patterns early on
1261019 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
1261020 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
1261021 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
1261022 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
1261023 he got his name on a lot of these publications because he was providing the spores
1261024 that is one of the reasons he was on so many publications so many of the studies were conducted with his spores
1261025 he was not a lone wolf kind of guy he liked to work with other people and solve technical problems
1261026 really critical in identifying better methods of spore production and in refining the qualities of these spore lots so they had consistent characteristics in terms of concentration and viability
1261027 ensuring the welfare and safety of those in our custody is one of our top priorities
1261028 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1261029 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1261030 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1261031 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor
1261032 i told her i could send her more medicine but she said they would not give it to her they were mostly giving her tylenol
1261033 he told me that victoria wasnt eating and was urinating blood but that the officials still were not paying her any mind
1261034 he told me get outside help but try not to worry
1261035 her foot was chained to the bed and when she tried to turn over it would hurt her
1261036 that made it twice as hard it was so humiliating no human should have to live their last days like that
1261037 the race for the white house is tied with barack obama and john mccain each attracting 44 of the vote however when leaners are included its mccain 47 and obama 46
1261038 responding in logical measured terms that rationally pushes back on mccains ads they are missing the emotional side of the attacks that is the determining factor in 98 of decisionmaking and thus voting
1261039 what if the batteries were taken out of my smoke detector
1261040 thats unlikely since no one touches it why would anyone do that theres no point in checking it because i check it every night and its always fine
1261041 i know i made sure to close it this time i just have to trust that i did it or ill never get over this
1261042 a writer who uses the language to paint and to play word music
1261043 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1261044 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1261045 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1261046 sad to say we have been informed that until now musa could not talk so we could not get relevant information from her including what happened she is in a state of paralysis
1261047 we suspect that if migrante did not bring the case to the attention of the owwa overseas workers welfare administration in dubai they would not be working hard for musas immediate repatriation she should be given proper medical treatment in the philippines
1261048 this is a serious violation of commitments made in the agreement on the management of arms and armed personnel reached between the maoists and their partners in the interim government
1261049 the peace process in nepal is facing its most difficult challenges to date
1261050 the overall security environment has become more volatile and can be expected to remain so or to become increasingly troubled in the coming weeks
1261051 we expressed disappointment like a number of other colleagues with regard to the postponement of the assembly elections and called on the government to set up a date promptly for the elections taking into account the requirements for a free fair and credible election to take place
1261052 reflected significant concerns by the maoists about their electoral prospects and about the willingness of the government of which they were a part to implement major parts of the comprehensive peace agreement
1261053 all parties must do their part in terms of cooperating with their commitments delivering on their commitments
1261054 the relatives of the victims cannot be happy with that because what is needed is that the killings and disappearances stop altogether
1261055 the reduction in the numbers does not matter so long as we dont see our relatives given justice
1261056 in some parts of the country the armed forces have followed a deliberate strategy of systematically hunting down the leaders of leftist organizations
1261057 one one hand there is success in our campaign to stop the killings and disappearances since there is a drop in their rates but still we are not happy because we havent seen our loved ones and there is still no justice
1261058 these decisions unfortunately disregard the actual state of human rights in the philippines today that has prompted the promulgation of the new remedy in the first place this spate of decisions will only encourage the re escalation of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances because of the continuing impunity which has unfortunately and unwittingly been judicially engendered further
1261059 the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances will surely be emboldened to commit more of the same
1261060 the rates may have decreased but because of what has been happening in the court of appeals we can be almost sure that the killings and disappearances will again escalate
1261061 yes in a way it encourages more human rights violations especially extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances because it shows the impunity of the perpetrators because the court of appeals shows that the perpetrators need not answer for their crimes
1261062 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
1261063 this new programme is a result of a joint un assessment undertaken in november 2006 in banke ilam and kathmandu and i am confident that together with these ngo partners we can better respond with respect to the protection and prevention of hiv aids
1261064 we monks will do this please dont join us dont do anything violent
1261065 there was only very little information about the killings now with the internet and the whole world watching i think its a totally different story monks are highly revered in the country
1261066 thanks for applying to the banal nasality air force yaar
1261067 there must be some mistake no it says here that you are a monkey pilot
1261068 no mistake sir i am a monkey pilot to be sure
1261069 but you are not a monkey binoo how can you call yourself a monkey pilot when you are not a monkey you are a human plain as can be you are a human full of humanity a human is a human like a tree is a tree what you are certainly not is a pilot monkey rather monkey pilot
1261070 but sir i am not a pilot who is a monkey but a pilot who flies monkeys i thought that was what was known as a monkey pilot
1261071 had we kn0wn there were such things as pilots who flew monkeys perhaps we would have won the war years ago this is the first time i am hearing of such a thing binoo alack we do not have a separate division for pilots of your kind for this reason i shall put you along with the monkey pilots that is the pilots who are monkeys do you have your own monkey to fly or will you be needing one i pray that it is the former for we have no flying monkeys with us rather we have no monkeys that can fly without planes
1261072 dont worry sir i do have my own flying monkey it is a rare flying monkey from the land of oz
1261073 right now it is sedated for carrying purposes but i shall awaken it with some smelling salts
1261074 wonderful binoo wonderful with this flying monkey you will win us the war
1261075 this predatory practice of charging remittances is practically feeding off our blood sweat and tears enough is enough
1261076 the 200 monthly remittances have radically shrunk and continue to shrink with the spiraling prices of almost all basic goods and services and the arroyo government refuses to scrap remittance charges and fees
1261077 we dont even see and feel where the remittance charges go theyre only being kept in somebody elses pockets stop exploiting and exporting filipino workers overseas
1261078 we pay the philippine governments paycheck yet we have no protection in return
1261079 when will the government stop sucking the blood of migrant workers you claim that they are the modern day heroes because of the money they remit that keep the economy of the country going yet you still have the audacity to tax them for the money that keeps the government alive enough is enough scrap the remittance charges now
1261080 kawawa pamilya namin sa abrud kinokotongan pa ni gloria sobra paalisin sa malakanyang ngayon na po
1261081 pity our family members who work abroad and yet they are being taxed by gloria enough is enough let us remove her from malaca ang
1261082 their hard earned money is being forcibly taken from them they are being made as milking cows to all migrant workers and their families let us oust gloria
1261083 youre a unique little snowflake but just as unique as everyone else
1261084 i have made seven kozhakattais one for each of you wash your hands before you eat i have to go now to paru athais house i will be back in one hour be good
1261085 that was not a kozhakattai that was contrary to what you believed a little mouse
1261086 yes a mouse is a small animal that belongs to one of the numerous species of rodents the best known mouse species is the common house mouse mus musculus
1261087 perhaps that is why you did not wish for me to eat it
1261088 then pray tell where is my kozhakattai did the little mouse eat it up
1261089 but i think it is much more plausible that your kozhakattai was eaten by one of your siblings only the greediest most conniving thieving little rascal of a son of mine could have done this and that is kumar
1261090 no amma to be honest i did not the little mouse ate it
1261091 how did you know of the existence of the little mouse for this heinous crime there is only one fitting punishment you will have to catch and eat that mouse
1261092 do not make the poor mouse suffer for a crime it did not commit instead i would have you have kumar regurgitate the kozhakattai he so unfairly ate
1261093 i said stop fidgeting im trying to heat my plate
1261094 what kind of business you run a chain of xerox shops dont you i just know it
1261095 thats what most people think but but i actually have a company called suraj knots
1261096 we tie knots for people who need knots and untie them for people who need knots untied youll be surprised how lucrative it is we charge around 300 rupees for tying the smallest knot
1261097 i just happened to buy something for our other little kozhakattai
1261098 why should i let you go i should just gobble you up now
1261099 if you let me go then perhaps someday when you are in need of help i will help you
1261100 you help me you pathetic little rodent do you know how many years of evolution separate my species from yours
1261101 you have amused me so i will let you go besides you would make a poor substitute for kozhakattais
1261102 just give us all your kozhakattais and we will be on our way
1261103 all the kozhakattais are over and even if they werent i wouldnt give you ruffians anything
1261104 then i guess your childrens lives are in danger madam
1261105 but just today i was amusing a friend and noticed that if you search for john ive now dropped to number 206
1261106 we are focused on digital pathology that s the only thing we do and it s the only thing weve ever done from our perspective digital pathology is managing the information that s generated by being able to digitize entire slides
1261107 the digitization of microscope slides bringing in high resolution image management searching mining of imaging data and image analysis finally the power of the internet can be used to manage information whether it s a clinical report educational content peer reviews formal or informal or second opinions all these pieces put together are something we as a company have focused on
1261108 we believe it will be a little less than two years before we have a product i think that well be able to describe it in high level detail by the end of this year but it s the sort of product that needs fda approval and that adds a certain amount of time to it
1261109 the main ones are speed of acquisition of an image quality of the image ability to navigate around the image without having to wait for the image to come up and then the ability to stream images the cost of storage has dropped by 30 to 40 percent a year
1261110 the assumption is the market will adopt digital pathology at the same rate that digital radiology was adopted so in several years we believe and at the price points were assuming the market will support that the market will be worth about 2 billion
1261111 weve looked at the market and weve made a hypothetical full adoption in the market and say it s close to 4 billion a year that s about twice the size of what ge had in their analysis we see more value in digital diagnosis that could be applied to automate things that pathologists are currently spending time on
1261112 jesse helms was larger than life and it is entirely fitting that he would join founding fathers thomas jefferson and john adams as making his last day the fourth of july

1261114 the salary of the returning hsws shall in no way be lower than the prescribed monthly pay for filipino household service workers of us 400
1261115 our concern is how would dole ensure that employers will respect and honor the provisions of the employment contract including the us 400 minimum wage eight hour work and right to a day off once a week among other rights of hsws
1261116 a labor rights pact should make foreign employers accountable to their hired hsws
1261117 will make representations with relevant jordanian authorities to review the bilateral labor agreement between jordan and the philippines which was signed by then labor secretary franklin drilon in 1988 on behalf of the philippines
1261118 the working conditions of more than half of domestic helpers comprising 95 percent of ofws in jordan can be considered unsatisfactory and problematic and need improvement
1261119 because of the difficult work conditions faced by our workers some of them become ill or develop health or mental problems

1261146 in the garden of prides the jasmine wood perfumes the ax that strikes it and the raspberry bush bleeds to death on the rubies it refuses to give up

1261148 without benefit of any religion the way i was born the way we no longer know how to die
1261149 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1261150 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1261151 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1261152 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1261153 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1261154 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over
1261155 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1261156 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1261157 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1261158 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1261159 the fact that the terrorism happened is an indication of shortcomings and we have to learn from our mistakes and seek to improve our performance in this respect
1261160 being the most burdened in times of economic crisis women are primary stakeholders in these issues

1261162 its different from the known kind of divorce the no faults divorce where you can just divorce each other without any reason just because you want to the bill has provisions to establish review bases for divorce it accommodates irreconcilable differences
1261163 you need to spend a minimum of p200 000 4 521 to avail of those remedies you also have to wait for three to five years
1261164 by having annulment as recourse for women in violent marriages the church recognizes that some marriages do not work the divorce bill is not anti family because it aims to strengthen quality marriages and relationships how can you prolong the agony of spouses especially women in violent abusive relationships that would be detrimental to women and their children

1261168 the idea is to declare all the countrys archipelagic waters and major fishing grounds as jpepa free zone areas
1261169 once a fishing ground is declared a jpepa free zone area japanese factory ships hunting philippine tunas and other precious marine resources shall be exposed opposed and if possible barred from entering the countrys territorial waters
1261170 owners of sulpicio lines admitted that the mv princess of the stars was acquired as a second hand passenger and cargo ship for 5 million
1261171 the philippine has been accommodating japans passenger cargo and commercial fishing vessels since the marcos dictatorship under the treaty of amity commerce and navigation even if the seaworthiness and the performance background of these vessels are highly questionable the ratification of jpepa will further worsen this nearly half a century problem
1261172 were these ships bought from japan as second hand ships one thing is for sure jpepa if ratified will give japan the full license to dump their old ships under the mantle of bilateral trade pact
1261173 the gains the philippine government would derive like in the form of taxes and profit sharing would be minimal compared to what japan will get from jpepa as far as the fishing aspect of the agreement is concerned
1261174 on monday aug 3 ed leaders of anti jpepa movement will make their presence felt in the senate so that the senators would know that we are watching the outcome of this latest attempt of japan to re colonize the philippines through economic slavery
1261175 kapag ibinasura ang vat sa langis at kuryente ang mas makikinabang ay ang mga may kaya na kumukonsumo ng 84 porsyento ng langis at 90 porsyento ng kuryente habang mas masasaktan ang mahihirap na mawawalan ng p80 billion para sa mga programang pinopondohan ngayon ng vat take away vat and we strip our people of the means to ride out the world food and energy crisis
1261176 it is not the well to do but the majority of the people which includes the poor who pay 90 percent of the vat on power directly and indirectly
1261177 thus the consumers themselves not the owners of the companies ultimately paid the vat on power
1261178 therefore the vat on the total of the three items 66 percent was paid indirectly by the people not the rich
1261179 this data alone already refutes arroyos claim of 84 percent share by the rich
1261180 only a fraction of the collected vat is doled out to the poor as subsidies under the signboard
1261181 a pretense to cover up how the largest part of reformed value added tax rvat revenues do not go to social programs but rather to paying off debt militarism and political patronage to prop up arroyos unprecedented unpopular rule
1261182 in contrast the administration still insists in the face of the peoples worsening problems on allotting some 24 percent of the national budget to interest payments on debt
1261183 correct math on hard data tells us that the people are better helped by removing the vat on oil and power and with the bonus that they have their dignity intact
1261184 we dont believe that the attached agencies of the da will not be transferred where the mother hen is the chicks will be
1261185 the government is very much willing to sacrifice the precious service to the filipino people to expedite the sale of these prime lands at bargain prices for quick bucks for arroyo and quezon city government officials and for the benefit of big businesses

1261313 hier bin ich mourinho und basta das einzig besondere ist der verein allerdings wei ich nach zw lf titeln in den letzten sechs jahren auch um meine gro en qualit ten
1261314 er ist mir nicht aufgefallen wir gingen abends nach den vorlesungen in den pub da war er wohl nie dabei
1261315 kaum jemand konnte so gute videoanalysen vom gegner zusammenstellen wie jos zun chst wusste niemand in barcelona wer er war und sie stellten ihn infrage weil mourinho selbst nie ein gro er spieler war doch nach kurzer zeit respektierten sein fachwissen alle auch spieler wie ronaldo hristo stoitchkov oder pep guardiola

1261354 a very narrow spread of the laser beam can greatly reduce the complexity and cost of optical systems
1261355 the idea of the single lone monster fight is almost entirely gone 4e is about mobs
1261356 everyone who has run knows that its most important value is in removing tension and allowing a release from whatever other cares the day may bring
1261357 frustration is the first step towards improvement i have no incentive to improve if im content with what i can do and if im completely satisfied with my pace distance and form as a runner its only when i face frustration and use it to fuel my dedication that i feel myself moving forwards
1261358 great people and great athletes realize early in their lives their destiny and accept it even if they do not consciously realize the how the where the what
1261359 the gun goes off and everything changes the world changes and nothing else really matters
1261360 when the meal was over we all had a quiet rest in our rooms and i meditated on the race this is the time when an athlete feels all alone in the big world opponents assume tremendous stature any runner who denies having fears nerves or some kind of disposition is a bad athlete or a liar
1261361 we run not because we think it is doing us good but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves the more restricted our society and work become the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom no one can say you must not run faster than this or jump higher than that the human spirit is indomitable
1261362 somewhere in the world someone is training when you are not when you race him he will win
1261363 having a true faith is the most difficult thing in the world many will try to take it from you
1261364 if i am still standing at the end of the race hit me with a board and knock me down because that means i didnt run hard enough
1261365 big occasions and races which have been eagerly anticipated almost to the point of dread are where great deeds can be accomplished
1261366 fear is the strongest driving force in competition not fear of ones opponent but of the skill and high standard which he represents fear too of not acquitting oneself well in the achievement of greater performances of beating formidable rivals the athlete defeats fear and conquers himself
1261367 there are two types of people those who run and those who should
1261368 today i will run what you will not so that tomorrow i can run what you cannot
1261369 the talent to be a great runner is a gift to you from god utilizing that talent is a gift from you to yourself
1261370 your toughness is made up of equal parts persistence and experience you dont so much outrun your opponents as outlast and outsmart them and the toughest opponent of all is the one inside your head
1261371 those who say it cannot be done should not interrupt those doing it
1261372 cross country isnt for everyone only those weirdos who like to run through the woods in their underwear
1261373 games require skill running requires endurance character pride physical strength and mental toughness running is a test not a game a test of faith belief will and trust in ones self so hardcore that it needs a category all to itself to define the pain when game players criticize its because they arent willing to understand not because theyre stronger running is more than a sport its a lifestyle if you have to ask us why we run youll never understand so just accept
1261374 people cant understand why a man runs they dont see any sport in it argue it lacks the sight and thrill of body contact yet the conflict is there more raw and challenging than any man versus man competition for in running it is man against himself the cruelest of opponents the other runners are not the real enemies his adversary lies within him in his ability with brain and heart to master himself and his emotions
1261375 this is the truth the clock doesnt stop until you force it to that is the elegant beauty of track it is the simplest and hardest of sports hear a gun go off and run fast thats the simple part the hard part is run faster than anybody else out there this is the truth the clock will run until somebody makes it stop it might as well be you dont you think
1261376 heart pumping muscles burning feet aching lungs screaming for air yea we run for fun
1261377 only those who attempt the absurd will achieve the impossible
1261378 a true runner ran even when he didnt feel like it and raced when he was suppose to without excuses and with nothing held back he ran to win and would die in the process running to him was real the way he did it the realest thing he knew hard as diamond it made him weary beyond comprehension but it also made him free
1261379 some people ask why i run so fast well what do you do when you hear a gun
1261380 the truth is you can always run faster but sometimes the truth hurts
1261381 no refs out of bounds fouls or benchwarmers cross country not a game
1261382 the body does not want you to do this as you run it tells you to stop but the mind must be strong you always go too far for your body you must handle the pain with strategy it is not age it is not diet it is the will to succeed
1261383 bid me run and i will strive with things impossible
1261384 we rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character character hope and hope does not disappoint us
1261385 our business in life is not to get ahead of others but to get ahead of ourselves to break our own records to outstrip our yesterday by our today
1261386 when in races take a chance it is better than wondering what you could have done
1261387 i had a dual goal in my running that was to win and to achieve excellence so i was never happy with a slow tactical time if the race were slow i would get in front and pull it up again i couldnt stand a slow race a lot of people seem to get screwed up on tactics there is only one tactic in a race and that is to always be in a position where you can win it
1261388 many runners worry about who is in the race or they think about the time they must run to win i only try to run as fast as i am capable nothing less
1261389 why is it so hard to believe that if you get out there every day and work as hard as you can youll run well or get a degree or get a good job
1261390 if youve never failed at anything youre not trying hard enough
1261391 being the first to cross the finish line makes you a winner in only one phase of life its what you do after you cross the line that really counts
1261392 nobody is going to finish this damn thing for me but me
1261393 a dream doesnt become reality through magic it takes sweat determination and hard work
1261394 a coach is someone who always makes you do what you dont want to do so you can be who youve always wanted to be
1261395 champions do not become champions when they win the event but in the hours weeks months and years that they spend preparing for it the victorious performance is merely the demonstration of their championship character
1261396 you are gonna run so hard for so long that you will wear your opponent down and when the race starts to narrow down the only kick hell have left is the one you give him in the ass on the way by
1261397 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without errors and shortcomings who knows the great devotion who spends himself in a worthy cause who at his best knows in the end the high achievement of triumph and who at worst if he fails while daring greatly knows his place shall never be with those timid and cold souls who know neither victory nor defeat
1261398 there are many things in life that will catch your eye but only a few that will catch your heart pursue those
1261399 why do you run because youre wondering if your grandchildren will too because its raining because you can and others cant because its faster than walking because that shaky leg thing is all about nervous energy because you cant fly because you can fly because your personal best is just that yours because the pain of a blister is nothing compared to the pain of stopping because you like the resistance the wind gives you because you like the resistance you give the wind just because
1261400 i do not run to add days to my life i run to add life to my days
1261401 keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions small people do that but the really great make you feel that you too are great
1261402 life is not a matter of being dealt good cards but of being able to play a poor hand well
1261403 courage is not the absence of fear courage is the mastery of fear
1261404 you cant expect to win unless you know why you lose
1261405 the greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart
1261406 destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice
1261407 endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes
1261408 to conquer oneself is a greater task than to conquer others
1261409 the abundance of love and joy that you can help each other to feel by coming together are vibrational levels that you then each will be able to access within yourself you are helping each other to remember how to access that love helping each other to remember what it feels like and that yes you do deserve it it is very important to remember that so that you can let go let go of believing that the other person has to be in your life
1261410 the more you do your healing and follow your spiritual path the more moments of each day you will have the choice to truly be present in the moment
1261411 oh my god all i wear is black i have to wear some colour

1261473 in a world where the effect of extreme weather events is becoming more severe and the potential impact of global warming is becoming ever more apparent the met office plays an increasingly vital role in researching and forecasting these events the new supercomputer is an important step in delivering our strategic targets
1261474 the met office provides essential services to the nation saving lives and protecting property through its weather forecasts and climate advice i am very pleased to approve the replacement of the met offices supercomputer which will enable it to take advantage of latest technology and thereby deliver enhanced services to the public and both government and commercial customers
1261475 it is testament to the performance and reliability of ibms system p the worlds leading platform for weather forecasting and also a tribute to ibms scientists and researchers who have helped combine meteorology with computer science that we have been selected to help the met office provide critical information 24 hours a day
1261476 buildings situated in specific postal code areas are often automatically pre marked as at risk from flooding which our analysis proves is very often not the case in reality
1261477 as a result insurers could be overlooking or offering uncompetitive quotes for certain addresses and are losing out on potential revenues by extrapolating our findings to a national scale the problem is likely to be costing insurance companies millions of pounds every year in lost opportunities
1261478 we realised that having two separate hr and payroll systems was not only time consuming but not the best use of our resources having to input information more than once also meant that there was a higher risk of error being a web enabled single solution will bring us many benefits not least cost reduction for example it is a far more cost effective approach to monitoring absence and distributing payslips

1261480 the financial operations amp business development team identified a need for document management and an opportunity to improve purchase invoice processing efficiency after a competitive tender process and an extensive evaluation exercise the british library decided upon version ones dbarchive due to its tight integration with oracle and version ones impressive customer referencability
1261481 purchase invoice approval is more efficient than ever before using version ones system in conjunction with oracles workflow the relevant approvers are automatically notified by email that there is an invoice for their authorisation by clicking on a link in the email they can instantly view the imaged invoices from their pcs enabling them to approve reject or query the invoices accordingly the accounts payable team can track where an invoice is in the approval chain and as the process is totally paperless the risk of lost invoices has been eradicated
1261482 as version ones dbarchive is scalable well be able to roll it out across the library using it to electronically store a range of incoming and outgoing finance and non finance documents we believe that the roll out of this software will undoubtedly provide us with a swift return on our investment

1261532 no worries if ive missed out on somebody your vote in the comments will still count for him
1261533 yesterdays speech by shadow childrens secretary michael gove to a left wing think tank marked another significant milestone in tory social thinking at its heart is a challenge to labours belief in an all powerful state that controls everything right down to the way parents raise and educate their children instead mr gove sets out the core tory belief that families create a stronger society than anything achieved by state control that they know what is best for themselves and their children and should have more say over their own destiny
1261534 if the governments political antennas have broken down the conservatives seem to be operating with an impressive acuity yesterdays speech to the institute for public policy research by michael gove the conservative schools spokesman was another piece of shrewd political positioning from the tories

1261538 the libertarian paternalists have made useful advances in policy they are evidence based pragmatic and in favour of choice in public services it would be excellent if politicians absorbed those principles but they should not confuse nudging for a coherent political philosophy government action regulation or doing nothing are still the weapons of choice for most issues
1261539 the national institute of adult and continuing education reports that 1 4m adult education places have been lost since 2005 adult and community learning matters to our economic future just as it matters because of the difference it makes to the quality of peoples lives in 1943 rab butlers white paper on educational reconstruction which led to the landmark 1944 education act stressed the role that education plays in building a cohesive democratic citizenship we should be no less ambitious now than we were then so we intend to establish a new adult and community learning fund with an investment of 100m every year

1261551 as you can clearly see it is a large structure and one that is particularly sensitive to crosswinds we felt that our car already delivers sufficiently in yaw and that continuing to experiment with the dorsal fin might not bring us the sufficient performance benefit wed require to make it worthwhile as such it is not something we are giving priority to at the moment

1261599 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100m a year taken from motorists how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1261600 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1261601 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence
1261602 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1261603 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1261604 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1261605 the government is clear that the best safety camera is the one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding
1261606 critique dans le cadre dun syst me ou dun mouvement did e
1261607 i dont actually believe ea is in the business of exploiting other peoples licenses with bad quality games
1261608 weve been there most of our competitors are there or have been there thats not what we do were not really after that market
1261609 now metacritic isnt always the best quality measure for some licensed games but i know a good game when i see it
1261610 weve got the first e rated shooter with our nerf game what were doing with our family game night what were doing with littlest pet shop really cool stuff what were doing with sims really cool stuff
1261611 it feels like its demographically similar but its very highly innovative i think what redeems our industry is quality and i think we take a step back every time we take a license and exploit it with a crappy game thats not what were about
1261612 we went into the pre season cup with an attitude around getting some quality games under our belts but the further we went we started thinking hang on we can go somewhere and maybe have a shot at winning this
1261613 now were in the final we want to win it the feeling in the change room and at training is just unbelievable
1261614 the belief within the team is there thats what is really noticeable weve recruited well this year and weve got a good group of boys in but its the belief within the group thats key when youve got quality players onboard and everyone has faith in themselves and each other then everything else takes care of itself
1261615 the first competition game is the important one and theres still work to do before then but were in a final now and were going to try and win it hopefully we can take a winning feeling into the first game of the new season
1261616 for a club thats been around less than 18 months its a pretty significant achievement
1261617 we havent changed how weve gone about things in pre season weve covered all the bases and now were in a final melbourne are bringing a good side and itll be great for our fans to see another match at the ring of fire to have the final at home is unique and thats very positive for the club

1261631 dimitri is a dynamic cricketer with the ability to win a match on his own
1261632 his aggressive approach to the game mirrors the philosophies of the volts and like new zealand wicketkeeper batsman brendon mccullum he is a cricketer who can change the course of a game in a very short space of time
1261633 the state otago volts are determined to build on their successes of last season and see dimitri mascarenhas as a player who can add excitement and skill in all three disciplines of the game
1261634 dimitri is clearly excited at the opportunity to play in an experienced and successful team under a management structure that encourages flair

1261696 i obviously didnt nag my old man for players when i first started because i wanted to make my own name
1261697 with all due respect to league two i couldnt see any united players coming to us when we were down there
1261698 they tend to only go out to championship sides but maybe in league one i can get a few in
1261699 it was a lot more relaxed taking on my dad than last season we both enjoyed it
1261700 it was good of him to bring such a good squad down here because theyve got a lot of games coming up
1261701 it made it a good night for my players and for the fans
1261702 peterborough were the better side in the first half and should have been 2 0 up
1261703 but there were some plus points for us as well rafael da silva played the full 90 minutes and was pleasing and his brother fabio played 45 minutes as well
1261704 i was really pleased with their contributions and it will be interesting to see how they get on this season
1261705 the squad we had tonight will play juventus at old trafford on wednesday night with ryan giggs paul scholes and gary neville to come in
1261706 the lads know how important the game is on tuesday night so we just have to go out and play to our best
1261707 we battered them in the second half so if we look at that and go and play the same way theres no hesitation well win
1261708 everyone knows in the world how big a club rangers is and this game is massive for the club because it puts us through to the third round
1261709 if im involved i dont want to be in the game that puts us out of the champions league
1261710 everyone is going to be up for it and the gaffer will make sure everyones up for it
1261711 everyone knew how big a game the first leg against kaunas was and there was a lot of frustration among the players and the fans
1261712 but we have another game to put it right and im sure well go out and do it
1261713 we knew what kaunas would be like because this is european football and we just have to deal with that
1261714 it was a great result for them at ibrox but when we got the ball down and started passing it then i think everyone could see we were the better team were not worried about them because we know we can go out and beat them
1261715 the draw for the next round is definitely a good one for us but were not looking that far ahead we just need to see how this one goes
1261716 its all about what weve got to do this season and thats that
1261717 i just knew coming to rangers would give me a chance to play in the biggest competition in the world for club football
1261718 if we dont make it well just have to get on with it and win the spl and more trophies
1261719 we dine well here in camelot we eat ham and jam and spam a lot

1261804 i love spending time with my boy but lets face it there are times when you just have to have 10 minutes or so to yourself so that you can wash the dishes or do laundry thats when you pop this video in its 25 minutes of entertainment that holds the attention of even very young children

1261838 i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1261839 the value of the additional equity will be reflected in the sale price for northern rock on return to the private sector which will reduce public sector net debt at the point of sale

1261843 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1261844 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1261845 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1261846 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1261847 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1261848 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
1261849 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1261850 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1261851 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1261852 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1261853 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1261854 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1261855 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1261856 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1261857 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1261858 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november

1261864 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1261865 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1261866 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1261867 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today

1261871 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1261872 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1261873 absolutely because in june a month before he said and did i mention that theyre going to say hes black john mccain doesnt have a racist bone in his body and theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1261874 and you also suggest hes going to say the way hes going to get elected is to talk about your name the way you look and john mccain doesnt want to get elected on that so the idea hes not interjecting race quite frankly is not credible we went through this in south carolina john has an adopted daughter from bangladesh on the right they said john mccain had an illegitimate black daughter now without john doing one thing theyre suggesting that obama is a victim of john mccain interjecting he looks funny and sounds funny were not going to put up with this to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
1261875 so thats what he was saying just that hes younger
1261876 no no no he has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist hes never said anything that he was using race in this effort you cant quote him you cant find him saying that what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate and where the mccain campaign couldnt get any traction on the issues they go after him personally they go after him as a person who really doesnt fit the political mold
1261877 no what he was saying is theyre trying to scare you theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that they are engaged in character assassination even john mccains partner in a number of initiatives in the senate russ feingold said yesterday theyve decided they cant win on the issues so now theyre going to try to destroy his character and that is exactly what this ad is calculated to do
1261878 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president when you use the expressions that senator obama did three times this week youre making a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain ive been with him for 20 years private and public this man does not have a bigoted bone in his body his wife and he adopted a baby from bangladesh who they love its just wrong for senator obama to have done that it was right for the campaign to call him on it
1261879 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1261880 given the tenure of the mccain camps attacks on senator obama i can understand senator obama saying that senator obama wants to run as much as he can from a campaign thats focused only on race
1261881 john mccain has worked over time to keep race out of this campaign and to keep the focus on issues this is not the first time that the race card has been played by the obama campaign bill clinton even said that the race card was played on him in south carolina and now the mccain campaign is saying look you introduced the whole notion of race
1261882 what he basically said as i understand it and i think this is right is that theres a lot in there that he thinks could be constructive and if it means doing something that he has a lot of reservations about in order to accomplish something much larger thats constructive then thats the way a legislative process should work in a democracy thats how he would act as a president which is to move forward and to work with the people who disagree with him to find measures that he thinks makes sense
1261883 what senator obama said is what we want a president to say lets look at all of the options lets compare them
1261884 barack obama has always been in favor of offshore drilling but what he said is lets use first the 68 million acres that are already out there there is absolutely no reason why we cant begin where weve already got an opportunity
1261885 its typical you know every once in a while we see him playing basketball
1261886 i hope that senator obama will change his mind about offshore drilling but this issue of whether or not hes a leader this is a good test were out of session were out of business on energy when we should be in session doing the american peoples business pick up the phone and tell nancy pelosi who says offshore drilling is a hoax harry reid who says drilling is a red herring call the congress back in session hes the leader of the party youre a great guy you know all these people lets get the congress back in session
1261887 you know there really isnt a significant shift whats happened here is that a bipartisan group of senators has come together with a comprehensive paid for plan on energy and this plan includes some additional offshore oil drilling what senator obama has said is he welcomes the plan he welcomes working with the senators he welcomes their energy summit in september so this is a great opportunity for working together with a bipartisan group
1261888 senator obama is only in this position now because it became patently obvious over the last weeks particularly when nancy pelosi turned off the lights in the house of representatives and republican members refused to leave she had an insurrection in her own party because pelosi and reid at obamas behest were refusing to move forward on drilling so he is now trying to get credit for being all of the above energy planner
1261889 he still believes we should not drill offshore what hes prepared to do is break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels and an energy policy thats comprehensive i think what you see in the response on this drilling is really the difference in how they might govern
1261890 i predict to you hell find reasons not to be for it if this comes to a vote in the senate
1261891 because the misrepresentation has been made that this is going to reduce the price at the pump this is again a decoy its not a solution
1261892 you never say never to anything people have their parliamentary options available to them
1261893 ive enjoyed working with senator mccain as he serves in the united states senate and i look forward to continuing to do that
1261894 he says when hes president he can work with you the way that ronald reagan worked with tip oneill
1261895 well i look forward to working with barack obama but stand ready to work with any president of the united states
1261896 im worried that this approach is not worthy of the office of president that senator mccain and senator obama are running for for senator mccain to demean the race for the presidency in this way is i think not humorous i think its silly
1261897 i support anyone that senator obama is comfortable with for vice president i didnt want to see a discussion of candidates for vice president without showing the house of representatives chet edwards for years our colleagues have said to him why dont you run for president he is an extraordinarily talented person he is a champion for veterans in the congress under his leadership we have passed including just on friday the biggest increase in funding for veterans health benefits and other benefits in the history of our country hes a master of needs of our military and their families he understands the issues of nonproliferation he has been a champion in the appropriations committee and the congress hes from south texas he represents president bush in the congress
1261898 well i would certainly hope so but you know what senator dodd senator biden senator hillary clinton theres such a great array of people from whom senator obama can choose so any one of them im fine with i just wanted people to be aware of the extraordinary credentials of chet edwards and i hope he will be the nominee
1261899 they have not and im always honored to be mentioned im proud to be campaigning for this incredibly bright man who is going the change course in this country but i think that all the speculation is going to come to an end soon because at least were going to get choices before too long
1261900 i dont honestly know i talked to barack about it this weekend you know what he did he just smiled
1261901 im supporting senator mccaskill on the democrats side after her feisty performance today i think shed be great for senator obama
1261902 no i think the whole vp thing is a little bit overrated its important but maybe the media is giving it a little bit more importance than it deserves the key is whos at the top of the ticket
1261903 youre pro choice and mccain says because of that even though he likes you a lot it would be difficult to name you as vice president take us inside the room if senator mccain says you know this is the difficulty i have otherwise i want you what do you say to him
1261904 well john and i have been friends for 25 years and i know this issue is very important to john its obviously very important to probably the majority of the men and women in the republican party and i dont think john would ever make it a litmus test but when it comes down to a nominee selecting a vice presidential running mate it is their decision exclusively and i would respect their decision one way or the other
1261905 john is not judgmental on the issue he feels very strongly about it will always feel strongly about it as the majority of the party but i have had that point of view before i got into politics i had it when i was in politics and i preserve that point of view now so inside the room i listen to my friend and be quite comfortable with any decision he made because he would make it for the right reason
1261906 ill have that private conversation with my friend john and then perhaps report back to you
1261907 the fact is he is black and he is injecting race its a way to make people more comfortable its the elephant in the room perhaps he misspoke a little bit but i dont think he accused john mccain of being a racist or running a racist campaign clearly he has sought to inject race in a healthy way and hes done it time and time again
1261908 if you can define him as the black guy in the race its to his detriment i think obama is fearful of this but the way that he put it in mccains mouth i think it was a huge mistake by barack obama because barack obama doesnt want to bring up race in that way he wants to be the unifier he doesnt want to remind them that hes the black guy in the race so he did play the race card mccain responded and i think responded fairly
1261909 theres a lot of danger in this for barack obama it cuts both ways but most of the negatives go to him its all about his response he has to have sort of a light touch on this if he comes off looking angry then that could be to the benefit of other candidates it sort of happened in tennessee with harold ford another telegenic african american candidate who found himself in the position of taking in these racial charges and responding in a slightly angry way the voters didnt like that and it turned out to be a big problem for him he lost
1261910 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1261911 i think that was an off the cuff remark i think he was but i dont think he meant to do it and i dont think it would be helpful for him to do it the american people dont like being called racist i think they consider race a tough and sacred issue which they want touched in an intelligent way they do not want it touched in the heat of a political campaign in my view whoever raises the race issue is going to hurt themselves
1261912 this week expect that well see some face to faces between obama and some of these prospective candidates joe biden and evan bayh apparently will have some face time at some point this week hell be out in indiana and so were trying to figure out where joe biden is going to be meeting him
1261913 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1261914 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1261915 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1261916 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1261917 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1261918 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1261919 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1261920 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1261921 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1261922 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1261923 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1261924 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1261925 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1261926 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1261927 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1261928 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1261929 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1261930 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1261931 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1261932 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1261933 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1261934 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1261935 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1261936 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1261937 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1261938 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1261939 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1261940 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1261941 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1261942 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1261943 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1261944 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1261945 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1261946 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1261947 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1261948 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1261949 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1261950 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1261951 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1261952 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1261953 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1261954 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1261955 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1261956 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1261957 aons an obsolescence detection and notification service for web archives and digital repositories
1261958 my life is like an air traffic controllers moments of boredom broken up by moments of sheer terror
1261959 so why wasnt i doing so when i could have been
1261960 the paragraphs are formatted like list items but they do not have a preceding number or bullet
1261961 one thing i have always dreamed to be possible is that when i write a doc in koffice i can then open it in ooo to use that one feature thats useful to me and then save it and continue in koffice without loosing lots of data

1261970 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
1261971 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
1261972 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
1261973 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1261974 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1261975 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
1261976 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
1261977 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1261978 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1261979 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1261980 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1261981 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1261982 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1261983 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1261984 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1261985 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1261986 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1261987 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1261988 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1261989 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1261990 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1261991 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1261992 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1261993 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1261994 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1261995 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1261996 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1261997 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1261998 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1261999 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1262000 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1262001 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1262002 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
1262003 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
1262004 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1262005 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1262006 last time i put him outside the wind blew his cage over
1262007 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
1262008 there are several different ways of working for god as mr taylor reminded the little company
1262009 praise be to you allah a praising that combines the praises of all of your creation for what you have blessed me with and preferred me greatly over many of those whom you have created
1262010 for what blessing are you praising allah for what preference are you thanking him for by allah i do not see any type of difficulty except that you are experiencing it
1262011 do you not see what has happened to me by allah if he were to cause the heavens to rain fire down upon me and i were to be burned up because of it and he were to command the mountains to crush me and he were to command the oceans to drown me i would not increase except in praising and thanks to him and i request something of you i have a daughter who used to serve me and break my fast with me can you see if you can find her
1262012 by allah i hope that in fulfilling the request of this pious servant i will gain nearness to allah the mighty and majestic
1262013 to allah we belong and to him we return how will i tell this pious servant that his daughter had died
1262014 are you better in the sight of allah than prophet ayyub allah put him to trial with his wealth and his children and family
1262015 well the daughter that you had asked me to find i found that she has been eaten by wild beasts
1262016 praise be to allah who has taken me out of this world without putting in my heart any love for it
1262017 to allah we belong and to him we return who will help me to wash his body and bury it
1262018 how did you reach your current state of health and happiness
1262019 you will see after me selfishness on the part of other people and other matters that you will disapprove of
1262020 what do you order us to do o allahs apostle under such circumstances
1262021 pay their rights to them to the rulers and ask your right from allah
1262022 either someone will buy who wants a tenant or if someone who buys the home wants to move in i will move out without a fight
1262023 but i am taking stand based on principle that i will not move out without a fight as long as the bank owns the property
1262024 their the banks accumulation of property is growing week by week
1262025 this is clearly a case where the bank doesnt care what happens to a neighborhood
1262026 they cant afford the bad press so they decided not to show up
1262027 without a doubt i think our actions helped to get that vote
1262028 the concept of directly connecting soil being able to produce plants to the potential of women to give birth and vice versa and to think that the fertility of the female body depends on the fertility of the earth constitutes the oldest and most essential core of the tantric belief system
1262029 an active attitude which interacts with nature as a living being and a contemplative and passive attitude which relies on the guidance of a higher being

1262031 ketikamana allah telah mencampakkan islam di dalam hatiku aku telah pergi menghadap nabi sallallahu alaihi wassalam lalu aku telah berkata kepada beliau tadahkanlah tangan kananmu kerana aku ingin membaiah kepadamu berjanji taat setia kepada baginda lalu baginda nabi pun menadah tangan kanan beliau lalu aku pun menggenggam tanganku lalu baginda pun berkata kenapakah dengan kamu wahai amru lalu aku pun berkata kepada beliau aku ingin membuat syarat baginda pun bertanya kembali kamu mahu mensyaratkan apa aku pun berkata aku mahu diampunkan baginda pun berkata apakah kamu tidak tahu wahai amru bahawa sesungguhnya islam itu bakal menghapuskan segala perkara yang terdahulu sesungguhnya hijrah itu bakal menghapuskan segala perkara sebelumnya dan haji itu pula bakal menghapuskan segala perkara sebelumnya

1262034 daripada abi said saad bin malik al khudri radiallahu anhu sesungguhnya nabi sallallahu alaihi wassalam telah berkata sesungguhnya ada seorang lelaki yang hidup di zaman sebelum kalian yang telah membunuh 99 jiwa maka dia telah bertanya untuk berjumpa dengan orang yang paling alim di atas dunia ini dan dia telah ditunjukkan kepada seorang rahib maka dia pun datang kepada rahib tersebut lalu berkata bahawa dia telah membunuh 99 jiwa manusia apakah ada padanya taubat maka rahib itu pun berkata tidak ada taubat bagimu maka lelaki itu pun membunuh si rahib itu lalu mencukupkan 100 jiwa manusia telah dia bunuh lalu dia bertanya lagi tentang orang yang paling alim di atas dunia ini lalu dia ditunjukkan kepada seorang alim lalu berkata yang dia telah membunuh 100 orang manusia apakah ada padanya taubat lalu alim itu berkata ya ada padamu taubat dan siapakah yang bakal menghalangmu dari bertaubat pergilah kau ke suatu tempat sekian dan sekian kerana di sana adanya golongan manusia yang menyembah allah taala maka pergilah kau menyembah allah bersama mereka dan janganlah kau kembali lagi ke tempat kau kerana tempat kau itu adalah tempat yang buruk keadaanya maka bertolaklah lelaki tersebut ke tempat yang dikatakan alim tersebut ketikamana dia sampai di pertengahan jalan maut pun datang menjemputnya maka berbalahlah malaikat rahmat dan malaikat azab maka berkatalah malaikat rahmat dia datang dengan keadaan yang bertaubat yang menghadap hatinya kepada allah taala dan berkata pula malaikat azab sesunggunya dia tidak langsung membuat perkara kebajikkan tiba tiba datanglah malaikat malik yang menjelma dalam keadaan seorang manusia lalu menjadi hakim di antara mereka dan berkata ukurlah kalian di antara dua tempat ini dan kearah manakah di antara kedua tempat ini dia berdekatan maka disitulah tempatnya maka para malaikat tersebut pun mengukur dan mereka mendapati mayat lelaki tersebut lebih dekat ke tempat yang ingin ditujuinya itu lalu malaikat rahmat pun mengambil lelaki tersebut
1262035 dan orang orang yang tidak mempersekutukan allah dengan sembahan lain dan tidak membunuh orang yang diharamkan allah kecuali dengan alasan yang benar dan tidak berzina dan barangsiapa yang melakukan demikian itu nescaya dia mendapat hukuman yang berat yakni akan dilipat gandakan azab untuknya pada hari qiamat dan dia akan kekal dalam azab itu dalam keadaan terhina kecuali orang orang yang bertaubat dan beriman dan mengerjakan kebajikkan maka kejahatan mereka digantikan allah dengan kebaikkan allah maha pengampun maha penyayang dan barangsiapa bertaubat dan mengerjakan kebajikkan maka sesungguhnya dia bertaubat kepada allah dengan sebenar benar taubat
1262036 dari abdur rahman bin jabir daripada abi thowil telah datang seorang tua yang sangat tua sehinggakan dahinya telah menutup kedua belah matanya dan dia bertopang menggunakan tongkat sehinggalah dia menghadap nabi sallallahu alaihi wassalam lalu berkata apakah pandanganmu tentang seorang lelaki yang berbuat berbagai jenis dosa dan tidaklah dia meninggalkan apa dosa pun untuk dilakukanya walau kecil jua yang besar semuanya dia lakukan yang mana jikalau dosa dosanya itu dibahagi bahagikan kepada penghuni dunia ini akan hancurlah mereka maka adakah untuknya taubat
1262037 dari urwah bin zubair sesungguhnya hakim bin hizam telah memberitahunya bahawa dia telah berkata kepada rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wassalam wahai rasulullah apakah pandanganmu terhadap perkara perkara ibadatku ketika aku masih jahiliyah seperti sedeqah kepada faqir miskin merdekakan hamba mengeratkan silaturrahim apakah ada padanya pahala berkatanya nabi engkau telah menerima pada apa yang telah engkau lakukan dahulu daripada kebaikkan
1262038 dari abu bakar radiallahu anhu berkata aku telah mendengar rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wassalam bersabda tidaklah seorang lelaki itu yang melakukan dosa kemudianya bangun dan membersihkan diri berwudhuk kemudian bersolat solat taubat dua rakaat kemudianya meminta ampun kepada allah dengan beristighfar melainkan akan diampunkan allah baginya kemudian beliau membaca ayat ini
1262039 aku telah membuat berbagai amalan soleh sebagai menghapuskan kesalahanku tersebut
1262040 sesungguhnya perumpamaan orang yang melakukan kejahatan kejahatan kemudianya melakukan kebaikkan kebaikkan seperti seorang lelaki yang memakai baju perang besi yang sempit sehingga mencekiknya kemudianya apabila dia membuat amalan kebaikkan maka terbukalah suatu lubang kemudian dia melakukan kebaikkan yang lain dan terbukalah lubang yang lain sehinggalah terbuka kesemuanya dan jatuh ke atas tanah
1262041 telah datang seorang lelaki kepada nabi sallallahu alaihi wasalam lalu berkata wahai rasulullah sesungguhnya aku telah bertemu dengan seorang perempuan di suatu kebun dan aku telah melakukan perbuatan terkutuk dengan perempuan tersebut cuma aku hanya tidak menyetubuhi perempuan tersebut aku telah menciumnya dan memeluknya dan aku tidak melakukan selain perbuatan tersebut maka buatlah sesuka hatimu terhadapku tetapi rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wassalam tidak berkata apa apa lalu lelaki itu pun pergi lalu berkatanya umar sesungguhnya allah telah menutupi keaiban lelaki itu jika dia menutupi keaiban dirinya sendiri maka rasulullah pun memandangnya lalu berkata kembalikan dia kepadaku lelaki itu pun dipanggil semula kepada baginda lalu baginda membacakan ayat
1262042 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh dalam kehidupan didunia dan di akhirat dan allah menyesatkan orang orang yang zalim dan allah berbuat apa yang dia kehendakki tidakkah kamu memperhatikan orang orang yang telah menukar nikmat allah dengan engkar kepada allah dan menjatuhkan kaumnya ke lembah kebinasaan iaitu neraka jahanam mereka masuk ke dalamnya dan itulah seburuk buruk tempat kediaman
1262043 amma badu sesungguhnya telah sampai berita kepadaku bahawa para sahabatmu telah memulaukanmu dan allah tidak akan meletakkanmu dalam kehinaan dan kesia siaan maka adalah lebih baik pada kami menyertai bersama kamu
1262044 maka aku telah berkata ketikamana daku membaca surat tersebut dan ini juga adalah suatu bala ujian maka aku pun membakar surat tersebut
1262045 maka bersabarlah engkau sungguh janji janji allah itu benar dan sekali kali jangan sampai orang yang tidak meyakini kebenaran ayat ayat allah itu mengelisahkan engkau
1262046 dia ibrahim berkata tidak ada yang berputus asa dari rahmat tuhanya kecuali orang yang sesat
1262047 dan apabila engkau di tanya dari hamba hambaku tentang aku maka sesungguhnya aku dekat aku memenuhi permintaan orang yang meminta apabila berdoa
1262048 barangsiapa diberi petunjuk oleh allah maka dialah yang mendapat petunjuk dan barangsiapa yang disesatkanya maka engkau tidak akan mendapatkan seorang penolong yang dapat memberikan petunjuk kepadanya
1262049 barangsiapa yang mempunyai kezaliman terhadap saudaranya iaitu yang berupa maruah atau harta benda maka mintalah kepadanya agar di halalkan perkara perkara tersebut cepat cepat sebelum diambil daripadanya di hari tiadanya dinar juga dirham qiyamat yang mana pada hari itu jika dia mempunyai amalan soleh maka akan diambil daripada amalan tersebut sekadar kezaliman yang dilakukanya jika dia tidak mempunyai apa apa amalan soleh maka akan di ambil pula kejahatan kejahatan orang yang dizaliminya itu lalu di berikan kepadanya

1262051 dan janganlah kamu bertolong tolongan di dalam perkara dosa dan permusuhan
1262052 dari abi huraiah radiallahu anhu berkata rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wassalam telah berkata allah azza wajalla pula telah berkata bahawa aku pada sangkaan hambaku dan aku bersamanya ketika dia mengingatiku demi allah allah lebih gembira dengan taubat hambanya melebihi kegembiraan salah seorang dari kalian yang menjumpai barang yang hilang di bumi yang tandus dan barangsiapa yang mendekatiku sejengkal maka aku akan mendekatinya sehasta dan barangsiapa yang mendekatiku sehasta maka aku akan mendekatinya pula sedepa dan jika dia datang kepadaku dengan berjalan aku akan datang pula kepadanya dengan belari lari anak
1262053 diriwayatkan daripada abu hurairah r a katanya nabi sallallahu alaihi wassalam bersabda tentang apa yang baginda terima dari allah s w t katanya seorang hamba allah melakukan dosa lalu berdoa wahai tuhanku ampunkanlah dosaku allah s w t berfirman hambaku telah melakukan dosa tetapi dia tahu bahawa dia mempunyai tuhan yang akan mengampunkan dosa atau menghukumnya kerana melakukan dosa kemudian hamba allah tersebut kembali melakukan dosa lalu berdoa wahai tuhanku ampunkanlah dosaku allah s w t berfirman hambaku melakukan dosa tetapi dia tahu bahawa dia mempunyai tuhan yang akan mengampunkan dosa atau menghukumnya kerana melakukan dosa kemudian hamba allah tersebut kembali melakukan dosa lalu berdoa wahai tuhanku ampunkanlah dosaku allah s w t berfirman hambaku melakukan dosa tetapi dia tahu bahawa dia mempunyai tuhan yang akan mengampunkan dosa atau menghukumnya kerana melakukan dosa oleh itu buatlah sesuka hatimu aku akan ampunkan dosamu hamba tersebut berkata aku tidak tahu sehingga kali ketiga atau keempat aku meminta keampunan tetapi allah s w t tetap berfirman buatlah sesuka hatimu aku tetap akan mengampunkan dosamu
1262054 dari anas radiallahu anhu berkata aku telah mendengar rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wassalam berkata bekatanya allah subhanahu wa taala wahai anak adam
1262055 dan bertaubatlah kamu sekalian kepada allah hai orang orang yang beriman supaya kamu beruntung
1262056 dan mereka menjadikan malaikat malaikat yang mereka itu adalah hamba hamba allah yang maha pemurah sebagai orang orang perempuan apakah mereka menyaksikan penciptaan malaika malaikat itu kelak akan dituliskan persaksian mereka dan mereka akan dimintai pertanggung jawaban
1262057 sesungguhnya orang orang yang tiada beriman kepada kehidupan akhirat mereka benar benar menamakan malaikat itu dengan nama perempuan
1262058 tiada suatu ucapan pun yang diucapkannya melainkan ada di dekatnya malaikat pengawas yang selalu hadir
1262059 our house because we dont have to sleep on the side of the street like some people do
1262060 family because i have people to live with they love me and they take care of me
1262061 friends because its somebody to play with and just to have somebody to talk to
1262062 our dog because we have somebody to play with when we go outside

1262067 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1262068 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1262069 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1262070 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1262071 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1262072 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1262073 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1262074 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1262075 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1262076 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1262077 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1262078 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1262079 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1262080 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1262081 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1262082 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1262083 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1262084 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1262085 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1262086 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1262087 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1262088 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1262089 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1262090 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1262091 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1262092 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1262093 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1262094 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1262095 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1262096 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1262097 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1262098 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1262099 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1262100 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1262101 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1262102 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1262103 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1262104 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1262105 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1262106 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1262107 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of 1 a gallon gasoline
1262108 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1262109 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1262110 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1262111 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1262112 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1262113 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1262114 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1262115 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1262116 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1262117 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1262118 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
1262119 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
1262120 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
1262121 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
1262122 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
1262123 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
1262124 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
1262125 once again we have an opportunity to take a giant leap for humankind
1262126 when we send money to foreign countries to buy nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs when we spend that money building solar arrays and windmills we build competitive industries and gain jobs here at home
1262127 i have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll taxes with the difference made up in co2 taxes we should tax what we burn not what we earn this is the single most important policy change we can make
1262128 we must recognize those who have toiled in dangerous conditions to bring us our present energy supply we should guarantee good jobs in the fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced by impacts on the coal industry
1262129 in recent years our politics has tended toward incremental proposals made up of small policies designed to avoid offending special interests alternating with occasional baby steps in the right direction our democracy has become sclerotic at a time when these crises require boldness
1262130 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil 10 years from now
1262131 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness the other to total extinction let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly
1262132 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1262133 says he has all the answers and it will only cost 3 trillion
1262134 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1262135 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1262136 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1262137 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1262138 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and keep the pressure on this enemy and bring em to justice so they dont hurt the american citizen again
1262139 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1262140 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1262141 that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1262142 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1262143 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1262144 at john mccains campaign you cant spit without hitting a big money lobbyist who is raising money for or staffing his campaign mccainslobbyists com shows just how much mccain is embedded in and wedded to the old web of corruption in washington dc
1262145 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1262146 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1262147 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1262148 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1262149 inflation is intensifying and that is the main source of weakness in consumer spending
1262150 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1262151 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1262152 unlike obama in illinois sen hillary clinton voted to support the 2002 federal bill
1262153 in fact the bill passed the senate 98 to 0 with pro abortion senators like boxer d ca and reid d nv supporting it
1262154 deal hudson has been one of the leading proponents of this language thats very corrosive
1262155 his rhetoric has been corrosive for catholic values with these broadside attacks that are disingenuous and unethical the parallel would be to say mccain wants children to die of infectious diseases because he voted against s chip
1262156 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
1262157 the congress doing nothing decided to go on a five week recess said mccain
1262158 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1262159 es ist das beste und aufregendste was ich je in meinem leben gemacht habe f r mich ist ein traum wahr geworden das ergebnis meines musikvideos hat mich sehr begeistert das gesamte team hat meine pers nliche erwartung weit bertroffen und ich freue mich jetzt schon auf eine aufregende zeit am set mit meiner auserw hlten die arbeit am zweiten song hat bereits begonnen und wer wei vielleicht wird hollywood auf meine einzigartige idee aufmerksam
1262160 wenn ich mich neu verliebe dann nur in jemanden der sich nicht in den vordergrund dr ngt
1262161 vater sein ist die sch nste aufgabe die ich mir vorstellen kann f r mich ist es das gr te gl ck den jungen aufwachsen zu sehen und ihn so gro zuziehen dass ich sagen kann so ist es gut
1262162 wenn ich beruflich unterwegs bin habe ich meist ein schlechtes gewissen
1262163 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1262164 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1262165 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1262166 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1262167 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1262168 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1262169 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1262170 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1262171 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1262172 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1262173 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1262174 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1262175 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1262176 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1262177 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1262178 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1262179 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1262180 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1262181 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1262182 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1262183 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1262184 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1262185 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1262186 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1262187 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1262188 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1262189 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1262190 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1262191 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1262192 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1262193 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1262194 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1262195 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1262196 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1262197 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1262198 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1262199 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1262200 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1262201 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1262202 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1262203 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1262204 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1262205 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1262206 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1262207 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1262208 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1262209 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1262210 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1262211 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1262212 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1262213 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction

1262237 you know its not about you its about your country
1262238 we will not back down we will not slow down we are in this for the long haul
1262239 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd
1262240 i salute him for that challenge it is absolutely possible to do so
1262241 i think nuclear will play a role i dont think it will be a large increase
1262242 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
1262243 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1262244 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
1262245 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
1262246 the issues were put on the table and the ioc requested that the olympic games hosts address them we understand that bocog will give details to the media very soon of how the matter has been addressed we trust them to keep their promise the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into

1262324 mr lowe we are told treats in a very enlightened manner of the fluctuations in the value of money and proceeds to propound a scheme probably invented by him for giving a steady value to money contracts he proposes that persons should be appointed to collect authentic information concerning the prices at which the staple articles of household consumption were sold in regard to corn and sugar authoritative returns were then and have ever since been published in the london gazette and there seemed to be no difficulty in extending a like system to other articles having regard to the comparative quantities of commodities consumed in a household he would then frame a table of reference showing in what degree a money contract must be varied so as to make the purchasing power uniform in principle the scheme seems to be perfectly sound but lowe did not attempt to work out the practical details and his plan involves needless difficulties a very similar scheme was independently proposed about eleven years later by mr g poulett scrope the well known writer on geology and political economy in a very able but now forgotten pamphlet called an examination of the bank charter question with an inquiry into the nature of a just standard of value

1262336 its one of the oldest spiritual traditions in the world
1262337 its based on the teachings of bhagavad gita which was spoken by lord krsna five thousand years ago
1262338 did you know the mayan calendar ends on december 21 2012 some people say a cataclysmic event at that time will cause the end of the world
1262339 but the bhagavad gita is more authoritative and doesnt mention that the world will come to an end then

1262347 just at that moment you were beginning your lecture on the stage i told him to go outside the tent and listen when you finished he came back in and said with a smile i learned the prayer i wanted thank you i gave him a set of japa beads and he was chanting on them even as he left
1262348 i want to thank you for giving my daughter this sari onstage last night
1262349 she was one of the girls who won the dancing competition when we got home she insisted on sleeping in it this morning we had to wash it as she wanted to wear it again today but as you can imagine my wife and i had no idea how to dress our little girl in six meters of cloth i even went on the internet to search for a method eventually we managed i was supposed to return to work in warsaw today but my daughter cried so much and insisted that we come for the wedding that i called in sick and here we are
1262350 you cant let them do this theyre not purified it will ruin the yajna
1262351 its impossible just take it as another installment of lord caitanyas mercy

1262354 when planning a trip i always check on the reviews and satisfaction levels of other customers and then i also blog about my experiences so others can plan their trips this is the future of travel
1262355 ugc has a cultural context to it for example indians tend to travel in groups of four and above and they are seeking very different experiences compared with westerners you may thus want to visit sites where your unique needs are addressed
1262356 i have tried referring to sites like oktatabyebye com but the reviews can be misleading or biased sometimes for instance one review strongly dissuaded me from visiting the small seaside town of guhaghar for reasons including bad food at the resort the reviewer stayed at but i still visited the town and found it to be very nice with good clean beaches
1262357 i get a good sense of a place by reading reviews from people who have been there i have found such content to be useful guiding points to what to look for
1262358 its worse when there are half baked reviews on halfbaked sites
1262359 smaller hotels are beginning to realise the value of such reviews
1262360 we are trying to build trust with the travel trade too and telling them we have no axe to grind when we allow user content to go up on our site we invite them to react to reviews but they have yet to start doing so
1262361 it is worth while to remark that a product is no sooner created than it from that instance affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value when the producer has put the finishing hand to his product he is most anxious to sell it immediately lest its value should vanish in his hands nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it for the value of money is also perishable but the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other thus the mere circumstance of the creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products
1262362 but it may be asked if this be so how does it happen that there is at times so great a glut of commodities in the market and so much difficulty in finding a vent for them why cannot one of these 11 superabundant commodities be exchanged for another i answer that the glut of a particular commodity arises from its having outrun the total demand for it in one or two ways either because it has been produced in excessive abundance or because the production of other commodities has fallen short
1262363 no man produces but with a view to consume or sell and he never sells but with an intention to purchase some other commodity which may be immediately useful to him or which may contribute to future production by producing then he necessarily becomes either the consumer of his own goods or the purchaser and consumer of the goods of some other person productions are always bought by productions or by services money is only the medium by which the exchange is effected too much of a particular commodity may be produced of which there may be such a glut in the market as not to repay the capital expended on it but this cannot be the case with respect to all commodities
1262364 the idea that we can safely neglect the aggregate demand function is fundamental to the ricardian economics which underlie what we have been taught for more than a century malthus indeed had vehemently opposed ricardo s doctrine that it was impossible for elective demand to be deficient but vainly for since malthus was unable to explain clearly apart from an appeal to the facts of common observation how and why effective demand could be deficient or excessive he failed to furnish an alternative construction and ricardo conquered england as completely as the holy inquisition conquered spain not only was his theory accepted by the city by statesmen and by the academic world but controversy ceased the other point of view completely disappeared it ceased to be discussed the great puzzle of effective demand with which malthus had wrestled vanished from economic literature you will not find it mentioned even once in the whole works of marshall edgeworth and professor pigou from whose hands the classical theory has received its most mature embodiment it could only live on furtively below the surface in the underworlds of karl marx silvio gesell or major douglas but although the doctrine itself has remained unquestioned by orthodox economists up to a late date its signal failure for purposes of scientific prediction has greatly impaired in the course of time the prestige of its practitioners for professional economists after malthus were apparently unmoved by the lack of correspondence between the results of their theory and the facts of observation a discrepancy which the ordinary man has not failed to observe with the result of his growing unwillingness to accord to economists that measure of respect which he gives to other groups of scientists whose theoretical results are confirmed by observation when they are applied to the facts the celebrated optimism of traditional economic theory which has led to economists being looked upon as candides who having left this world for the cultivation of their gardens teach that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds provided we will let well alone is also to be traced i think to their having neglected to take account of the drag on prosperity which can be exercised by an insufficiency of effective demand for there would obviously be a natural tendency towards the optimum employment of resources in a society which was functioning after the manner of the classical postulates it may well be that the classical theory represents the way in which we should like our economy to behave but to assume that it actually does so is to assume our difficulties away

1262380 la gente me ha preguntado que contienen esas leyes cual es la intenci n del gobierno yo les he explicado que estas leyes salieron a ultima hora nadie conoce su contenido y todos nos sentimos extra ados porque no se sabe para donde va esto cual es la intenci n es aprovecharse y abusar de una ley habilitante que ten a 18 mese y que en el ltimo d a meten todo corriendo todo apresurado como cuando a los muchachos le raspan ocho materias y las quiere pasar todas en reparaci n algo as esta haciendo el gobierno ch vez ha tenido tres habilitantes pero lo de esta ltima ya es una groser a
1262381 no sabemos que hay en esas leyes lo nico es que se van a publicar alg n d a en una gaceta extraordinaria lo l gico y lo sano despu s de 18 meses es que haya aparecido cada texto de las leyes se habla de una ley de seguridad social pero no sabemos su contenido y lo que nos angustia a todos los venezolanos es precisamente el no saber para donde vamos con estos decretos ley ojala sean en beneficio para todos
1262382 lo que retrata son los niveles de ineficiencia am n del contenido de los decretos leyes que no pueden ser analizados porque no se conocen sus contenidos
1262383 es inconcebible que habiendo pr cticamente la asamblea nacional autodeterminado su cierre t cnico mediante una delegaci n legislativa absoluta y total y un tiempo que no se le hab a dado a ninguno de los presidentes anteriores que gozaron de poderes extraordinarios no fueron capaces de legislar durante diez y ocho meses y mediante un procedimiento expedito
1262384 se habla de que quieren materializarla no puede ser pasada de contrabando porque al intentar esto entra en evidente contradicci n con la constituci n y tiene que ser objeto de lo que se llama el control de la constitucionalidad tm es decir que todo aquello que colida con el texto constitucional es inconstitucional
1262385 el bolivarianismo en teor a nos arropa a todos solo que como lo ha planteado hugo ch vez es una manipulaci n infame del nombre y el legado de nuestro libertador y lo utiliza como instrumento de un proyecto que es la negaci n de bol var de querer imponerle a los venezolanos a supresi n de las libertades el autoritarismo y de quedarse en la presidencia para siempre

1262429 neem die zaak ina post het bewijs bestond daar kort samengevat uit een lijk het feit dat de verdachte op de dag van het overlijden daar werkte en het feit dat ze bekende dat was het hele bewijs er was verder geen enkel technisch bewijs waaruit bleek dat zij die moord ook feitelijk pleegde een zwakte van ons stelsel is dat de rechter zelf keuzes mag maken uit het aanwezige bewijs en ook stukjes bewijs weg mag laten
1262430 ja er moeten minimaal twee zogeheten bewijsmiddelen zijn zoals verklaringen documenten of testuitslagen maar die hoeven elkaar niet te overlappen er is bijvoorbeeld een arrest van de hoge raad over het bezorgen van een dreigbrief waarvan alleen werd vastgesteld dat die brief op de deurmat lag en de verdachte in die straat toen post bezorgde klaar je kunt zo met beperkte bewijsmiddelen toch tot een veroordeling komen dat heeft de hoge raad al in 1926 goed gevonden e n bewijsmiddel met aanvullend bewijs is genoeg die zwakte is ingebouwd daar kun je heel kritisch over zijn maar zon systeem is echt nodig bij seksuele delicten daar heb je doorgaans alleen verklaringen van slachtoffer en verdachte stel dat het slachtoffer een blauwe plek heeft en een verdachte aanwijst die combinatie wordt geaccepteerd door de rechter anders kun je zo iemand nooit aanpakken als er nou ook spermaonderzoek was dan heb je een hard gegeven die blauwe plek alleen zegt dat er iets gebeurd is niet dat hij het heeft gedaan dit type delicten heeft er mede toe geleid dat het strafrecht nog soepeler is geworden met bewijs

1262434 youve got to love libraries youve got to love books youve got to love poetry youve got to love everything about literature then you can pick the one thing you love most and write about it
1262435 jerome bettis the no 5 rusher in nfl history claims in a new book that he faked a knee injury during training camp in 2000 so the wouldnt cut him and install richard huntley as the starter
1262436 youve got to love libraries youve got to love books youve got to love poetry youve got to love everything about literature then you can pick the one thing you love most and write about it
1262437 nee dank u daar zitten veel te veel calorieen in
1262438 in het begin had ik het nog niet zo door omdat de naam van de opdrachtgever zelden expliciet werd vermeld
1262439 ik ben ook diegene geweest die een doorbraak in de zaak bolhaar heeft bewerkstelligd ik wist de ex vriendin van verdachte louis h op te sporen aan wie hij de moord op corina bolhaar en haar twee kinderen zou hebben opgebiecht
1262440 santema is vervolgens niet bij de pakken neer gaan zitten maar heeft zijn kwaliteiten direct ingezet voor een eigen onderzoeksbureau en daar mogen we blij om zijn want niet gehinderd door bureaucratische rompslomp levert hij als vanouds vakwerk af
1262441 bert santema is niet bij mij in dienst drijft een eigen vennootschap en heeft derhalve zijn eigen verantwoordelijkheid
1262442 maar het meeste werk doe ik zelf door observatie onderzoek
1262443 het is niet mijn bedoeling te vernietigen en te doden noch de mensen zwart te maken
1262444 om bepaalde schoften te verhinderen te volharden in hun gevaarlijke en ontoelaatbare houdingen
1262445 cant talk young girl have to go home to play potentia
1262446 man you could hit a giant penguin under there although that would be weird
1262447 i dont know it would probably match the whole whale theme she got going on
1262448 anyway i got to go play potentia see you later
1262449 oh not you to jamie is already a potentia zombie and trust me her look fits the part i cant believe you like that game too even old mrs turner likes the game whoever invented it probably plans to take over the world and no one will notice because they are to busy playing potentia
1262450 hello its not just a game its the best thing ever and everyone wants the power it has
1262451 fine go have fun being a zombie dont worry youll fit right it with the rest of the town
1262452 oh it is filled with zombies i would be surprised if scooby doo and the gang came here to solve the zombie mystery
1262453 ive already wasted like ten minuets of my life talking to you when i could be playing potentia
1262454 ever since this game came out our town looks like a ghost town
1262455 a ghost town huh maybe scooby doo and the gang should come check it out
1262456 ok thats true but personally i dont have time for games whats your excuse
1262457 i dont know i guess i dont want power im almost scared to see who gets it whats if someone bad gets the power and uses it to attack us or something
1262458 dont worry about that the game is smart it wont choose just anybody it will choose the right person it has a computer chip in it its like a robot and it even has a brain
1262459 wow you sure know a lot about the game even though youve never played it
1262460 im the mayor its my job to know everything how else would i be the worlds best mayor
1262461 anyway i got to go do mayor like business so ill see you later
1262462 wow your job must be easy now that you have no people to worry about they are all playing potentia
1262463 yes but im no trouble and i dont plan to start playing that game
1262464 just when you thought this town couldnt get any weirder
1262465 oh no not you too mom this game is dangerous it controls your mind
1262466 i know but i just wanted to see what all the fuss was about
1262467 so did you get the power are you the new queen of potentia
1262468 cause queen maggie i can see it now you can have a crown and live in a castle and with all the power you could fly around the world if you see superman up there in the sky say hi to him for me
1262469 no i didnt get chosen i didnt even get past the first level
1262470 mom come on what would you do with all that power anyway
1262471 i dont know but with power it would make life so much easier
1262472 i cant believe people including my friends would waste there time trying to get power they wouldnt even be able to control
1262473 oh she loves it and johnny too am i the only one in the world who doesnt want power
1262474 the game might as well be called power i mean thats really what its all about power
1262475 i dont know i think that name would be to obvious
1262476 yeah im sure that word would really catch on come on everybody lets go play rewop
1262477 oh and potentia is better i mean what does that even mean
1262478 what no im not your not italian your irish and english
1262479 wait my dad was or is or i dont know
1262480 i guess it would be cool to be a queen
1262481 but still who wants to be queen of a stupid game anyway is everyone going to treat whoever wins like actual royalty and what if no one wins then everyone is going to spend the rest of eternity trying to win and for nothing i wish that game was never invented
1262482 whoever becomes queen or king of potentia are they like going to be treated like royalty around the world
1262483 i dont know the game is spreading fast but no one knows how many more games they plan to make and once they do pick a queen or king the game will become useless
1262484 if it becomes useless no one will want it which means the company who sells it will not get anymore money so why would they ever want to pick a king or queen
1262485 it sounds like a scam to me and everyone has bought into it
1262486 yeah but the company doesnt control over who or when the winner is selected the game does so there is nothing they can do about it
1262487 no one knows they just appear in the stores and some reports have said they just appear at people houses which means whoevers making and selling the game is not in it for the money
1262488 the prototype came out a long time ago but the game itself came out about a year ago
1262489 why did it take so long for the real game to come out if the prototype came out so long ago
1262490 look i dont know ok you asking a lot of questions about a game you seem to hate
1262491 its just so weird it seems like theres a reason behind this game and its not money which it usually is
1262492 ya its nice to get away from money for a change
1262493 yeah but mom money and power go hand in hand
1262494 you should be worrying about it anyway go watch television
1262495 wow that sounds just like something a mother would say
1262496 come over to my house for a while you have probably already had dinner but come over for dessert
1262497 ok cool we are almost done with dinner so come over in like a half an hour
1262498 lets talk about the mayor he was acting weird today when i ran into him
1262499 what about him he is a good guy and amazing mayor he has really helped this town
1262500 ya but now that everyone is playing potentia what does he do with all his time
1262501 i really dont know but im sure its something important
1262502 well if you like him so much maybe you should date him
1262503 i cant he said to go in a half an hour
1262504 you dont have to worry about that the streets are clear they are all playing potentia
1262505 uh thank you for having me you know in your house
1262506 ok this is definitely not johnnys room it looks like an old mans room
1262507 i would have thought you had saw enough of me already
1262508 um most of the time but this is a lesson to always knock
1262509 well i would hope so and by the way young lady im not that old
1262510 look could you please tell me where johnnys room is
1262511 really thats who he is i was hoping he was more of an occasional visitor
1262512 ya i figured that since he has his own room
1262513 oh i wanted to see if he would do a duet with me
1262514 it was a mistake and ya i got to know him a little more than i wanted to in fact
1262515 uh your still playing that game cause i didnt come over here to watch you play
1262516 thanks but no thanks its not really my thing but lets go get dessert
1262517 wow that is so informative in case i forgot in the five seconds it took for the screen to come on that i was in fact playing potentia
1262518 stop with the sarcasm its a fun game and who knows maybe you will even be chosen for queen
1262519 yes it would be a tragedy to go a whole day without potentia
1262520 look this screen is flashing on every potentia game in the world
1262521 oh my god no this is a joke this is a sick joke
1262522 what no how could i possibly be ok i mean youre the queen of potentia this this cant be happening
1262523 right and your jealous because you wanted to be queen of potentia
1262524 this is not funny what are you going to do
1262525 im not going to do anything i dont want to be queen
1262526 well whether you like it or not you are queen and you cant say no you have to do this
1262527 look no offence to myself but im not exactly queen material
1262528 i know this is crazy i mean who is this girl
1262529 because god saw this as an opportunity to torture me which for some reason he finds very fun
1262530 thats not the reason gt he said as if he actually thought i thought that
1262531 maybe it was a mistake maybe it was supposed to be you
1262532 it is true but im not going to be queen i dont even want to be
1262533 mrs johnnys mom arent you going to go get that
1262534 there is a giant mob of people all around looking for you
1262535 oh my god its sounds like the whole town is there
1262536 bring out queen hailey is she really in their we want to see her
1262537 mom do i have to go to this i dont even want to be queen
1262538 yes you do have to go everyone is expecting you to be there since it is your ceremony as queen
1262539 look i only want good things for you and now you can have whatever life you want
1262540 yeah but i already know what my life is going to be like mom and its not good this power is going to take over my life
1262541 because power is like alcohol too much and it changes you
1262542 go get ready you have a big day today so go get dressed
1262543 why arent you more excited its a whole ceremony just for you a hundred people have come to honor you people would kill to be in your shoes
1262544 i have bigger things planned for my life than being king
1262545 come on we have to go ill tell you later
1262546 hello good people of fells it is me your mayor
1262547 here is who you have all been waiting for hailey happs your new queen
1262548 thank you everyone um i just want to say that i know all of your wanted to be queen or king of potentia but i am proud to be your queen
1262549 i will always try to honor you and be the queen this town and well country deserves
1262550 uh ya thats all i have to say so um tootles
1262551 i cant help but think it should be my office
1262552 please dont start that again i know you think its unfair that i won but suck it up
1262553 it is unfair i mean if it wasnt for me you never would have even played the game
1262554 look thats just the way it happened its not my fault
1262555 look dont yell at me ok im sorry your jealous but get over it already
1262556 oh yes everyone does dont you know what everyone says about you
1262557 they say you dont deserve it because you never wanted it people cried when you won some people wanted it more than anything in the world and that stupid game chooses the one person who never liked it to begin with
1262558 oh im sorry i didnt mean to take it from you
1262559 well look you cant just sit here you have a lot of stuff to do now that your queen its going to be a lot of work with all the interviews and tv appearances and you should try to help the world now that you have a lot of power and control a lot of people have high expectations for you and you dont want to let them down
1262560 ya i understand when i saw jamie she flipped out giving me tons of gifts and saying i would always be her best friend
1262561 well of course everyone wants to be your friend now
1262562 so uh the mayor seemed kind of mad about you in his office
1262563 yeah i know i dont think he likes me very much
1262564 i dont want to be queen and i never did i dont deserve this there is someone so much better out there than me for queen
1262565 i wasnt right i was just well being mean i wanted to make you feel bad because i felt bad
1262566 i cant believe this why did this have to happen our whole plan might be ruined
1262567 be quite we dont want her or anyone else to hear you
1262568 i dont know we will think of something we have worked to hard for our whole plan to be ruined
1262569 for right now though i think we should just leave
1262570 we better go or they will know we heard everything
1262571 i dont want to be queen and i dont deserve it and that man is right i am ruining everything
1262572 i dont know but it choose you for a reason
1262573 then im going to ask the person who created it
1262574 how no one knows who or where he is no one even knows where the games come from or who makes it the whole thing is a big mystery
1262575 it could be dangerous whoever makes the game has a lot of power
1262576 i have all the power in the world no one is going to go up against me
1262577 yeah but whoever makes the game obviously doesnt want to be found
1262578 maybe he is ashamed of making a stupid brain washing game
1262579 why would anyone be ashamed of making the coolest game ever
1262580 well you can ask him yourself when we find him
1262581 because i need a partner and jamie is to brain washed to be any help and you know you want to
1262582 yeah well you have all the power if he goes against me it will be like a lion against a mouse and i will be the mouse
1262583 we are going to do this ourselves and we cant tell anyone else we have no idea who could be involved and i dont want it to slip out ok
1262584 i have been thinking about how to find out where the games come from
1262585 we could wait in a window to see who brings them
1262586 i dont think that will work because no one will want to buy them now that i am queen
1262587 maybe we cant find out where the games came from but we can find out where the prototype came from
1262588 the prototype its the thing that comes out before the game to test how the game works they also help make sure no one can steal the games
1262589 every game does if we find out where the prototype came from we can go there and find out where the person who makes them is
1262590 ok how do we find out where the prototype came from
1262591 well thats it then prototypes have at least one difference than the real games so all we have to do is find someone whose has a potentia game that is different than all the others
1262592 it started good she said her game was different because it had a brown smudge on the screen that blocked your score for the game
1262593 the brown smudge turned out to be dried peanut butter making the game the same as all the others
1262594 because i dont want you two to start arguing every time you come over to my house
1262595 i have a lot of information on the game and prototype
1262596 it was 25 years ago when the prototype came out it wasnt very popular and it was not very different than the game today it even had the same name it was invented by a man about 30 years old he was a smart kid and very rich he lived in an old mansion everyone knew him because he handed out the games personally from his old mansion a few older people came but the game didnt really appeal to the younger folks
1262597 if it was invented 25 years ago how come it took so long for the real game to come out
1262598 the game stayed on the market for a little while and started to gain more popularity people began to realize how much power the game had people started getting obsessed with it it was like cigarettes once they started they couldnt stop
1262599 no one knows for sure but one night there was a loud explosion we quickly found out the man who had invented the games mansion had exploded someone put a bomb in it the big deal was all his prototypes and games had been stolen the man was furious and quickly hired private detectives to discover who was behind it
1262600 they never found out all of a sudden every prototype ever made had disappeared some were even stolen out of peoples houses people expected him to make the games again but he never did the man fled he was said to have left the country but no one knows if he is still alive
1262601 people expected the man who stole them to take all the power for himself but he never did the game had disappeared people wondered about it for a while but it was soon forgotten once the new game came out it was very different but still had the same power the one thing i can tell you about the game is whoever is making the games today is not the same man who made them 25 years ago
1262602 so you think whoever stole them 25 years ago is the same person who is making them today
1262603 but why would he wait 25 years to put out the new version of the game
1262604 and why would they want to steal the games its not for the money because they give some of them out for free
1262605 and its not for the power because all the power went to you
1262606 yeah but maybe it wasnt supposed to go to me
1262607 or maybe it wasnt supposed to go to anyone at all
1262608 when the bomb went off was the man in the house
1262609 no thankfully he wasnt he was out buying groceries at the time he would have been killed
1262610 maybe the man who stole the games was trying to kill him
1262611 that is why the man left the country that and he had no reason to stay
1262612 no im afraid not he spent all his time inventing the games just to have it stolen away from him
1262613 he was rumored to have an affair but no one new who the girl was or even if it was true
1262614 is the house he used to live at still there
1262615 yes but its just a bunch of burned wood now it has some of his old furniture but he took the most valuable stuff with him when he left people have wanted to go search the house but there is two problems one it has a 20 foot fence all around it and two it is said to be haunted
1262616 even if people could get over the gate they would be to scared to enter anyway
1262617 im afraid i dont dear but im sure you could find out
1262618 johnny will show you out and give you your money
1262619 i have been searching on the internet for anything about the man who invented the game or his old house but there is nothing its like it never happened
1262620 you dont think the man made the whole thing up do you
1262621 i dont know but if it really happened someone would have known and written about it
1262622 the library keeps all the old town newspapers they have ones from 25 years ago if it really happened it would have to be in the newspaper
1262623 we are looking for an old newspaper around twenty five years old
1262624 sorry i took so long no one has ever asked for old newspapers
1262625 i know i guess he really did make it all up
1262626 anyway look it has the address of the burnt house
1262627 come on we are going to this house haunted or not it is the key to finding the inventor of potentia
1262628 well i mean were not going in the house right
1262629 of course we are how else do you expect to solve this mystery
1262630 we are going to solve this mystery and we are going inside this house
1262631 the better question is how are we going to get there
1262632 no we cant she will want to know why and we will have to tell her and then she will go tell the mayor who i definitely dont want to know
1262633 well you trusted him when you voted for him as mayor
1262634 yeah well it was him or the guy who wanted to change the town name to flausynausynillahillapillafication
1262635 so you wanted to change our town name to green day
1262636 and tell him what that we are just two poor kids who cant pay him i dont think he will buy that
1262637 hey i like this shirt why cant we give him yours
1262638 no and your going to have to let that go cause im not taking off my shirt
1262639 dont tell him we have no money until after he drives us there
1262640 ok thats it if you cant pay me im driving you back to the library
1262641 ok thats it stop it both of you im driving you back to the library
1262642 thats it you bratty kids you are going to get it now
1262643 we should have said we were going to a halloween party after all the house looks like a good place for that kind of party
1262644 yeah but he believed that it was a museum party so obviously he is not that smart
1262645 what are what are what are you going to do to us
1262646 sir uh before you kill us you might want to move your cab
1262647 i can see this is an emotional time for you but i have to tell you something
1262648 who comes driving up this street at 98 miles per hour
1262649 who parks there car in the middle of the road
1262650 look i drove you to your library party so just leave
1262651 who has library parties what would the games be pin the tail on the book or musical chairs but instead of chairs you sit on giant books
1262652 instead of telling him we had no money and having him drive off and having to jump out of the cab and be chased up this long hill
1262653 we could have just told him you were queen of potentia you have so much power he would have to do what you say
1262654 you have all this power why dont you just blow the gate up
1262655 yeah but maybe with all that power you could get magic
1262656 why do you think no one ever cleaned up the burnt house
1262657 but then again theres a lot of things i dont know
1262658 we should thank the car driver he probably saved our life
1262659 which means whoever he is was driving to this house
1262660 man we have been up and down this hill a lot of times today
1262661 yeah i was just thinking the same thing imagine what it must have been like to live here
1262662 do you need me to take you home or somewhere else
1262663 i really dont think we could walk all the way back up there and it seemed like you were going up there anyway
1262664 why were you driving up here there has to be a reason and the only thing up here is this house or well what use to be a house
1262665 i guess i cant say no to queen of potentia
1262666 i a journalist and i wanted to investigate this property i figured it would be a great story and maybe even be a headliner in newspapers or magazines
1262667 you see i want to be a great writer but sadly all i do now is write the obituaries
1262668 the thing in the newspaper that lists everyone that has died this week
1262669 yeah kind of is but its good to know whos died
1262670 although it was sad the day i looked down and read my grandmas name
1262671 not much i was hoping to get on the property and learn something anything that i could write about but after the accident i decided i should try another day
1262672 i didnt really know but i figured maybe i could try to figure out the code
1262673 every gate has a code thats how the man got inside you just type the code and the gate opens
1262674 hey why do you kids want to go inside that place
1262675 now that i am queen i just wanted to see where the game was invented
1262676 do you think it still works after twenty five years
1262677 i wonder if anyone has been in here since the fire
1262678 yes i did intense research but i found out only a little about him
1262679 i have to deal with my car and stuff so i guess this is good bye
1262680 your not going to be cursed you going to be haunted
1262681 great we are locked inside a cursed burnt down mansion
1262682 i can see it now kids locked in an old haunted mansion it would definitely be a box office hit
1262683 i want to get out of here as fast as possible
1262684 this is creepy maybe we should just go give up
1262685 which is what that we spent all day looking through someone elses burnt crap
1262686 well if they do make a movie about this we could star in it
1262687 yeah but they would probably want to make the movie a romantic comedy and have us get together in the end
1262688 lets just go you have a headache im tired and our parents our probably worried sick
1262689 yes it means someone was on the property after the fire
1262690 but we have no way of knowing whos credit card it is
1262691 and any fingerprints would be gone by now especially since the card has been under dirt for who knows how many years at least twenty five
1262692 i hate seeing you sad i i miss your pretty smile
1262693 im sorry i was out with johnny and my cell phone ran out of battery
1262694 i fell thats what took so long to get home i had to limp
1262695 great i have some random persons dirty old card on my wall
1262696 if anyone asks im saying its billie joe armstrongs how would they know the difference
1262697 we will have to make up a lie for why we were there
1262698 yeah but before they could ask about it i left to come here
1262699 i dont think so but im sure she will find out
1262700 i dont want you to ever go there again understand
1262701 maybe he just doesnt like me and tries to find any reason to yell at me
1262702 or maybe he just doesnt like that it makes the town look bad you know cause youre a bad queen
1262703 of course im not kidding that would be a horrible joke give me a break my jokes are funnier than that
1262704 the only way your being logical is if your brain is the size of an ant
1262705 um how about because we already went wasted our time found nothing and got in trouble for it
1262706 ok so its not a flawless plan but i have a feeling things will be different this time
1262707 ya and if you were psychic i would say lets go but being that your not
1262708 ya well maybe i dont want to be a sidekick or an
1262709 no im not going to waste my time there are so many better things we could be doing
1262710 why do we always end up yelling at each other
1262711 what are you saying you dont want to be friends anymore
1262712 but you always make me feel bad like im stupid and not funny and too scared and
1262713 i guess im wrong about my feeling that we should be together
1262714 at least searching though all this might keep my mind off johnny
1262715 all the power in the world and im locked inside a mansion
1262716 you stopped the conversation we were having to have me look at a drain
1262717 oh my god this is huge this is the most important thing ever
1262718 for water to go down into it and into a sewer or something
1262719 but this one has a cover over it so obviously there is something down there that is really important
1262720 you have serious problems we cant go down there who knows whats down there
1262721 exactly thats why we are going down there to find out what it is
1262722 well what are you excepting to find down there the inventor of potentia
1262723 maybe or maybe its the person who blew up the house
1262724 oh because that makes sense im sure he blew up the house and twenty five years later he comes back to live in a drain under the house
1262725 look i dont know whats down there but whatever it is its really important and it has do with potentia because its right outside the gate of the mansion
1262726 ok maybe it is important but we cant go down there
1262727 a piece of wood great because that solves all problems
1262728 are you sure you want to do this he asked
1262729 i have a feeling this isnt used as a drain
1262730 well i doubt whoever is in there has to worry about people breaking in
1262731 i know who would want to live in a drain
1262732 ya i know someone lives in a drain and not a hobo either
1262733 well for one thing they have their own sign language
1262734 what there is no such thing as hobo sign language
1262735 as if living in a drain isnt enough he keeps a giant chicken head in his closet
1262736 no look there is a little blue door past the kitchen
1262737 what we cant he will be really mad we broke in his house and we have no idea who he is
1262738 i know ok we will leave the house and wait for him to come outside and once he does we will talk to him outside where we are not in his house and were we can run away if we have to
1262739 yeah but who knows how long it will take him to come outside he doesnt seem to sociable
1262740 its the best game in the world i love it
1262741 he plays it all the time hes a potentia zombie
1262742 no you have to leave this is my house and you are not welcome
1262743 please we just want to know and and maybe help you i mean you cant be happy here
1262744 no im not answering questions im fine i dont need anyone
1262745 well yeah but its not a big deal i mean im not even good at it
1262746 i know why did he change his mind after he found out you were queen
1262747 yeah the first thing i want to know is why the game picked her
1262748 why do you live in a drain i asked him
1262749 i loved the mansion i grew up in it when it burnt down i just couldnt imagine leaving but i also knew i wouldnt be safe so i just figured i would live underground it worked out ok
1262750 but why were you in danger if they already had the game and or power they wouldnt need you
1262751 yeah but i could try to find them or control the game and i had a lot of power too so they were afraid they didnt know that the game was already set to pick one person
1262752 do you have any idea who did it i asked
1262753 none i hired a private detective but they couldnt figure it out after a while it got to painful to think about i just want to hide youre the first people to ever find me
1262754 why do you have a chicken head in the closet
1262755 do you do a lot of work in the laboratory
1262756 not in that one i had one in the mansion too and i spent much of my life in that one
1262757 inventing the game this one is more jut for fun i guess i like being the mad scientist
1262758 but dont you ever get lonely johnny asked he nodded
1262759 the game was stolen from you twenty five years ago but it came out recently do you know why
1262760 i dont even know why they stole it only one person can get power from it
1262761 there was and is a reason behind it and we have to find out
1262762 no it is to dangerous for kids the man is evil who knows what he would do
1262763 in fact you should go your mother is probably getting worried
1262764 there is something about him i just cant explain it
1262765 ik weet van al die aanslagen en ik weet wie er achter zit sterker nog ik weet zelfs wie er over anderhalve week wordt doodgeschoten maar ik stap niet met die informatie naar de politie o nee want die doet er he le maal niets mee

1262775 op 8 november 2005 is er een braziliaanse vrouw vermoord in de torensteeg in amsterdam ik werkte toendertijd in het caf ertegenover in de ochtend zat ik op het bankje tegenover de woning en hoorde een angstaanjagend geschreeuw wat naar later bleek een vrouw in doodsangst vreselijk geluid wat ik tot de dag van vandaag nog kan horen als ik er aan terugdenk je staat er niet bij stil dat zoiets gebeurt in een woning waar je tegenover staat tien minuten later kwam een medebewoonster thuis die de voordeur opendeed en vreselijk begon te gillen omdat daar het slachtoffer lag ik rende naar haar toe en begreep dat er iets vreselijks was gebeurd 112 gebeld politie kwam en alles werd afgesloten later die ochtend is er een man uit het pand gehaald geboeid vraag weet jij meer over deze zaak en de oplossing daarvan zo ja is er een veroordeling geweest en wat was deze heb overal gezocht maar kon niets terugvinden
1262776 gerry ulrich heeft de werkgroep de eerste diskettes met kinderporno evenwel zelf overhandigd zegt vervloesem
1262777 het enige dat klopt aan het verhaal is dat die jongens dat geld hadden gestolen de zaak is pas twee jaar later opgepakt door de nederlandse politie en toen aangeleverd aan belgi het was een zaak van niks cor de boer heeft zelf nooit de moeite genomen aangifte te doen en hij heeft zich ook niet onder medische behandeling laten stellen na de zogenaamde mishandeling
1262778 ik denk dat politie en justitie hem hebben gedreigd met de wet bibob voor zijn huidige vergunning en dat ze het op een akkoordje hebben gegooid maar als er iemand is met criminele contacten dan is het cor de boer ik heb vergunningen voor minder ingetrokken zien worden

1262804 each valid mode of knowing consists of an injunction an apprehension and a confirmation the injunction is generally of the form if you want to know this do this this injunction exemplar or paradigm is as thomas kuhn pointed out an actual practice not a mere concept the injunction or exemplar brings forth a particular data domain a particular experience apprehension or evidence this apprehension data or evidence is then tested in the circle of those who have completed the first two strands bad data or bad evidence is rebuffed and this potential falsifiability is the third component of most genuine validity claims it is not restricted to empirical or sensory claims alone there is sensory experience mental experience and spiritual experience and any specific claim in each of those domains can potentially be falsified by further data in those domains
1262805 the meaning of a statement is the means of its enactment
1262806 an inquiry into how human beings design and implement action in relation to one another
1262807 it is my conjecture that the fundamental mechanism for social evolution in general is to be found in an automatic inability not to learn not learning but not learning is the phenomenon that calls for explanation
1262808 not learning but not learning is the phenomenon that calls for explanation
1262809 defensive interpersonal and group relationships low freedom of choice and reduced production of valid information there are negative consequences for learning because there is little public testing of ideas the hypotheses that people generate tend to become self sealing what learning does occur remains within the bounds of what is acceptable double loop learning does not tend to occur as a result error escalates and effectiveness in problem solving and in execution of action tends to decrease
1262810 most people hold espoused theories inconsistent with model i and when confronted with our predictions about the strategies they will use seek to demonstrate that our predictions are not valid but even when model i has been explained and people are trying to produce action that does not fit the model they are unable to do so this result holds whenever people are dealing with double loop issues which is to say whenever they are dealing with threatening issues at best they are able to produce strategies consistent with opposite model i the mirror image of model i
1262811 action takes on the features represented by model i and opposite model i especially in situations that agents perceive as potentially threatening or embarrassing it is in such situations that agents are most oriented to controlling others and to protecting themselves self protection frequently takes the form of attributing responsibility for error to others or to the situation rather than to oneself the very situations that most require double loop learning are the ones that most evoke model i and opposite model i action action that inhibits double loop learning
1262812 states that when individuals programmed with model i theory in use deal with difficult and threatening problems they create primary inhibiting loops in the form of conditions of undiscussability self fulfilling prophesies self sealing processes and escalating error and they remain unaware of their responsibility for these conditions primary inhibiting loops lead to secondary inhibiting loops such as win lose group dynamics conformity polarization between groups and organizational games of deception these secondary inhibiting loops reinforce primary inhibiting loops and together they lead people to despair of double loop learning in organizations
1262813 all organizational defensive routines are based on a logic that is powerful and that has profound impact on individuals and organizations the logic is to i craft messages that contain inconsistencies ii act as if the messages are not inconsistent iii make the ambiguity and inconsistency in the message undiscussable and iv make the undiscussability of the undiscussable also undiscussable
1262814 when the situation that the actor frames involves other people then the framing will include the agents beliefs about the intentions and beliefs of other people the consequences of action include the reactions of those others which themselves depend on how they frame the situation and on their beliefs about the intentions and beliefs of the original actor
1262815 the consequences of action depend on the theories in use of recipients as well as those of actors ones theory in use includes a vast store of information about what people are like and how they will respond in various situations
1262816 sharing control with those who have competence and who participate in designing or implementing the action
1262817 the consequences of model ii action strategies should include minimally defensive interpersonal and group relationships high freedom of choice and high risk taking
1262818 by communicative competence i understand the ability of a speaker oriented to mutual understanding to embed a well formed sentence in relations to reality that is
1262819 a competence development approach to the foundations of social action theory the basic task here is the rational reconstruction of universal species wide competences and the demonstration that each of them is acquired in an irreversible series of distinct and increasingly complex stages that can be hierarchically ordered in a developmental logic the dimensions in which he pursues this task correspond to the universal pragmatic classification of validity claims that is to the four basic dimensions in which communication can succeed or fail comprehensibility truth rightness and truthfulness each of these specifies not only an aspect of rationality but a region of reality language external nature society internal nature in relation to which the subject can become increasingly autonomous thus ontogenesis may be construed as an interdependent process of linguistic cognitive interactive and ego or self development
1262820 only at the level of a universal ethics of speech can need interpretations themselves that is what each individual thinks he should understand and represent as his true interests also become the object of practical discourse
1262821 a situation of absolutely uncoerced and unlimited discussion between completely free and equal human agents
1262822 a reconstruction of the general symmetry conditions that every competent speaker who believes he is engaging in a discourse must presuppose as adequately fulfilled the presupposition of something like an unrestricted communication community an idea that apel developed following peirce and mead can be demonstrated through systematic analysis of performative contradictions participants in discourse cannot avoid the presupposition that the structure of their communication owing to certain characteristics that require formal description rules out all external or internal coercion other than the force of the better argument and thereby also neutralizes all motives other than that of the cooperative search for truth
1262823 to identify and reconstruct the universal conditions of possible understanding in other contexts one also speaks of general presuppositions of communication but i prefer to speak of general presuppositions of communicative action because i take the type of action aimed at reaching understanding to be fundamental thus i start from the assumption that other forms of social action for example conflict competition strategic action in general are derivatives of action oriented toward reaching understanding furthermore as language is the specific medium of understanding at the sociocultural stage of evolution i want to go a step further and single out explicit speech actions from other forms of communicative action
1262824 language represents a medium that simultaneously serves three different although internally related functions expressions that are employed communicatively serve to express the intentions or experiences of a speaker to represent states of affairs or something the speaker encounters in the world and to establish relations with an addressee the three aspects of a speaker coming to an understanding with another person about something are reflected therein
1262825 claims truth for a stated propositional content or for the existential presuppositions of a mentioned propositional content he claims rightness or appropriateness for norms or values which in a given context justify an interpersonal relation that is to be performatively established finally he claims truthfulness for the intentions expressed
1262826 language can be conceived as the medium of interrelating three worlds for every successful communicative action there exists a threefold relation between the utterance and a the external world as the totality of existing states of affairs b our social world as the totality of all normatively regulated interpersonal relations that count as legitimate in a given society and c a particular inner world of the speaker as the totality of his intentional experiences we can examine every utterance to see whether it is true or untrue justified or unjustified truthful or untruthful because in speech no matter what the emphasis grammatical sentences are embedded in relations to reality in such a way that in an acceptable speech action segments of external nature society and internal nature always come into appearance together
1262827 language is the medium through which speakers and hearers realize certain fundamental demarcations the subject demarcates himself 1 from an environment that he objectifies in the third person attitude of an observer 2 from an environment that he conforms to or deviates from in the ego alter second person attitude of a participant 3 from his own subjectivity that he expresses or conceals in a first person attitude and finally 4 from the medium of language itself
1262828 special region precisely because language remains in a peculiar half transcendence in the performance of our communicative actions it presents itself to the speaker and the actor pre consciously as a segment of reality sui generis
1262829 examined over 200 developmental sequences recognized by various branches of human knowledge ranging from stellar physics to molecular biology anthropology to linguistics developmental psychology to ethical orientations cultural hermeneutics to contemplative endeavors taken from both eastern and western disciplines and including premodern modern and postmodern sources
1262830 noticed that these various developmental sequences all fell into one of four major classes the four quadrants and further that within those four quadrants there was substantial agreement as to the various stages or levels in each
1262831 fundamental to the paradigm of mutual understanding is the performative attitude of participants in interaction who coordinate their plans for action by coming to an understanding about something in the world when ego carries out a speech act and alter takes up a position with regard to it the two parties enter into an interpersonal relationship the latter is structured by the system of reciprocally interlocked perspectives among speakers hearers and nonparticipants who happen to be present at the time on the level of grammar this corresponds to the system of personal pronouns whoever has been trained in this system has learned how in the performative attitude to take up and to transform into one another the perspectives of the first second and third persons

1262837 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100m a year taken from motorists how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1262838 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1262839 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence
1262840 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1262841 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1262842 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1262843 the government is clear that the best safety camera is the one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding

1262887 i have learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much
1262888 i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period for me
1262889 i hope next season will not be so unlucky with injuries but at the moment i just do not want to think about that the negative stuff if you think positive you get positive
1262890 my target is to be as fit as possible after a month because the season is long we have to build it all up slowly with gym work cardio work and games it is really important for me to get a good start
1262891 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game
1262892 then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to predict but hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and slowly build it up
1262893 for every team it is really important to get that confidence if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum it is important to win to get the answers to the questions
1262894 i think any of the top four can win the title
1262895 i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either but i hope we can

1262911 small jackets present a 9 track disc full of the detroit rock guitar era that fits roughly in the same area as flaming sideburns the hellacopters and bad wizard small jackets like big fuzzy guitars pentatonic riffs and wahwah filled solos there are moments of that remind me of motorhead a bit although the majority of the album sticks to a groove laden ac dc the stooges rolling stones on fuzz approach play at high level is a very lively chocked full of energy garage rock blues album

1262916 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1262917 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1262918 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1262919 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1262920 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1262921 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd

1262927 i guess jerry yang didnt come out of the meeting as unscathed as it seemed
1262928 we were surprised at the very high vote counts that were pro jerry yang
1262929 certainly the final results seemed very different from the exit polls
1262930 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1262931 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1262932 capital research global investors asked broadridge financial to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on its behalf
1262933 after these phones started entering chennai early this year there was a growing demand for them and now it is phenomenal on an average we sell at least 25 30 phones a month and their features are a major attraction for buyers
1262934 these phones are available at a lesser rate than branded phones many youth prefer to buy them just to showcase their status symbol
1262935 earlier there was not much demand but today along with other chinese goods approximately one lakh phones are shipped here thrice a week
1262936 i bought this phone because all my friends have it i like the sound quality and the large screen display and those features made me buy it
1262937 these days phones have also become a status symbol and i am not interested in investing a huge amount for a top end branded phone
1262938 another benefit is that this new concept allows for an increase in the range of frequencies while reducing costs

1262943 we worked with her since she was 13 1 2 years old we found her when we reached out to vocal coaches on long island when they were looking for a young overweight singer for jack blacks school of rock
1262944 she didnt get it but we stuck with her for 3 1 2 years
1262945 he showed it to the director and the casting director and they e mailed us the next day
1262946 she was one of only four to get a major callback

1262950 jeg kan f min sak p forsida avisens salgsplakat for seg selv
1262951 your stomach doesnt churn when you come to the ballpark what are you going to do walk him pitch to him id be lying if i didnt tell you that its the truth youd have to think for the other managers it was the same he was that dominant i havent seen barry i havent read about him
1262952 he got a shot but the shot they needed to get it in the joint space
1262953 and they cant do that without a fluoroscope he had been looked at by the doctors they said youre really not going to make this worse it just hurts so he played sunday and he got the shot this morning
1262954 if a guy takes a move the wrong way or if he got hit by a pitch and he aggravated it i think the hope is it lasts for a while
1262955 i dont know to be honest with you what the life of one of these is
1262956 but what i dont want to do is negate something like this that is for the benefit of the rest of the year and then have him run himself right back into the ground by the fifth inning
1262957 if he needs another day ive got no problem doing that
1262958 i thought he took a swing late in the game he was right on it he fouled it back
1262959 i know when he gets locked in were certainly a different team
1262960 ive got the leadoff helmet i carry with me every once in a while in case i need it
1262961 i dont think too much about lineups positions spots and stuff i know tito gets strapped a little bit and sometimes he needs somebody to fill in certain roles and i dont mind doing it at all
1262962 its something thats nice its something to be celebrated or whatever but i dont need that award to realize how far this year has come how good ive progressed how much more comfortable ive become on the mound
1262963 the great players that play this game they make their breaks thats the little challenge for me to make a break it feels like when i do make a pitch its right out of reach of somebody
1262964 the only time youve got to prove something to somebody is when youre in the minor leagues trying to make it up there
1262965 probably should have maybe squeaked that one out of there
1262966 i hit an 0 and 2 curveball i really thought i got it in the corner i dont know if he had it shaded over there i thought i got it in the corner but he was there
1262967 were close friends off the field so im sure ill be hearing about that when we get together tonight
1262968 hes always got the best of me tonight i got him
1262969 he was pitching with such confidence his body language he was working quicker he was coming off the mound with some aggression
1262970 but we got into that bind in that one inning there were a lot of baserunners and he was trying to be perfect just need to limit the damage hes growing
1262971 we talked about when he came back that its still a work in progress and we acknowledged that but i do like the way he went back out and handled himself and stayed out and pitched because thats the kid we think can really compete in this league
1262972 need to make a pitch get a ground ball and just the ground ball tonight was hit 150 miles an hour at jed
1262973 cant fault anybody for that it feels like its an inch away
1262974 the thing i hate is having a runner on third with less than two outs and not bringing him in
1262975 its an easy rbi but i put together some other good at bats
1262976 guys are beginning to pick it up after the break
1262977 we know theyre not going to hand us the division
1262978 all in all it was kind of ugly in the first inning im human i cant go out there and put up zeros inning after inning
1262979 weve said a lot this year that weve got to pitch better
1262980 once that starts happening there are some really good things on the horizon we know we can score we just let people score too many against us
1262981 his stuff was pretty good but maybe it wasnt the command we were used to seeing
1262982 i was trying to find a way to get on base
1262983 they were playing me way back at third base and that gave me the opportunity to get on
1262984 we were fortunate to get as many runs as we did off dan tonight
1262985 it doesnt happen often so when it does you hope you can shut the other team down
1262986 he was all over he was flirting with a lot of trouble every inning and just couldnt get anything going
1262987 things are progressing a lot of the soreness is going away but im just going to play it by ear
1262988 who knows how long this has been going on they say its just recently but who knows it might have gone on a long time and people have gotten away with it its taking advantage of very young poor kids who have nothing i cant think of anything worse that stealing from them
1262989 manny was a cleanup hitter so you dont get that everywhere
1262990 were going to play and were going to see whats happening hopefully well able to get around it and well continue to make adjustments
1262991 thats what we have to do now there were a lot of things going on and manny wanted to go so now everybody is playing the game hard the way its supposed to be and im not saying that because manny is gone i think were just going ahead and playing the game
1262992 we just have to make some adjustments ive been walking like crazy the last three games i havent had too many pitches to hit
1262993 what youll see is a veteran having a poor season who has a couple or three years left on his contract at big money those guys will get through waivers and then you have to determine if you want to burden yourself with the contract
1262994 i hope someday this can be used just like a scooter
1262995 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1262996 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1262997 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1262998 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1262999 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early

1263010 sensing something foul our men chased them and finally intercepted them near the police station
1263011 there were five persons in the car and they failed to produce any document for the vehicle
1263012 when we started interrogating them they admitted that they had hired the car from mirik on july 29 after coming down to the plains they had made the driver drink fruit juice laced with sedatives they had dropped him on the outskirts of jalpaiguri after he fell unconscious
1263013 during interrogation they also admitted that they had murdered a driver and had dropped the body in the teesta canal where it was found later
1263014 some of the victims were later identified as goldsmiths from the region working in north india they had been on their way home by train with their earnings when they were killed

1263016 i have the letter signed by two branch committee leaders of the morcha that says it is better for cpm and gnlf leaders to resign from their posts to maintain peace in the hills
1263017 the letter also says the morcha will not take responsibility if anything untoward happens to the leaders in case they do not resign this is undemocratic on the part of the morcha
1263018 what i had said was that gurung is well aware of these letters issued to intimidate our leaders and workers in the hills it is difficult to believe that the morchas central committee does not have information of the activities of the branch committees
1263019 some of the village committees have issued circulars and letters to leaders and supporters of anti morcha parties asking them to resign or leave the morcha central committee had no role in this
1263020 our party president bimal gurung had promised to extend help to chattrey subba this is why the party has decided to send advocates taranga pandit and dinesh chandra rai to jalpaiguri
1263021 the hearing restarted today and will continue till wednesday we will try and re assess the situation and then explore other legal options including moving the high court or the supreme court that might be available to subba for an early completion of the trial

1263073 um a question that a lot of people ask me um two questions a lot of people ask me when im when im speaking in public one is but do you like pornography
1263074 so as time went by i began to realise that there was this thing called research on sex crime and i began to study it and um so that when when well the most implicated thing in sex crime is sexual repression
1263075 um and then they would do this research in which they would represent their findings as having feminist sort or overtones so that people would hear it and say oh um pornography causes callousness toward women which sort of sounded good on the surface but then when you actually looked at it what they meant by callousness toward women was actually a feminist a womens liberation sort of approach to sexuality in which women could actually choose their own agency sexually um and they would you know people didnt mind homosexuals so much and people didnt perceive baby making as the only real function of women
1263076 but when i actually got involved in cos i was a feminist since like 1969 when um i actually got involved with the anti censorship movement that was reacting against the ah dworkin mackinnon legislation um against pornography um
1263077 and when i say i personally dont the next question people always ask me is well if you dont like pornography why do you care why do you wanna stop you know stop censorship
1263078 because another thing i know a lot about is being in a minority
1263079 but um you know being in a minority can hit you in so many large and small ways over things other people dont understand
1263080 and yet ive actually heard people like catharine mackinnon feminists women who i used to admire a great deal say things like this that you know if if um men enjoy pornography then they dont enjoy sexual enjoyment they dont deserve sexual enjoyment you know
1263081 um i think yes a lot of us do have really kinky weird fantasies that are very difficult to explain to other people
1263082 so before we start projecting our fears onto the material that other people are looking at we really have to ask ourselves is that really what theyre looking at or is it just our fears that were projecting and i think to a large extent it is our fears and the way that when the movie snuff was released
1263083 i have to reject any definition of porn that is the kind of sort of
1263084 um if youre gonna go round campaigning against sexist material then say so but if youre campaigning against porn what youre gonna ban is sexual material and when at that will usually get rid of lesbian material feminist material all kinds of material that isnt the sexist material and if you dont believe that you should look at what feminist activity to get rid of pornography in this country as well as the united states and canada has resulted in its actually hurt more feminist material than it has sexist material
1263085 um i remember being involved in a campaign in the united states in the early seventies where the obscenity laws on the grounds that is was so offensive to women um were used to um attack lesbian pornography that wasnt erotic pornography it was political
1263086 and if were gonna talk about sexist material then we have to be very very careful that we dont use the word pornography because as far as theyre concerned pornography means sexual material that disgusts them
1263087 um the other thing i thought was particularly interesting was the suggestion the idea that women are supposed to police sexuality police male sexuality stop men from raping um that its up to us to prevent men from raping us comes from pornography
1263088 id like to go back to what i started to say that before
1263089 now there may not be a relationship between those two things but there is certainly no sense in saying women are more oppressed because of pornography
1263090 um and i dont like the distinction between pornography and erotica
1263091 if you look at a lot of the pornography thats around especially amateur pornography
1263092 how do you feel about like just newspapers cos you havent really talked about what they theyve talked about err sort of mainstream but you havent talked much about like newspapers like the sport the star things like that carol interrupts
1263093 well i don find mainstream media much more sexist than i do actual pornography
1263094 the stuff thats in the newspapers is to me kinda frightening
1263095 err youre talking about sexual repression and i was just wondering whether you thought pornography was a positive thing to stop repression like i wasnt sure i just wanted to like um in the beginning of your speech carol interrupts
1263096 you say youre feminists against censorship so how do you suggest that we deal with child pornography and pornography that includes women being raped strangled beaten and murdered
1263097 no but what is happening now is women are being raped beaten and murdered in pornography how do you suggest we deal with now
1263098 no in pornography child pornography is you know children are being abused through the production of
1263099 so you suggest that should we outlaw the child pornography
1263100 we link to the melonfarmers because theyre a good source of what the law is and what is currently going on
1263101 he doesnt promote child pornography but he promotes no censorship including child pornography
1263102 sorry i really worry about the way people do that you know you know maybe what if you know it is your turn on to dress up as a little girl even though you may you know have a 38dd like some people we could name
1263103 if people see children as erotic thats the problem chair tells anti porn speaker to stop
1263104 well i dont know the people who seem to have the most pedophilia are people whove seen the least porn so no i dont really think its caused by porn
1263105 youre looking at the wrong part of up peoples environment you know
1263106 well if you have any better ideas get on and do something
1263107 well i looked at what other people were doing and said that wasnt very good and you didnt do that very well
1263108 it is when you start thinking about meanings resist and try effecting some change that your thoughts and deeds become public property and are up for scrutiny
1263109 lara you have been a card carrying feminist for almost 8 years now whats wrong with you cant you see youre being a chauvinist asshole
1263110 overall lower extremity mobility given the different movement planes forward back sideways and rotational
1263111 scapular stability on the side you are flying it also builds core strength and balance to stabilize the kite in strong wind
1263112 constant upward gaze might aggravate neck problems for some people
1263113 stand with your back to the wind and hold your kite up as high as you can make sure the nose is pointing straight up and then gently let it go if the breeze is strong enough the kite will start to rise slowly let out a little flying line and the kite will fly back then before it reaches the ground tighten your grip on the line and the kite will start to rise again repeat this until the kite gets up into steady winds

1263129 it is a matter of making the right choices in their training
1263130 he said once you get into this level of fitness you never have to lose it you can run a marathon every year of your life
1263131 it is much more necessary for him to give than for us to receive but we must not try for that i e to receive because the less we try or wish for it the more god gives
1263132 blessed he who has understood truly that god himself inside us as in instruments acts all deeds and all divine thinking theoria without us contributing anything whatever except for the disposition to the goods
1263133 happen to us through that madness which is granted to us by a divine giving
1263134 god stays away not because he has abandoned us but in order to free us from anything else and then bring us even closer to himself
1263135 all this war happens for humility the enemies i e demons fell because of their pride and they push also us to the loss through the same way some people have grown old in ascesis monastic life and yet they have not learned humility and they can not understand why they lack peace and their soul is sad
1263136 when someone is in trouble and is sad among tempests of passions he needs not to put himself to despair because this way sin gets even thicker and enters even deeper while when one has always the hope of god somehow evil gets thinner and leaves like water
1263137 then he rests blissfully modest because that which he desired the heavenly embraces him by itself easily
1263138 out of curiosity a friend of mine prompted this question what are the respective sexes of the two characters in the drawing
1263139 lara both characters are female it didnt occur to me at first that they could be anything other than female it is women i care about i want an end to women being forced into subordinate roles and forced to believe that its what they deserve that those roles are innate
1263140 im not overly concerned about men wearing feminine clothing and make up although i do take offence at their playing dress up with the tools of womens oppression
1263141 the only acceptable way for women to exist is in relation to men by submitting to men seeing their reality ours and denying our own
1263142 when white cells in the body get angry because of disease they produce chemical substances which kill bacteria but also turn on the glow of pholasin
1263143 we can tell if people are training too hard because their white cells get hectic we can also see the beginnings of infection so a physician can prescribe drugs early on
1263144 when you think of the immense amount of money it costs to take a team to china its important they are at their peak at the right time
1263145 we can detect changes in the body before they get symptoms white cells know you are ill before you do our test gets white cells to divulge their secrets
1263146 although the precise mechanisms are currently under investigation the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to the interaction of behavioural and biological changes as a result of sleep deprivation
1263147 given the fact that the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents continues to increase and chronic sleep insufficiency becomes more prevalent in modern society family and school based sleep interventions that aim to enhance sleep hygiene and increase sleep duration may have important public health implications for the prevention and intervention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children
1263148 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1263149 the signing of the southern african development community sadc free trade area is set for august 17 and member states want to walk into the signing occasion with all the fanfare and ceremony

1263157 ive tried to drop hints where are you getting those weapons are you a ninja have you ever heard of the way of the ancient order but she just draws that hoodie of hers even closer around her and acts as though she doesnt know what im talking about

1263175 statistics start to look less and less optimistic at that age
1263176 our salaries are competitive to the point we can still hire individuals who want to be durham police officers to say that they get paid enough i dont ever think we can get to that number
1263177 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad
1263178 a recent nonpartisan report ranks u s senators in terms of effectiveness where does elizabeth dole rank 93rd senator dole was ranked 93rd in effectiveness only six other senators ranked less effective she cant fix gas prices from 93rd place or create jobs and she sure hasnt fixed immigration from 93rd place elizabeth dole after 40 years in washington not as effective as you might think the democratic senatorial campaign committee is responsible for the content of this advertising
1263179 almost every senator comes to the senate with a pretty impressive resume
1263180 senator dole is a proven effective leader for north carolina while mrs hagan only offers nothing but negative false attacks
1263181 theyre not telling the truth about whether or not you can keep the teeth
1263182 thats a pretty substantial global company thats said were the best place for them to locate
1263183 theyre now becoming quite dependent on the u s marketplace
1263184 these new players are an extension of a well established trend and an important aspect of our economy
1263185 i didnt realize it had happened until he fell over
1263186 this is a way of trying to promote peace throughout the world

1263190 it cant affect me nearly as much as people who have children and families to support
1263191 if im struggling they must be struggling 100 times worse
1263192 you begin to see spots of corrosion in these ozzie and harriet neighborhoods
1263193 sometimes we wait two or three minutes there so we turn the ignition off and then start it up again when the light changes
1263194 as a rule turn off your engine if you expect to sit for more than about 30 seconds
1263195 especially in this age of high price gasoline we really cant afford to waste untold gallons at intersections where theres little or no cross traffic
1263196 the idling cars pollute the air so much and so unnecessarily
1263197 many of us hate the block by block stop and crawl i avoid the merchants there i dont go through there very much
1263198 with gas prices where they are were all a lot more conscious of this
1263199 we want to try to move it as safely and efficiently as we can
1263200 o ver and over i keep going over the world we knew

1263202 nos pareci un buen plan para que el mayor se integrara de una vez su hermana peque a ya hab a cumplido los tres a os y a n no hab amos pasado una temporada todos juntos s lo hac a visitas cortas
1263203 la nueva pareja intenta vivir el patr n de las vacaciones de la familia feliz y comete el error de juntarlos a todos por las buenas se dan de bruces contra la realidad porque terminan siendo las peores vacaciones de su vida
1263204 los padres creen que se van a dar una buena oportunidad y que es una ocasi n fant stica para conocerse todos y crear v nculos pero lo hijos puede que vayan en otra direcci n
1263205 podr a haber optado por que cada uno estuviera con sus ni os y luego irnos solos pero es una relaci n de tiempo y creo que es importante implicarte afectivamente con los hijos de tu pareja
1263206 los padres deber an dedicar dos o tres d as a sus hijos biol gicos a un ni o le molesta mucho que su padre lo trate igual que a los hijos de su pareja ellos necesitan saber que siguen siendo exclusivos
1263207 es muy raro juntar a todos se renuncia al intento y no por falta de conexi n sino por temor a que la madre o el padre biol gico de los ni os se entere de que van a estar con la otra o el otro y saboteen las vacaciones es un riego que casi nadie asume
1263208 acuden al juzgado pero el periodo de vacaciones se agota antes de que terminen los tr mites
1263209 muchos padres utilizan a los ni os como arma de presi n si no han recibido por ejemplo la parte de los gastos extraordinarios que ellos piden entonces si el convenio no refleja hora de entrega los llevan a las doce de la noche o justo despu s de que haya salido el avi n rumbo al destino vacacional
1263210 mi hija tiene que respetar mi elecci n y no puede organizarme la vida
1263211 el progenitor del segundo no lo consinti amenaz con quitarle a mi pareja la custodia y con el desgaste todo se derrumb
1263212 de c mo se afronten las primeras vacaciones depender el modo que ense emos la parte de socializaci n la parentalidad
1263213 i called him by his name and said what are you doing
1263214 its just totally out of character what little i knew of him he was very quiet and reserved
1263215 i asked two of the kids what happened and they said man the gangs all of em up in there
1263216 people are sending me e mails that we have to be more accountable
1263217 the best explanation this may sound strange since i have chosen the political arena as my career but im more comfortable in the presence of 20 people than i am in the presence of 200 people
1263218 that convention is wall to wall people i could see losing four or five days when i could be at home my record will remain intact
1263219 la base genetica che fa sentire le donne appartenenti allaltro sesso
1263220 colpa della variante genetica che fa aumentare la concentrazione degli ormoni sessuali compreso il testosterone e degli effetti che questi squilibri hanno sul cervello anche nelle primissime fasi di vita
1263221 i told the f ing idiot he wouldnt get out of this one
1263222 as a man rejoices over his new wife so the lord rejoiced over you
1263223 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1263224 ive had more sleepless nights i guess its come back to haunt me for ever bragging about not being stressed out
1263225 i kind of put my pride aside before something really bad happens
1263226 i have a meeting with my doc on thursday and hopefully ill be up that way on friday
1263227 the consequences are what they are im willing to accept them
1263228 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important it is a ton of money but at this time i dont feel like i can put a price tag on my mental state
1263229 as a guy who went through that early in my career taking the medication i certainly understand
1263230 prayer and having people around me that i knew cared about me
1263231 stop some of the bleeding start some of the healing process maybe a little bit
1263232 i just want to look em in the eye and let em all know this wasnt bs this was for the mental health of me i could have gone out there and gotten any one of you hurt
1263233 i like how spongebob handles life he gets picked on all the time but hes still happy he doesnt get angry with people he just goes through life with a smile on his face
1263234 i know there are harsh people in this world but dang that made me feel low i do care what people think about me to an extent
1263235 has kind of turned into this monster right now i know everybodys not forgiving i feel like my teammates will be but everybodys entitled to their own opinion
1263236 if i made comments every time i heard a rumor ill be talking to you every day and have to answer every question you the media ask
1263237 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1263238 this strong performance reflects the companys success in redeeming loans in the first half of the year
1263239 these actions to be taken to improve the regulatory capital position of the company will not change the governments net cash exposure to northern rock
1263240 we continue to envisage that the government loan facilities will be repaid before the end of 2010
1263241 the level of new lending is expected to increase modestly in the second half of the year while remaining significantly below the companys historic levels
1263242 in line with the companys policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower will not maintain payments
1263243 this has been a challenging process and inevitably one which is highly unsettling for the organisation nevertheless the company remains on track to conclude this process and achieve the necessary reductions in line with the plan
1263244 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is about going for it
1263245 thats our approach its pedal to the metal thats what every move is based on or what every attempted move is based on with an eye toward the present and an eye toward the future but were going for it
1263246 it gives the team stability its a collision sport you dont know how long the careers are its a difficult sport to work in for players i appreciate that a lot of players hit unrestricted free agency they may have had a mediocre season the year before they might have had an injury but its tough out there the security of being a multimillionaire i think is appealing still to both the team and the players then youll have to adjust if there are significant changes ups or downs
1263247 you just need two reasonable sides and usually these things do have a way of working themselves out weve never not worked something out with brian and hopefully this will play itself out well
1263248 i think you forget sometimes how successful hes been and weve been
1263249 show us and the league that hes back to the old lito feels healthy that hes got great playmaking ability and certainly a lower ypa yards per pass attempt against him and just really perform the way that we know lito can i think thats what hes going to do
1263250 jag vill hemskt g rna ha barn och om du inte vill det s kan vi inte forts tta tr ffas
1263251 jag undrade varf r jag inte klarade det h r sj lvklara
1263252 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part
1263253 i understand but come on man look at my nose
1263254 yo i said im sorry man can we squash this
1263255 ok fine its cool listen can you hand me that ice pack over there
1263256 naw man i gotta get back to practice get well bro
1263257 injuries are such a key element today because with the contracts payrolls and overall lack of talent nobody has that much depth
1263258 probably most teams can piece it together if they lose one or two integral guys but if you get beyond that its tough
1263259 i think its just being very lucky i think things have to fall right for you
1263260 i think we were really unlucky last year to some extent
1263261 but we also made some changes that we think have helped weve tried to be proactive
1263262 if youre talking about something like what happened to jimmy rollins youre talking about luck his ankle caught when he was in a bad position thats an injury that cant be controlled
1263263 then there are some you might be able to predict maybe you have some guys in spring training and their shoulder is a little tighter than youd like thats kind of a crapshoot
1263264 i was excited relieved i could start getting back on the court
1263265 this is a process where you cant really be on the court without a contract youve just got to wait it out i was excited to be able to stay here and at the same time get back to work
1263266 he was so anxious he didnt have what you could call a big outburst
1263267 it was more like an exhale it was a great process for him
1263268 we talk about upside with players and lous is as high as he wants to go
1263269 what i think is great is hes a hard worker hell give it all he has but this kid has a big upside will he get there thats what were banking on as were giving him this contract and i dont have a big hang up that he has to be a stone cold 1 or 2 i just think hes a good basketball player
1263270 i dont think i or any player sets out to be a sixth man or a seventh man
1263271 you always want to be a big part of a team the position im in now coming off the bench giving us a spark i love that role but you always want to grow as a player
1263272 ive always been one of those type of guys where i always felt i was going to be an nba player and i always felt like i was going to put myself in a position to make a lot of money over my career
1263273 things dont just happen overnight were just in the middle of negotiations
1263274 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1263275 i dont know if im going to get a chance to lead the football team but youre going to have to pry the ball out of my fingers this year
1263276 it felt good real real good to be out there with the guys to test the waters out so to speak just to get back out there and sweat with the guys
1263277 he looks like the old dawk hes always taking care of his body in the hot tub getting massages and stretching hes doing all the little extra things that you think you can get away without doing when youre younger
1263278 you get an injury when you are a rookie and its because you have fatigued legs you get an injury when youre 35 the same exact injury and its because youre old same injury i had now is the same one i had about 6 years ago hyperextended knee its the same injury but because im 35 now its because im getting older
1263279 dawk is the kind of guy you can never count out
1263280 hes the guy who never says quit he looks real good to me the same now as he does during the season i feel more comfortable with him on the field than i do with anybody else
1263281 look im gonna go out and whatever i can give im gonna give
1263282 i anticipate being me i only know one way to play and thats full speed and thats how ill do it ive always done it that way and im gonna go out and give all i can to those guys on game day thats how im gonna do it
1263283 youre talking about the cornerstone of the defense and of this team
1263284 i dont want to think about when hes not here i look at him as a father figure as a guy i look up to i dont want to think about that right now if that comes well have to deal with it then but i dont want to think about that

1263288 i can totally see now that women are forced apart from each other and forced into relationships with men
1263289 you know what i just thought is that i do trust you and that is a heart warming realisation
1263290 i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes
1263291 girls are so queer you never know what they mean they say no when they mean yes and drive a man out of his wits for the fun of it
1263292 everything in the world began with a yes one molecule said yes to another molecule and life was born but before prehistory there was the prehistory of prehistory and there was the never and there was the yes

1263297 these quad machines are very noisy and cause the same noise pollution as motorbikes
1263298 in this instance though weve had many complaints from residents of the villages of mesoyi tala tremithusa emba kissonerga and chlorakas
1263299 we have a campaign to try to eliminate this problem
1263300 at least once a week police are in these areas trying to prevent illegal machines from driving on the road and to stop any offenders lawbreakers are charged and sent to court
1263301 since january we have had around ten such cases and the culprits paid fines ranging from 500 1 000 for various charges
1263302 obviously it would be better if these machines were only permitted for use off road but if they are properly registered the law allows them to be driven on the roads
1263303 we are always grateful for information received from the general public which helps us tackle this and other traffic offences
1263304 but these quad bikes are making life here a misery teenagers ride them and they seem to make continual rounds of the villages in the area
1263305 i think cyprus should ban these bikes from the roads and permit their use only for off road driving which im sure they are more suitable for
1263306 i moved to a village because i wanted some peace after living in the centre of paphos for years it seems as if no corner of paphos is quiet any more i know my neighbours feel as i do
1263307 i would like to know why the parents of these youngsters are allowing them to behave in this way
1263308 if it was my son or daughter i would teach them to respect other people its a sign of the times
1263309 there is still i think not enough recognition by teachers of the fact that the desire to think which is fundamentally a moral problem must be induced before the power is developed most people whether men or women wish above all else to be comfortable and thought is a pre eminently uncomfortable process it brings to the individual far more suffering than happiness in a semi civilised world which still goes to war still encourages the production of unwanted c3 children by exhausted mothers and still compels married partners who hate one another to live together in the name of morality
1263310 it was a little tight in the fourth and i came back out in the fifth and its not necessarily even in my shoulder its kinda in my deltoid below my shoulder so my strength was find and my velocity was fine i just kind of got a stiff arm
1263311 it was in the fifth it was a little bit tight early and in the fifth i think i threw either a 2 0 or 2 1 pitch to marlon byrd and it got me a little bit i threw the next one and it was okay and then the two after that kind of got me a little bit
1263312 we saw him shake his arm so we ran out there
1263313 i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there if you see a large drop off in velocity then theres a huge concern but when i saw him shake his arm i said lets go check him and we ran out there
1263314 hes got a little stiffness right here touches left deltoid muscle we believe its muscular hell have some tests tomorrow but we dont believe its anything serious im not really concerned that hes going to be shut down for a while but theres a chance hes going to have to miss a start
1263315 it doesnt hurt in the wrong places to really hopefully be concerned so im just gonna go and get everything taken care of just so they can rule out everything and make sure everythings alright this is just getting stiff a lot in a short amount of time its a little stiff but other than thats why we go back and just rule everything out
1263316 so hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is
1263317 it was something where it grabbed and popped and got stiff
1263318 we have initialed the text of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain last july 27 2008 the pact is a done deal it is binding on the contracting parties who are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of their agreement
1263319 the act of initialing the moa ad agreed text between the parties
1263320 done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1263321 nothing this is not even a setback to the milf we are on the upper hand especially in the battle for moral ascendancy
1263322 it is the arroyo administration which is shamed in the eyes of the international community there are so many ambassadors already in the malaysian capital to attend the signing ceremony only to be told that it is cancelled at the last minute
1263323 i do not have to give the reasons behind my decision
1263324 the law has to be applied to all equally but some always find a window of escape
1263325 the sure thing is that president christofias does not give out the message of the just and fair society that he was promising before the presidential elections
1263326 without knowing all the details i am against granting any form of clemency because no one is above the law
1263327 as a matter of principle all people are equal before the law
1263328 if it is judged that someone should be granted clemency the reasons behind this form of pardon should be known so it does not upset the citizens because they have a right to know
1263329 i am sure that if the president granted his pardon it is for important reasons
1263330 i will not judge president christofias decision for pardoning the young lawyer but i would like to point out that some people in society such as lawyers mps and doctors have to be an example of upholding the law and of proper social behaviour
1263331 i do not personally know the circumstances under which the pardon was granted or the reasons as to why it was suggested but if it was granted under no significant grounds it is unjustifiable and no one can be above the law everyone should be equal before the law and since no explanations were given each citizen has the right to believe that because of her profession as lawyer that makes her more equal to the law
1263332 if you cant do the time dont do the crime
1263333 he says there were no serious injuries suffered during the rage against the machine performance though some people were taken to the hospital for broken bones and most would be released by monday
1263334 there will always be up years and down years in the market but the diversification of the common retirement fund helped us weather the economic downturn

1263762 the purpose of this study was to try to identify at least in our practice if a patient in a certain age group should repeat a cycle and how many we found that the overwhelming majority of women who became pregnant 96 achieved pregnancy by their second attempt although the probability of a pregnancy after the third and fourth attempts remains encouraging these results confirm that there is negative correlation between achieving pregnancy and increasing the number of attempts nonetheless for all patients undergoing art treatment failure of the first attempt justifies at least one additional cycle
1263763 the overall pregnancy rate regardless of the mothers age was 39 2 3 515 pregnancies out of 8 970 cycles the highest number of art attempts was eight but only a handful of patients had six or more attempts
1263764 we observed a more consistent pregnancy rate in the older age groups starting at 36 years
1263765 for the group aged 36 39 the pregnancy rate was 25 at the fourth attempt however it only includes four pregnancies out of 16
1263766 an art cycle is financially burdensome but most importantly an emotional endeavour it also requires exposure to medications and to although minor a surgical procedure from our findings it appears that younger patients undergoing two art attempts benefit from the highest chances of pregnancy while women in the higher age groups aged 36 and older may benefit from a successful outcome when undergoing a third or perhaps fourth attempt

1263862 teaching is a noble profession we are analysing feedback received from teachers and their organisations in this regard what i can tell at this time is that we could propose certain measures to ensure that their problems are sorted out and more people take an interest in joining the profession

1263865 there are only six people on this committee it is obvious that we will take time to complete our study but our recommendations will be helpful to the teaching fraternity
1263866 the committee hopes that the states will be convinced to think more positively in their own interest for sparing adequate resources for higher education
1263867 pay revision is but an inescapable and most crucial step towards attracting and retaining the talented people to the teaching profession none of the states can afford to lag behind anymore
1263868 the recent trends show significant improvement in state finances at present the states have a revenue surplus of about 0 5 percent
1263869 angesichts der konjunkturellen schw chephase und der mageren impulse aus der drupa gehen wir davon aus dass es nicht gelingen wird das umsatzdefizit des ersten halbjahres von rund 10 millionen gegen ber unserer urspr nglichen planung im zweiten halbjahr auszugleichen
1263870 aus heutiger sicht erscheint es eher wahrscheinlich dass wir unser umsatzziel von 160 millionen f r das gesamtjahr um ungef hr 15 millionen verfehlen werden
1263871 um unter diesen umst nden das ergebnis zu stabilisieren und zu steigern haben wir eine reihe von ma nahmen eingeleitet die das operative ergebnis um 3 millionen pro jahr verbessern werden davon sollen etwa 2 millionen noch im aktuellen gesch ftsjahr wirken dazu geh rt dass wir spezielle komponenten der k ltetechnik verst rkt selbst produzieren die abl ufe der produktion deutlich effizienter gestalten und die kapazit ten dem niedrigeren umsatzniveau anpassen unser ziel ist es auf der basis der neuen umsatzprognose eine ebit marge von 7 bis 8 prozent f r das gesamtjahr zu erwirtschaften
1263872 wir rechnen zwar damit dass wir hier im zweiten halbjahr h here ums tze als im ersten halbjahr erzielen werden aber der erwartete drupa effekt wird sich voraussichtlich nicht signifikant auswirken
1263873 das interesse f r den bereich reinigungssysteme ebenso wie f r das thema energieeffizienz war ausgesprochen hoch und wir sind berzeugt dass wir hier strategisch die richtigen weichen gestellt haben f r die weitere mittel und langfristige entwicklung des unternehmens
1263874 wir rechnen auch hier f r den weiteren jahresverlauf mit einer positiven entwicklung einerseits werden die im markt installierten systeme infolge der investitionszur ckhaltung lter und es entsteht erh hter bedarf an wartung und ersatzteilen zus tzlich rechnen wir mit positiven beitr gen aus unseren neuen tochtergesellschaften und dar ber hinaus ist in diesem segment der bereich technische dokumentation enthalten global document solutions gds seit mehreren jahren w chst dieser bereich weit berdurchschnittlich und bietet mit seinen produkten und dienstleistungen ein gesch ft weitgehend unabh ngig von der druckindustrie wir sind deshalb bereit gds strategisch weiterzuentwickeln um einen bereits sehr erfolgreichen grundstein unseres dienstleistungsbereiches in deutlich andere gr enordnungen zu bringen
1263875 die zufriedenstellenden auftragseing nge von der drupa werden unsere operativen gesch ftsergebnisse im zweiten und dritten quartal gegen ber den ersten drei monaten verbessern
1263876 wir konnten unsere weltweit f hrende stellung in der branche auf der messe verdeutlichen nach wie vor ist das aktuelle marktumfeld aber von schwierigen rahmenbedingungen gekennzeichnet zum mittelfristigen ausgleich dieser effekte dient unser bereits eingeleitetes ma nahmenpaket zur verbesserung unserer kostenstruktur
1263877 aufgrund der schwachen umsatzentwicklung sowie der zus tzlichen kostenbelastungen haben wir im ersten quartal des gesch ftsjahres wie bereits angek ndigt ein negatives betriebsergebnis erzielt
1263878 das zur kostensenkung eingeleitete ma nahmenprogramm treiben wir mit allem nachdruck voran so dass die einspareffekte wie geplant realisiert werden k nnen
1263879 qiagen hat seinen wachstumskurs im zweiten quartal fortgesetzt zweites quartal 2008
1263880 das zweite quartal zeigte ein starkes umsatz und gewinnwachstum und wir konnten unsere strategische positionierung und unsere marktf hrerschaft weiter ausbauen wir haben 19 neue produkte im bereich probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sample amp assay technologies mit schwerpunkten in gen und proteinfunktionsanalyse in den markt eingef hrt im juni haben wir die ersten modelle unseres neuen flagschiffes die qiasymphony plattform ausgeliefert die im januar in den markt eingef hrt wurde und bereits enormes interesse bei unseren kunden aus allen bereichen hervorgerufen hat im juli konnten die noch wenigen verbliebenen projekte in zusammenhang mit der integration der digene dem management der entsprechenden abteilungen innerhalb der organisation bergeben werden damit ist die projektorganisation der digene integration entsprechend unseren zeitvorgaben und besser als erwartet hinsichtlich der realisierung von kostensynergien abgeschlossen
1263881 mit der akquisition der corbett life science im juli dieses jahres konnten wir unserer qiagen instrumentenplattform zwei weitere wichtige produkte hinzuf gen und unsere technologief hrerschaft im bereich der molekularen diagnostik weiter ausbauen beide produkte der rotor gene real time pcr cycler und das cas instrument f r die vorbereitung und das ansetzen molekularbiologischer tests k nnen mit qiagens probenvorbereitungs und testtechnologien sample amp assay technologies perfekt kombiniert werden zus tzlich l sst sich der rotor gene real time pcr cycler leicht in die qiasymphony plattform integrieren und vervollst ndigt so ein automationssystem das den gesamten arbeitsprozess von der probenvorbereitung bis zum ergebnis in allen bereichen von pcr basierenden analytischen tests abdeckt
1263882 wir sind sehr zufrieden mit dem finanzergebnis im zweiten quartal 2008 der umsatz lag innerhalb und der gewinn pro aktie lag ber unseren erwartungen f r dieses quartal das zweite quartal verzeichnete ebenfalls ein starkes wachstum in der bereinigten operativen marge auf 28 was einem operativen gewinnwachstum von 68 gegen ber dem vorjahresergebnis entspricht und die erzielten kostensynergien in zusammenhang mit der digene akquisition reflektiert

1263885 healthy incoming orders from drupa will mean better operating results in the second and third quarters than in the first three months
1263886 the trade show enabled us to underline our position as the world leader in the industry but difficult underlying conditions are still impacting on the current market situation the package of measures already introduced to improve our cost structure will compensate these effects in the medium term
1263887 as already indicated weak sales and additional costs led to a negative operating result for the first quarter of the financial year
1263888 we are working hard to ensure successful implementation of the package of cost cutting measures introduced so that the resultant savings can be achieved as planned
1263889 mit den aktualisierten leitlinien tragen wir den wissenschaftlichen erkenntnissen der letzten jahre rechnung zahlreiche studien zeigen dass die kombination eines pap tests mit dem hpv test deutlich mehr sicherheit bietet frauen mit einem erh hten risiko f r geb rmutterhalskrebs zu identifizieren als der pap test allein
1263890 geb rmutterhalskrebs tritt bei frauen ab 30 jahren am h ufigsten auf durch den einsatz beider tests in dieser altersgruppe hoffen wir die anzahl der frauen die an geb rmutterhalskrebs erkranken oder sogar sterben deutlich reduzieren zu k nnen
1263891 im gegensatz zu anderen krebsarten kann geb rmutterhalskrebs praktisch zu 100 prozent verhindert werden wenn frauen und ihre rzte zugang zum hpv test und weiteren fortschritten der pr ventionsdiagnostik haben
1263892 die neuen leitlinien der deutschen gesellschaft f r gyn kologie und geburtshilfe spielen eine wichtige rolle dabei rzten und durch sie auch ihren patientinnen dabei zu helfen die effektivsten methoden zu verstehen mit denen diese krankheit ausgerottet werden kann qiagen bef rwortet die neuen leitlinien der dggg f r deutschland einem land mit 80 millionen einwohnern in dem das unternehmen stark vertreten ist
1263893 nach der erfolgreichen finanzierung im ersten quartal haben wir uns im zweiten quartal ganz der entwicklung unserer produkte gewidmet und dabei ber das gesamte portfolio hinweg bedeutende fortschritte gemacht
1263894 ich m chte herrn dr berlin f r seinen herausragenden beitrag zur entwicklung von epigenomics in den letzten zehn jahren danken wir freuen uns dass wir auch in der zukunft auf sein wissen in der dna methylierung und der patentlandschaft in diesem bereich bauen k nnen

1263896 neben unseren erheblichen fortschritten im operativen bereich und in der produktentwicklung war die erste jahresh lfte von strikter finanzdisziplin verbunden mit einem umsatzwachstum gepr gt aus diesem grund liegen alle unsere finanzkennzahlen im rahmen unserer erwartungen

1263950 i have had contemplative thoughts about this word i find myself typing so frequently
1263951 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1263952 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1263953 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1263954 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1263955 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1263956 hes been the best ambassador our state has ever had
1263957 he could live anywhere in the world and he came back home
1263958 i just think it shows a lot about him as a person and how grounded he is

1263960 i want to commend the house republicans for once again standing up for the needs of the american people
1263961 i applaud the efforts of the republican congressmen for putting americans needs ahead of their own demanding action from the democrat congress and revolting against politics as usual in washington
1263962 the fed is really locked in right now they cant go forward or backward
1263963 we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1263964 i dont see the fed changing policy until next spring when i expect to see them start to raise rates
1263965 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1263966 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1263967 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1263968 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1263969 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1263970 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1263971 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1263972 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1263973 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1263974 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1263975 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1263976 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1263977 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1263978 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1263979 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1263980 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1263981 my buddy and i having a little fun in afghanistan in 2005
1263982 work will always expand to fill the time allowed for its completion
1263983 what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new
1263984 mi chiedete com brad pitt da quel punto di vista be diciamo che non un grande affare mi capite
1263985 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1263986 as important as we think football is at this time of the year it is minuscule in comparison to the health and faith of our student athletes our hearts and prayers go out to the pressey family not only now in their time of bereavement but also in the future
1263987 giving up baseball had to be probably the hardest decision ive ever made in my life
1263988 but i knew i was definitely going to have to be at full strength and be 100 percent with the football program to help the program get to where we want to be the acc championship and contending for a national championship
1263989 weve got some guys back there that have played in games and understand what it takes said first year defensive coordinator everett withers
1263990 now its just a matter of getting better in training camp this year and seeing if we can get better in games
1263991 i talked to my family i talked to my coaches but in the end i knew it needed to be my decision
1263992 and although it hurt my heart i knew it was time
1263993 this summer was probably the best summer ive had in my life as far as training
1263994 i knew i had to get faster to go against the best receivers in the acc and our nonconference opponents so being able to get the confidence that i can run with receivers like tar heels brandon tate brooks foster hakeem nicks that was key before i was lacking a little bit of being able to run with them now im confident that i can
1263995 he has a knack of just being around the football withers said
1263996 hes gotten a whole lot smarter hes got a whole lot more confidence nicks said
1263997 lets us know hes committed that were a team that we want the same thing that we have the same goal
1263998 i had a chance to go out there to omaha but it was just too hard burney said
1263999 i love the boys and everything but for me to go back out there would have broken me back down and i had to build myself up for football but i love them boys i love the coaches over there and i loved the time i had with them
1264000 if only every jury in this country reacted to racism or bigotry the way this jury did we would have a much better jury system
1264001 stubborn rude stingy are thieves and have stolen other persons ideas
1264002 we must ensure that american companies operating in repressive regimes protect fundamental human rights
1264003 transparency about speech restrictions and to carefully implemented protections for user data
1264004 were very strict were probably the strictest among the web sites we dont encourage racy bikini content on our web site
1264005 this year you can see the industry has shaped up and realize you have to be very strict and careful
1264006 there are obvious ones we simply do not let them go up
1264007 its simple if these things get shown then the site will get shut down we make sure there are no such things
1264008 many of the web 2 0 sites have their own self censorship polices and built in systems to comply with government regulations
1264009 but i think this compromise costs them it is a tricky method to help businesses find their way to survive in china
1264010 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent
1264011 it is at least possible though its not certain that itll affect their vote
1264012 to develop innovative products industry relies on the same experts
1264013 as part of our 401 k retirement assets we are receiving monthly income from a ginnie mae fund although there has been a great deal of press as to the vulnerability of freddie and fannie i have not seen a mention of ginnie perhaps some of your readers would appreciate a better understanding of the differences
1264014 the bank collects mortgage payments from borrowers and passes payments to ginnie mae which passes them through to investors
1264015 if the bank cant make all or part of the pass through payment ginnie mae makes sure that bondholders continue to get their promised payments
1264016 you dont have to worry about credit risk with ginnie maes
1264017 they are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government just like a treasury bond thats not the case with fannie and freddie although recent steps suggest that if they dont have the full faith and credit theyre pretty close
1264018 jeg vil ikke afvise at du kan finde mig i et konsortium sammen med andre der g r ind og byder p kmd
1264019 det ser specielt positivt ud i rusland de vokser mere end markedet
1264020 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1264021 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1264022 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1264023 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1264024 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1264025 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1264026 its not just energy there are a host of markets from fuels to electricity to storage to efficiency to water treatment
1264027 you could not see such things happen before in china because of the controlled media
1264028 you can see grassroots based technology helping people become empowered
1264029 if something happened in the world and there are 10 sources of information on this event even if i block nine you can get one thats enough for you you dont need the other nine resources once you get that information you can forward that to others
1264030 i dont think it will work to block or filter something
1264031 it was completely different from what i learned in school
1264032 its hard to believe the first time you see a different edition of history at first i felt its unbelievable then i felt angry because i was deceived for such a long time
1264033 it is not like i want to knock down the government or rise in rebellion against government officials
1264034 it is just a shame that there are many good tools and information that we cannot access and use
1264035 it changes the configuration of the social structure and fabric weve only seen the beginning
1264036 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with
1264037 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1264038 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1264039 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1264040 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1264041 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1264042 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1264043 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1264044 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1264045 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1264046 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1264047 we just touched the surface of the potential on the web
1264048 now we need to turn up the volume and to get more people involved explore what the future could look like and inspire us to do it
1264049 we are trying to make peoples interaction with the technology more natural and more physical
1264050 some of these things are right around the corner and some will take another 10 years to unfold
1264051 traditionally you would have to submit code but now you can just bring an idea even a sketch on a piece of paper
1264052 they are trying to show that they are taking the leadership of the designers and they are looking to innovate in the areas where there is still room for innovation
1264053 it has been a very static area there is not a lot more that you can do in terms of the functionality but there is always something that can be done about the look and feel of the browser and thats where the public is always happy to see changes

1264071 design is high bandwidth the net is low bandwidth volunteer software projects are usually highly distributed with contributors in different cities or even different continents so project communications are mostly plain text in e mail instant messaging irc or a bug tracking system but interaction design is multi dimensional involving the layout and behavior of elements over time and the organization of those elements in an overall interface when developers are in the same room they can discuss interaction design using whiteboards paper prototypes spoken words and gestures but on the internet these often arent available making discussions much slower and prone to misunderstandings solutions develop and promote voip video chat virtual whiteboard sketching and animation software that allows easier communication of design ideas over the internet and whenever possible hold physical meetings for developers to collaborate in person
1264072 often these teams dont communicate with each other frequently and unlike their proprietary competitors they nearly all have different release cycles this makes usability improvements difficult and slow to implement if those improvements involve coordinating changes across multiple parts of the system
1264073 the squad is made up of the players who have done so well for us over the past year and we have every confidence that they will regain the number one ranking on the reliance mobile odi standings from australia
1264074 the only player who is no longer part of the mix is charl langeveldt who is no longer available
1264075 we have included hashim amla as the 15th player in the squad because of the heavy workload that graeme smith has had to carry and the injuries he has suffered recently hashim played in our most recent odi series against bangladesh and he will provide the cover in the opening batting area
1264076 including the warm up matches there are nine matches to be played in the limited overs section of the tour and the selection of an additional player is more than justified

1264113 i think stephen is a bit disappointed but from our point of view he will certainly push roy carroll
1264114 stephen has looked very sharp in pre season and i am not disappointed especially with lewis price being injured
1264115 tottenham came in with a bid for stephen and the player is very keen to go which is fully understandable
1264116 id like to have kept him but its a move which appeals to him and we wish him well
1264117 he wants to stay at valencia from that starting point well see what happens but staying at valencia is his first choice
1264118 after that if other opportunities arise then well analyse them but at the moment hes very happy here
1264119 if in the next few days anything comes up which changes that then well have to weigh it up and make a decision

1264124 that is thanks to the help i have had and i am just waiting for the moment when i am ready to play again
1264125 yes it can be difficult at times because i have never been through something like this before but the worst part is done with

1264127 i hope that i will know exactly how long it will take me to be back in training with my team mates
1264128 i want to find out as well when they think i can play again my hope is that it will be before christmas every day i dream about when i get back on to the football pitch
1264129 i still dont know whether i will continue at real madrid its not defined yet
1264130 the season is just starting and ive been given some offers from other clubs i have one from chelsea but nothing has been sorted out yet we are just talking

1264371 any suggestion of a general direction by ibec to employers to the effect that they should refuse to engage with us would contravene most collective agreements and therefore raise the prospect of industrial unrest long before it would otherwise be anticipated
1264372 by telling their members not to engage in local collective bargaining they are laying the foundations for serious industrial unrest in this country
1264373 could still be possible if the social partners can show leadership in charting a way forward
1264374 if no national agreement emerges and where existing pay agreements have expired claims will be processed in line with established industrial relations procedures
1264375 simply not feasible for low paid workers who desperately need an increase in income in preparation for increased energy and food costs this winter
1264376 the reality is that the negotiations have broken down and there are no arrangements to reconvene there has been no indication from the employers they will adopt a more reasonable stance if the talks were to resume accordingly we have no alternative other than to press ahead with our claims directly on those employers
1264377 there is an inability to pay clause in social partnership agreements which has worked very well until now
1264378 that would be somewhat better than inflation for the lower paid whilst it might be something less than inflation for the better paid if such an agreement was supported by a government anti inflation strategy this would send out a very positive message about our economic management
1264379 obviously i wanted to ask him what do you think of the young guy
1264380 and he brought up some good points about his evaluation of practice
1264381 hes got a lot of talent and a lot going through his mind if they just keep it simple he seems to have a real good feel for it i think hes going to do good things
1264382 you can tell from offseason training until now hes getting comfortable with the offense
1264383 jamarcus has this presence when he comes in there its something that you cant teach a swagger its exciting to watch him you can just tell

1264399 we dont see a focus among suppliers and vendors like ourselves because everyone looks at their implementation individually rather than as an industry implementation

1264402 its always nice when wilson comes in and has a good clean inning
1264403 ive been part of some of his losses and ive seen some
1264404 its been heartbreaking you probably could flip eight or nine of those into wins
1264405 well see i havent been going at it as well as id like lately ive had some great at bats and hit the ball well and ill think all right its a step in the right direction then my next four at bats will be terrible its a day to day thing time will tell

1264407 theres a little bit of that let me show you but its balanced by the fact those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
1264408 anybody whos gone through that been beaten up a little bit theres going to be a confidence factor
1264409 not playing last year was probably one of the hardest things i ever had to go through period
1264410 while last year sucked and going through that was tough i dont feel like they were unfair to me if i look at it like an adult they gave me a fair shake
1264411 to be honest with you i wanted a fresh start somewhere else
1264412 i wanted to get out of this market and start all over
1264413 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging
1264414 you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of look at yourself in the mirror
1264415 in terms of going out there and feeling like i can get the job done i feel i can do that
1264416 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1264417 its private its between us and its not a big deal
1264418 from the outside looking in it probably seems like we should be pressing more trying to impress coach
1264419 but nothing changes mentally we are just trying to get the offense moving
1264420 all three of us are going to make plays we are all good football players there are going to be great spots and mistakes you have to look at the bigger picture
1264421 i expect to start but i dont expect it based on anything that happened last year or anything that happened in spring or anything thats happened thus far i expect to start by staying consistent the rest of this camp and proving that im the quarterback that gives this team the best chance to win
1264422 if you just go out and succeed in practice youre going to do it in a game
1264423 if you play well every day you should expect to do the same in a game maybe that experience factor that plays a little into it as far as handling pressure and being calm but i think we get that in practice too we had two spring games weve had multiple practices ive felt pressure ive had to be calm and cool and collected i think that experience has come in different ways for me
1264424 ive been told i should have stayed at michigan but thats all behind i couldnt ask for anything better if i win this job its because i earned it not because it was handed to me
1264425 if one of us makes a play subconsciously you know youve got to go up there and make a play youve got to have a short memory with a bad play and go out there and perform
1264426 in arkansas we had four or five pass protections the whole time i was there
1264427 i come out here you have 10 or 12 if youre a split second late youre going to miss him
1264428 i was just asking gore not to punch me in the face you know how it is we dont fight anymore we sue
1264429 thats how we want him to be at every practice not just because were going to play somebody else
1264430 im not into the whole well when the lights go on they play well thats not my deal
1264431 like i always said if things are important to you you will fight about it
1264432 we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work

1264443 also ive watched look whos talking and look whos talking too id be worried if the baby sounded like bruce willis
1264444 the best advice my dad has given me was go with your gut and he said you cant really have expectations if i have expectations that hes going to be a rock star im sure hell come out being into sports and if i have expectations that hell be into sports then hell be into math or something
1264445 i think its an aggressive way of doing a sponsorship
1264446 but should it be that way i dont think so but it seems to be the way we work in north america
1264447 the closure to cars has created a destination it creates an ambience that is impossible with cars
1264448 but here you have a product foisted on merchants and their customers it raises the question of how far we should allow private interests to have such control over our public spaces i think its a burden on merchants and it restricts public choice
1264449 these are the decisions we made on behalf of businesses on the street
1264450 it goes too far when they use a sponsorship to start telling dozens of private businesses what to do on public land over an entire summer

1264563 i dont think a rescue mission would be possible today
1264564 the weather is still bad flying in skardu and beyond was not possible this morning normally it takes two or three days to improve the weather in the area
1264565 our helicopters are ready waiting for an improvement in the situation they may try to make an attempt this evening if the weather improves even for a few hours
1264566 such missions are quick it may not take more than one or two hours to bring the climber down

1264575 we have a very strong position and i believe we can take better advantage of it this is a key priority for us
1264576 tomorrow there will be a meeting between president abbas and prime minister olmert in jerusalem
1264577 the helicopters are at standby as the weather in skardu baltoro glacier and the base camp remains inclement an attempt will be made as soon as the weather clears
1264578 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership

1264700 obviously its a pretty short time period to consider the past three months as a valid data set
1264701 but its an encouraging sign starting right out of the box
1264702 were getting an abundance of stocks that look attractive which is an indication that the markets trading cheap right now
1264703 were using the 2 000 largest stocks by market cap size
1264704 so weve got a flexible universe that we update every week that gives us an advantage over the indexes that are basically stuck in a group of stocks
1264705 we can change up to three stocks a week on a 50 stock portfolio like the one we use with pqz

1264711 it doesnt pass our screens because its pe price earnings ratio is too high

1264717 we really need to get brodie and tyler a bundle of snaps and get damon some just so he can stay in the mix
1264718 tyler is making nice progress but we really want to see him in a game theres really no other way to get a measure on a quarterback practice is practice the game is full speed
1264719 hes got all of the tools you can see that hes a poised guy i think he gets it he doesnt get flustered
1264720 that was one of his assets he was kind of a late bloomer our scouts liked him we could see how cerebral he was he moved coastal carolina along we knew then he was a real strong guy we could develop
1264721 there were a lot of rumors going around about that
1264722 im not exactly sure where those were coming from i think it was more that people were thinking that if it didnt work out at quarterback for me they could out me at slot receiver
1264723 during the time i was with the vikings somebody had mentioned something to me about playing receiver but i never did i was a quarterback the whole time i was up there
1264724 i feel very lucky but i know how much hard work ive put in to get here
1264725 ive always wanted to play in the olympics ive scratched and clawed for this moment and now that its here i really want to take advantage and show the world what i can do

1264794 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1264795 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there

1264797 there will be many more hours many more days of this protest this week sadly there is no window to show the broader world through television and photography what were doing in the house chamber
1264798 believe that congress should not go on vacation until we take action to lower gas and energy prices for struggling american families
1264799 for the last two months we and our house republican colleagues have used every tool at our disposal to try and get you and your democrat majority to vote on legislation to lower gas and energy prices
1264800 we think it is unconscionable that congress has gone on vacation before we have addressed the high gas prices that are crippling our economy and hurting millions of families we are asking that you reconvene the house from your five week vacation and schedule a vote on legislation to increase american energy production let us be clear we are not asking for a guaranteed outcome just the chance to vote
1264801 to go to work on the most important issue of the day and thats the rising gas prices

1264811 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1264812 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1264813 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1264814 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1264815 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1264816 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part
1264817 i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1264818 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1264819 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1264820 im sure if he had a calmer head he would have made better decisions i dont fault him for that there are times where i may want to hit somebody but i control myself i tell some of my other teammates you have to learn to keep your composure typically people do crazy things they regret when theyre emotional i think he just got too emotional at the time
1264821 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake
1264822 i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1264823 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1264824 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1264825 weve got to get him ready for the season and we have to get other people ready for the season also
1264826 we still have some more things to talk about as far as what we can we do to be able to go out there and coexist on the same field same team and be productive and help this team win this year
1264827 only two men can do that and we feel like we have what it takes in order to do so

1264935 today on the open spot market a gigabyte of mlc nand flash memory is about one third the price of a gigabyte of slc nand therefore a 64gb c200 laptop drive will be about one third the price of a 64gb p200 enterprise drive
1264936 we are convinced that on the very low end and on the very high end ssd will penetrate the notebook netbook markets but the mainstream notebook will remain hdd for the foreseeable future
1264937 progress in general on ssd adoption has been slower then we would of all preferred or predicted and the truth is wider adoption for ssd will probably take a bit longer
1264938 ssds age gracefully they degrade gracefully we can predict this based on your usage model how much longer that drive will last
1264939 typical raw nand write endurance is ten thousand cycles for mlc while slc is typically a hundred thousand cycles
1264940 the typical notebook user only writes two to four gigabytes per day even if you look at 40 or 60 gigabytes a day you still dont need the 10 000 cycles of mlc in five years
1264941 one of the things that ssd manufacturers have been slow to learn is that you cant just take a compact flash controller throw some nand on there and call it an ssd
1264942 the application of storing data on a notebook and certainly on the enterprise is far different than that controller was designed to support
1264943 weve got a lot of processing power in this controller weve got a very large dram buffer attached to this controller so having that dram buffer both allows us to increase the performance of the drive in addition to minimizing the wear

1264984 it was watching thomas nkono play that made me want to become a goalkeeper
1264985 when i think about what i experienced its more than a dream
1264986 as far as i could see that was unthinkable when i started my career
1264987 in 1979 i was still playing in cameroon and at the time african football had no media exposure it was in 1982 in spain during the world cup that my performances got noticed that event had a huge impact on my career
1264988 that was a major landmark in my career not so much in personal terms but above all because the disappointment brought the clubs remarkable upward progress to a halt
1264989 i made one of my best saves in that match
1264990 i was out near the penalty spot and the striker lobbed me i parried the ball on to the crossbar and then got hold of it by doing a forward roll

1265026 it basically destroyed my life financially but thats the price of a dream
1265027 the development wasnt able to materialize fast enough before the market crashed
1265028 it was rons concept and it was a good one
1265029 had the market not gone to where it went it had the potential to be successful
1265030 we wanted to create a community not just another subdivision
1265031 its more of an artists community for a certain market segment that wanted something different theres been enough people that have come through that would say what a wonderful concept but then the market crashed and everyone went home
1265032 people always come back to see whats happened with the development
1265033 the bank is probably going to discount everything quite heavily
1265034 whoever buys i hope theyre like minded and want to keep the same theme going but at the same time were realistic we might need to make some modifications with the economic climate in other words we dont need to have a thatched roof but it would be nice if similar architectural styles are kept
1265035 that someone was sent to my task force and came up with these great ideas
1265036 i kept minutes i got everyone together i invited i facilitated
1265037 people had already seen the first series it was hugely popular
1265038 you could almost see their dicks getting hard as they got new ideas
1265039 and i said to myself you know what i dont have a dick to get hard i can stay detached
1265040 this was not done by a bunch of people down in gitmo no way
1265041 they wanted to know what we were doing to get to this guy
1265042 and addington was interested in how we were managing it
1265043 they brought ideas with them which had been given from sources in d c
1265044 physical or mental torture threats insults or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or aid to interrogation

1265048 so long as the force used could plausibly have been thought necessary in a particular situation to achieve a legitimate government objective and it was applied in a good faith effort and not maliciously or sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm
1265049 examination of all facts under a totality of circumstances test

1265052 department of justice lawyers review the third category of techniques
1265053 jim pulled this away we never had a chance to complete the assessment
1265054 this was not the way this should have come about
1265055 that i wasnt aware of and jane wasnt aware of that was probably occurring between jim haynes white house general counsel and justice

1265057 the detainee arrives at the interrogation booth his hood is removed and he is bolted to the floor
1265058 look at this dont tell anyone where you got it
1265059 i was astounded that the secretary of defense would get within 100 miles of this issue
1265060 im pleased to tell you the secretary has rescinded the authorization
1265061 augmented techniques for guantanamo migrated to afghanistan and iraq where they were neither limited nor safeguarded

1265064 he gave his name as a soldier and a jurist of note and so helped to cloak the shameful deeds of that organisation from the eyes of the german people
1265065 military necessity can sometimes allow warfare to be conducted in ways that might infringe on the otherwise applicable articles of the convention
1265066 and then something unexpected happens when one of these lawyers travels to the wrong place
1265067 i stand for 8 10 hours a day why is standing limited to 4 hours
1265068 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person
1265069 i suspect that the individual techniques are less important than the fact that they were used over an extended period of time and that several appear to be used together in other words the cumulative effect
1265070 by getting the dogs close to him and then having the dogs bark or act aggressively on command
1265071 over the period of 54 days there is enough evidence of distress to indicate that it would be very surprising indeed if it had not reached the threshold of severe mental pain
1265072 if you put 12 clinicians in a room and asked them about this interrogation log you might get different views about the effect and long term consequences of these interrogation techniques but i doubt that any one of them would claim that this individual had not suffered severe mental distress at the time of his interrogation and possibly also severe physical distress
1265073 equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure impairment of bodily function or even death
1265074 suffering not just at the moment of infliction but lasting psychological harm
1265075 that it may be time to inquire as to whether there may be more flexibility in the type of techniques we use on him

1265078 dont bring the t jag s into the process they arent reliable
1265079 we have to support the geneva conventions if rumsfeld doesnt go along with this im going to contradict them in front of the president
1265080 there is no country in the world that has a larger interest in promoting respect for the geneva conventions as law than the united states
1265081 and there is no institution in the u s government that has a stronger interest than the pentagon
1265082 the geneva convention is a treaty in force it is as much part of the supreme law of the united states as a statute
1265083 i agree completely with what doug said and furthermore it is our military culture its not even a matter of whether it is a matter of who we are
1265084 people who should know better like yourself siding with the assholes to put it crudely
1265085 he evaluated me he wanted to know who i was he was very focused on the need to get intelligence he wanted to make sure that the moment was not lost
1265086 he wanted me to maximize the intelligence production no one ever said to me the gloves are off but i didnt need to talk about the geneva conventions it was clear that they didnt apply
1265087 i dont care who he is under he works for me
1265088 i have discussed this with the deputy doug feith and general myers

1265110 the american people have a great genius for splendid and unselfish actions into the hands of america god has placed the destinies of an afflicted mankind
1265111 the practice of morality being necessary for the well being of society he god has taken care to impress its precepts so indelibly on our hearts that they shall not be effaced by the subtleties of our brain we all agree in the obligation of the moral precepts of jesus and nowhere will they be found delivered in greater purity than in his discourses
1265112 the world has acheived brillance without wisdom power without conscience ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical midgets we know more about war than we know of peace more about killing than we know about living
1265113 in this apologia for christian faith keller mines material from literary classics philosophy anthropology and a multitude of other disciplines to make an intellectually compelling case for god written for skeptics and the believers who love them the book draws on the authors encounters as founding pastor of new yorks booming redeemer presbyterian church one of kellers most provocative arguments is that all doubts however skeptical and cynical they may seem are really a set of alternate beliefs drawing on sources as diverse as 19th century author robert louis stevenson and contemporary new testament theologian n t wright keller attempts to deconstruct everyone he finds in his way from the evolutionary psychologist richard dawkins to popular author dan brown the first shorter part of the book looks at popular arguments against gods existence while the second builds on general arguments for god to culminate in a sharp focus on the redemptive work of god in christ kellers condensed summaries of arguments for and against theism make the scope of the book overwhelming at times nonetheless it should serve both as testimony to the authors encyclopedic learning and as a compelling overview of the current debate on faith for those who doubt and for those who want to re evaluate what they believe and why
1265114 is how we live connected to something that has been in place since the beginning of time maybe jesus didnt come to start a new religion but to show us how to live in tune with the life god has always planned for us
1265115 in order for anyone christian atheist marxist or moslem to make informed moral decisions it is necessary to have a set of values concerning human life those values are determined by beliefs and thos beliefs are stated as doctrines christian doctrine thus provides a fundamental framework for christian living
1265116 our moral language assumes a universality we do not believe
1265117 no one can deny that our culture is opposed to christian values and the influences bombarding our childrens moral development can be deadly but few parents and church leaders realize how critical it is to start developing a childs biblical worldview from the very earliest years of life the problem is complex parents who themselves did not receive early spiritual training leave their childrens training to the church yet the church often focuses on older children not realizing that a childs moral development is set by the age of nine
1265118 how does a father instill these qualities in his son by raising a modern day knight beginning with a biblical perspective of manhood author pastor robert lewis shares a unique approach to shaping a boy into a man by equipping him with three essential elements a vision a code of conduct and a cause christianity in which to invest his life complete with ceremony ideas to celebrate accomplishments and ingrain them in his mind this softcover is as insightful as it is practical in raising a boy to be a chivalrous godly man
1265119 why do intelligent people sometimes behave in ways so stupid that they destroy their livelihoods or even their lives this book is the first to investigate the psychological basis for stupidity in everyday life experts shed light on the nature and theory of stupidity whether stupidity is measurable how people can avoid stupidity and its devastating consequences and much more
1265120 the way of change is through inner transformation and taking the small steps that lead one to it beginning with an introduction to spiritual formation the author then outlines the avenues through which transformation takes place including thoughts feelings choices social context the body and the soul

1265124 if we look at how the biological machinery of our cells carries out many different functions with a high level of specificity we can immediately identify a number of engineering principles that can be used to harness these sophisticated molecular machines for applications outside their usual environments
1265125 these engineering insights into how such tasks are carried out by the biological nanosystems will inevitably inspire new technologies that harness nanomotor driven processes to build new systems for nanoscale transport and assembly
1265126 understanding the details of how these little nanomachines convert chemical energy into controlled movements will nevertheless inspire new approaches to engineer synthetic counterparts that could some day be used under harsher conditions operate at more extreme temperatures or simply have longer shelf lives

1265166 ministers need to tell us what they are doing with this 100m a year taken from motorists how much is actually put back into practical road safety that does not involve speed cameras
1265167 ministers failure to answer that question confirms the view that for this government the british motorist is a nice little earner
1265168 is labour using speeding tickets just to raise revenue rather than making our roads safer using speed cameras as a cash cow undermines public confidence
1265169 the government needs to rethink ways of improving road safety including cracking down on uninsured drivers
1265170 safety cameras are there to save lives not make money
1265171 independent research has shown there are 1 745 fewer deaths and serious injuries at camera sites each year
1265172 the government is clear that the best safety camera is the one which takes no fines at all but succeeds in deterring drivers from speeding

1265198 the humidity in cincinnati was unbelievable it was well over 100 degrees 38 degrees celsius out on court
1265199 it comes from training and the gym work that you do off the court because that eliminates all your possible excuses
1265200 you get on the court thinking about tennis not worrying whether youve practised enough or done enough work in the gym i feel much better physically
1265201 quite a few of the tennis players are staying in hotels but i dont understand why theyre doing that
1265202 having made the decision to play in the olympics i wouldnt want to be staying anywhere other than in the village it will be a great experience to be around the best athletes in the world and to speak to some of them

1265242 many online gaming for the greater society companies go pel mel spending money when there is a good cash flow while there is nothing wrong with wanting to expand it has to be done in accordance with accounting standards and detailed record keeping this is especially true for public companies private online gaming for the greater society firms can sometimes let this aspect of the business slide alittle
1265243 if you walk up to someone and say ive got a great online gaming for the greater society business idea would you contribute 100k theyll probably laugh and consider you a lunatic but if you approach someone and say look i have this great idea and my plan is the following it will reassure an anxious investor that things will move forward with thought and purpose
1265244 in the case of our online gaming for the greater society marketing venture we initially started out with a simple website and then slowly grew as sales increased
1265245 then the website expanded into a data warehouse essentially a store of all things related to our marketing campaigns which allowed us to study and refine subsequent efforts
1265246 ive seen companies with nearly everything perfect budget great it good distribution but a terrible working dynamic between the employees though the online gaming for the greater society product makes it to store shelves the people working within the company feel miserable unappreciated and unmotivated
1265247 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the

1265264 david cook has got the better voice and david archuleta has got the teen and grandma appeal
1265265 doesnt have the raw sexual stage presence this song needs
1265266 singing in something close to his genre means he cant do the david cook thing of radically changing the songs arrangement so that m aybe hed have been better off with paul anka week
1265267 t he vocals all right but the stage moves arent she does sort of a half hearted tina impersonation down to the hair flipping move although i suppose the lame impression only hurts her with people whove actually seen tina turners act
1265268 flummoxed by syeshas need to reinterpret the lyrics of a song about the struggles to achieve rights for those to whom they had been denied as somehow reflecting on her idol journey

1265275 was the perfect nighttime serenade by the overstuffed musical teddy bear every 11 year old girl idol fan dreams of getting next valentines day
1265276 as far as im concerned competitions over were just having fun
1265277 b oth cook and archuleta picked songs that accentuated how they reached the finals with cook going away from convention and archuleta sticking with what had worked for him in the past
1265278 while rocker davids rendition may not have been a radical reinterpretation of the original and why should he be asked to clear that bar every stinkin time unless archie is asked to do the same it accomplished something even more impressive by making me hear every word of the well worn lyrics like i was hearing em for the first time
1265279 though the performance is true to his form he also does nothing different with the ballad and im a little surprised the judges show him as much love as they do
1265280 if simon meant to say that rocker david messed up by choosing a midtempo rocker over a maudlin bucket of balladry as chosen by david a then perhaps the british judge isnt as good as he thinks he is
1265281 u nlike cooks second round selection archuleta chose a song that was the usual sappy im so happy to be here treacle
1265282 archuletas big voice filled this song with all the sweet bombastic hoo hah it deserved
1265283 sorry not as good as the time you sang it the first time
1265284 of course reproducing your most famous widely praised idol performance requires no imagination at all

1265287 gas prices continue to fall at lowest level in nearly two months
1265288 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the online gaming field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet
1265289 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
1265290 be prepared for a wait of on average 3 5 years before expecting any sort of return that is the way the online gaming market works and with patience you can walk with big money
1265291 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the online gaming field quickly
1265292 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the online gaming market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
1265293 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
1265294 its better to look through the mid range online gaming companies for ones with strong growth potential
1265295 i always tell my online gaming clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
1265296 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
1265297 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
1265298 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows

1265312 safma is a regional organization safma should broadcast the problems of afghan journalists to the world
1265313 we would like to look into those aspects and to implement them whatever is possible to implement as fast as possible
1265314 the problem with the saarc is that is very rich in pronouncements and very poor in practice
1265315 in fact now there are nine bureaucracies within saarc secretariat itself who enter the whole process they even do not fulfill their responsibility towards us being an associate body for example they do not like civil society intervention in the processes
1265316 and we must recognize that that we are trailing behind and not living up to the expectations of the people
1265317 and in pakistan it is in the process of being legislated but despite the laws as such the right is not recognized legally even if it mentioned in the constitutions and in other countries there is no law we want that this right is recognized and practiced

1265355 we have been pushing for a compromise between legislative leaders and we will continue to push for a budget deal that includes budget reform
1265356 we all along have said everything should be on the table
1265357 we continue to be opposed to broad based rate increases especially in the face of a weak economy we do not think thats the way to go
1265358 we can balance this budget without tax increases and people should not have to pay dearly with their hard earned tax dollars to finally make the state implement real budget reform with real spending constraints
1265359 regressive which is bad but its a solution that might do the job

1265379 t he way brookes voice broke on the line i am i cried gave me chills and also made me realize that sensitive artists should never ever have to a condense a gorgeous ballad into 90 seconds and b look out into the audience and see a herd of generic white chicks robotically swaying their arms out of rhythm
1265380 while the kid continues to hit almost every one of his notes id be lying if i said i wasnt troubled by the disappearance of the contestant who nearly moved me to tears 10 weeks ago with his rendition of imagine every time archie takes the stage i feel like im watching a deleted scene from steven spielbergs a i artificial intelligence the power and precision are there but the heart and soul got lost somewhere on the build a better idol assembly line
1265381 couldnt have been more american cheesy if it had been wrapped in cellophane stamped with the word kraft a s simon noted while not uttering a word about the actual vocal it was a smart choice of song to send little davids fans into a speed dialing frenzy
1265382 like many of her performances the ballad is impeccable just not special or surprising
1265383 note for note syesha probably had the strongest week of any of the five finalists
1265384 actually not as well sung as syeshas first song but its better performed

1265431 your 401k has to be safeguarded that is your retirement fund
1265432 social security may not be there most people dont have pensions and most people arent saving enough so touching your 401k is the last sacred place to go
1265433 until you start taking it out its growing tax free
1265434 if you take it out before you are aged 59 and a half you pay whopping taxes ten percent penalty plus taxed as income for the year you are basically paying 28 30 possibly 35 percent on that money
1265435 you can take a loan from most plans and that can be a good idea for a number of reasons the interest you pay is lower than say what you would pay on a big credit card loan and you are paying it to yourself so thats a pretty good thing
1265436 getting a second job is a great thing and a very typical american thing that people dont do that much anymore but part of americas problems is that we lived pretty high on the hog for the last three decades really
1265437 people are not necessarily making enough money to support their lifestyles so you can either pull back on your lifestyle or increase your income if you can
1265438 it is a good idea to be looking to buy some things especially if you had a conservative allocation to begin with
1265439 so people who have a lot of bonds and cash should probably be looking around for stocks that seem inexpensive what you should be looking for is stocks that dont really depend on the economic cycle so technology issues are pretty well priced right now and also stocks that are either in overseas companies or american companies with considerable overseas operations

1265446 we hadden allemaal meer dan genoeg te doen en mobileme had zonder consequenties uitgesteld kunnen worden
1265447 de lancering van mobileme heeft duidelijk laten zien dat we meer te leren hebben over internetdiensten
1265448 en we zullen leren de visie van mobileme is spannend en ambitieus en we zullen zorgen dat het een dienst wordt waar we eind van dit jaar trots op zijn
1265449 we will only play the players who need the minutes
1265450 we are working towards the minutes on the pitch for everyone but we have a game on friday and we wont be quite as experienced at darlington
1265451 physically we have worked far harder than we have in other pre seasons and i think we are where we want to be
1265452 midos attitude has been excellent and he has given himself a base to work from
1265453 he had a difficult time last season with injuries so he wants to impress this time
1265454 he has only had two preseason run outs for us so its early for him hes still finding his feet fitness wise but hes a different type of player for us
1265455 hes done ok but he needs to do a little bit better and show us what hes got he certainly hasnt done enough so far to win a contract
1265456 were getting close to the start of the season so it was important we selected a team on saturday that was as near as we could get to one that might start against exeter
1265457 it was important that most of the team got 90 minutes under their belt
1265458 we were hoping andy was going to be fit but hes going to be out for another month or two
1265459 we think przemyslaw is going to be an excellent keeper but hes not quite ready and i didnt want to be going into the season with two youngsters so i wanted some experience in
1265460 simons been around a bit hes played at the top level in scotland so hes adding a bit of composure behind the defence
1265461 we had a bit of interest last week and the chances are hell be gone this week said coppell
1265462 if nothing happens then it will be a massive disappointment for him
1265463 playing left back is no problem at all the most important thing is to be playing and its nice to be involved in the team again
1265464 you can see the players weve brought in and i think theyre a sign of some big things happening at the club
1265465 im not looking to off load any players if we think a good offer comes in we might consider it but in terms of the players who p l a y e d against ajax id be very reluctant to let any of them go
1265466 we honour contracts in this part of the world so i dont get the level of worry that roy is not going to sign a new contract
1265467 roy is very professional and his focus is legendary we dont go for little pat on the back meals together but what we do is business together
1265468 the transfer window closing will probably be the time to get ourselves in that situation and get our way forward to making an announcement later on in the year
1265469 if it happens next month christmas january im very relaxed about it
1265470 made a lot of buzz early on and fell completely flat
1265471 everyone has done their own programmes when they were away and came back in great shape said the leftback who will sport the no 3 shirt next season with new signing ritchie jones taking over his no 8 shirt
1265472 its been hard a lot of track sessions double sessions and the like but thats what you need
1265473 throughout the season you have seen players who have missed pre season and struggled later
1265474 im really pleased with pre season all you can do is get enough minutes on the board to get match fit
1265475 weve enjoyed some really good play at times we had two games in two days last weekend and during the season you get fixtures played in quick succession so it stands you in good stead
1265476 if we had some multi billionaire that wanted a stake in the club it would help
1265477 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
1265478 people will look at the situation and make their own minds up
1265479 but our job is to try to fulfil all the promise weve got in the squad
1265480 we dont know and neither do the other teams what lies ahead for us in terms of injuries suspensions and luck
1265481 its a very tough league the premier league but at this stage theres no reason why we cant have our dreams
1265482 ill miss a lot of things but i sure as hell wont miss the weather
1265483 theres a heineken cup game against perpignan that stands out as a really great occasion
1265484 theres a league game against london irish where i thought we were really impressive but the thing ill remember most is the number of games at kingston park where i thought i was going to die from hypothermia
1265485 there was one match in particular against wasps where we had a kick to win but dave walder had to take it because i couldnt even feel my feet
1265486 it was so cold and thats the one thing the australian in me will take away with him
1265487 its disappointing that i didnt get to hold up a cup
1265488 even it had been the european challenge cup it would have been great
1265489 but i e n j o y e d my time at newcastle immensely
1265490 maybe some of the results didnt really go our way in relation to where we wanted to finish on the ladder but i enjoyed myself every single day i was here it was a great finish to an enjoyable career
1265491 there have been no firm coaching offers yet although i was stopped in a fruit shop the other day and asked to go down to my local rugby club to help out
1265492 its something id love to get involved with eventually but for the time being the most important thing is getting the family back settled in australia
1265493 weve been away for more than three years now so were going to have to try to lose that geordie accent

1265499 eine kologisch orientierte besteuerung dieser fahrzeuge ist f r die bundesregierung ein notwendiger baustein um ihre angestrebten co2 minderungsziele zu erreichen

1265501 steuergelder f r diesen dienstwagen bis zu 50 000 euro
1265502 wir bergeben dem finanzminister heute unseren vorschlag f r eine reform der besteuerung von firmen und dienstwagen

1265509 the boards action is against the interests of the nation and risks the safety of thousands of american traveling and living abroad
1265510 we must now rely on the u s supreme court to prevent texas from breaking a commitment made by the president and senate on behalf of the country as a whole
1265511 mr medellin raised that issue before the trial in pre trial he didnt raise the issue and he didnt raise the issue during the trial
1265512 if he had raised the issue at his probable cause hearing the court would have complied and it was never raised
1265513 they dont care about jennifer they dont care about elizabeth
1265514 the financial market turbulence continues but despite this we are strongly capitalised and our investment portfolio remains sound
1265515 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1265516 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point its focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1265517 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved
1265518 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1265519 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1265520 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1265521 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1265522 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1265523 hes been the best ambassador our state has ever had
1265524 he could live anywhere in the world and he came back home
1265525 i just think it shows a lot about him as a person and how grounded he is
1265526 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1265527 tomorrow there will be a meeting between president abbas and prime minister olmert in jerusalem
1265528 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1265529 iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia
1265530 while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1265531 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1265532 net borrowings provided by the bank of england have reduced to 17 5 billion pounds compared with 26 9 billion pounds at the end of december 2007 and are ahead of the business plan
1265533 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1265534 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1265535 hong kong clearly remains an attractive market and an important growth engine for us in the region
1265536 we have a very strong position and i believe we can take better advantage of it this is a key priority for us
1265537 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1265538 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1265539 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1265540 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1265541 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1265542 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1265543 the choice of the ibolt integration suite to synchronize our it systems will allow us to make great cost and work time savings

1265546 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1265547 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1265548 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1265549 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1265550 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1265551 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1265552 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1265553 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1265554 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1265555 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1265556 isabella when are you going to stop fooling around with these nuts
1265557 we have reached the ultimate limit it cannot reasonably go any higher
1265558 reducing by 25 per cent the cost of rentals in all senegalese main and secondary cities his suggestion was not heeded
1265559 its not rare to rent a small single room at fcfa 40 or 50 000 sh11 400 per month or the most insignificant house or two bed room flat at 150 000 sh34 200

1265573 china has focused on strengthening security and protection around olympic venues and at the olympics village so beijing is already prepared to respond to any threat

1265575 this has all the hallmarks of an innocent man who was walking home when he was attacked
1265576 i appeal to anyone who was in the area at the time and who saw anything suspicious to contact us
1265577 the deterioration in the housing market and the broader economic environment coupled with the evident stresses on household budgets as a result of rising food and fuel prices have put pressure on the companys loan books
1265578 it is worth reminding ourselves why we did this there was a risk it might not have been northern rock but other banks could have gone under as well
1265579 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1265580 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction

1265678 the auction houses and buyers often cant tell the difference
1265679 a large number of fakes are finding their way into auctions everywhere
1265680 in france one of the areas where this has really hit the business theres a laundering of these fake ceramics because traditionally france has always had a large number of private collections and in the old days that was where all the great finds and discoveries were made
1265681 it has spoilt the whole industry because people have no confidence
1265682 certainly the rapid rise in prices and the wider participation of new buyers in the market have given greater incentive to fakers to do the best they can
1265683 the exquisite matter thats made to fool professionals these we dont see that often on the market
1265684 i think the game has been the same for the past few decades but the knowledge needs to be updated its always been a challenge and well have to continue to keep those fakes from jingdezhen in check itll continue to be an area where we have to be increasingly vigilant
1265685 if you buy without knowledge privately and are tempted by a low price then the risk will be larger
1265686 there are pieces that are publicised in the newspapers having set record prices where an experienced collector or dealer takes one look and says not a chance that its old its just part of a game thats going on

1265775 an meiner k rperlichen und mentalen leistungsgrenze sp re ich das leben
1265776 this is not a script you can knock out in six months
1265777 when i was composing the music for the award ceremony i was thinking what makes a champion
1265778 did kid rock rip you off or is it coincidence
1265779 we didnt have no internet but man i never will forget the way the moonlight shined upon her hair
1265780 it was a little stiff in the fourth and it came back in the fifth
1265781 we think its muscular we dont really think its a serious injury im not really concerned that hell be shut down for a while
1265782 like i said the strength and everything was fine if it was a serious thing the strength and velocity wouldnt have been fine
1265783 its difficult for my team difficult for myself difficult for everybody
1265784 i was trying to go outside and i think i just left it a little bit up
1265785 there has been a little buzz surrounding john edwards and his alleged affair
1265786 because the only source has been the national enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumours or salacious speculations
1265787 you are violating site standards referencing the enquirer and its edwards coverage a bannable offense
1265788 sometimes the national enquirer reports things better than the washington post
1265789 whatever is going on with edwards i can tell you unequivocally that i am uninvolved
1265790 he did a good jb i told him he was one guy who had an impressive spring that we really counted on
1265791 he dislocated his kneecap in camp last year and the soreness he is experiencing now is connected to that injury so we will have to wait and see on him
1265792 but i got to hear great he feels good he will be available tonight
1265793 i have had blisters before its just another one of those things
1265794 we were losing sunday after the angels grand slam and i shaved it off
1265795 the clubhouse kids wanted to save it and sell it but who knows what you would find in there
1265796 he tried every thing he could to not have the surgery
1265797 but there was no other choice it was a significant problem and if we kept trying things there was going to be no chance he would be ready for next season
1265798 he might not be 100 percent the first day but as he builds arm strength he will be throwing and he will be there
1265799 its not easy being here while the guys are playing
1265800 my intent was that it was a significant injury and i mentioned that he shouldnt try
1265801 he said i am trying anyway he didnt want surgery and then we went through a period we didnt think he could justify playing catcher when he couldnt throw he said he could hit
1265802 he said he felt okay but i have to hear that he feels great
1265803 the last couple weeks hes been swinging the bat pretty good but i thought a day or two couldnt hurt him physically
1265804 hes been playing a lot hell be back out there
1265805 hes not 100 percent at this point but we expect that after a few minor league appearances he should be able to help somebody in september and in october
1265806 its a little stiff thats why i am going back and get it straightened out
1265807 hopefully i will miss one start if thats the case
1265808 life is too short to worry the strength is good
1265809 i made two bad pitches and they did what they are supposed to do
1265810 i tried to throw my best pitch a fastball a way
1265811 thats what you want a player to say well get it straightened out
1265812 hes been really good for us no matter what weve asked him to do
1265813 wherever weve put him hes done the job so we felt he had earned that right
1265814 its going to be a big time homecoming for me
1265815 i wasnt expecting it at all for it to be in anaheim thats going to be awesome thats the stadium i went to as a kid all the time
1265816 je suis venu parce que dans les ann es 70 jai lu ce petit livre qui a tout chang pour moi

1265821 your work is going to be affected by distractions no matter what you say
1265822 weve been able to go about our business with a limited amount of things and thats been good wed obviously like to have everybody on the field thats the frustrating part about being a coach moving on now looking at your first preseason game and knowing full well what these weeks are going to be like for us
1265823 didnt seem like it was going to be anything serious
1265824 well probably try to play them all eli just a little bit and then play the other guys
1265825 the strength is there but its more that i cant locate or finish the pitch
1265826 if its just a strain or muscle spasm then rest would be the best medication and not a stint on the dl
1265827 ive done nothing wrong since i was drafted by the giants
1265828 there is no question about that it should be over with all of this comes from the juvenile offense
1265829 youve just got to grow from your mistakes thats what i did and thats how i look at it i was there for a reason and now i just have to learn from it
1265830 it just kept going on the situations i had in college and it just kept it rolling
1265831 those are the things that have kept this thing going since i was 15
1265832 ill do whatever i have to do to get through this
1265833 it really doesnt matter who you are everything gets put in the papers it doesnt matter if youre joey the milkman whoever
1265834 regardless of if you go to the super bowl or not you got to learn from your mistakes and get punished for it
1265835 of course its always going to be in the back of your head
1265836 with me when im on the field im in another mind state and i just go out there and play my game its a relief just to be here around all of these guys and just to be a part of this team
1265837 gm brian cashman was trying to get a catcher as soon as i went down i think pudge just kind of fell into his lap
1265838 december is when well put a ball in his hand
1265839 he will be a throwing catcher in the big leagues
1265840 im not god so i cant tell you for certain that his velocity and location will be the same that hell be the posada of old
1265841 someone in the stands came up and told me i was involved in the trade
1265842 things just got fast paced and i didnt know what to expect when coke came out of the game i thought he was either going to the big leagues or he was involved in a trade one of the two
1265843 it was kind of a whirlwind of oh my goodness what do i do
1265844 i didnt sleep that night i didnt pack anything i just kind of hung out when i got the call from franklin the next day it was just like i can finally go to sleep now i dont have to worry about packing
1265845 a lot of names are bandied about for possible trade talks and for whatever reason one or two names are omitted from the trade and the trade goes through without one or two of those names initially mentioned
1265846 graduated high school the same year could actually relate to the same songs things like that
1265847 he can give the history of football playing in the leather helmets like he did
1265848 hes not just a milk truck he has a little bit of wiggle
1265849 im sure through arthritis and everything maybe a little bit restricted but he still has some fluidness
1265850 coach will be talking to guys about how to take care of their bodies how to prolong their careers and hell say ask t rich hes been in the league 27 years
1265851 once i talked to coach mangini and the direction he wanted to take the team i just felt it was a natural fit
1265852 hes savvy and he understands how the play is supposed to work
1265853 and he understands how the play is supposed to work when what was drawn in the book doesnt show up on the field hes one of those players that gets concepts
1265854 i think we all kind of take that same approach
1265855 if our running backs are able to go out and have a big day its the fact that the job got done it doesnt matter who gets the glory its the fact that the job gets done
1265856 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion

1265860 el nuevo presidente que remplazar al presidente bush no cambiar su pol tica de irak su pol tica ser la misma en lo que respecta a la ocupaci n irak no ver cambios no creo que l cambie nada porque todos tenemos claro cu l es la pol tica estadounidense
1265861 si usted fuera presidente y el gobierno iraqu manifestara que quiere que se establezca un plazo para la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses estar a de acuerdo con eso
1265862 he estado all muchas veces me he reunido muchas veces con l y s lo que quieren quieren imponer condiciones y por supuesto que quieren que nos vayamos eso es lo que sucede cuando se ganan guerras
1265863 el senador obama expres que est comprometido a apoyar a afganist n y a continuar con la guerra contra el terrorismo con vigor
1265864 ver como gente joven est haciendo un trabajo excelente con tanta dedicaci n y orgullo simplemente me hace sentir bien por el pa s y quiero asegurarme de que todo el mundo en nuestro pa s entienda cu nto se enorgullecen estas personas de su trabajo y cu ntos sacrificios est n haciendo es extraordinario
1265865 la situaci n aqu est empeorando es incluso peor que la de irak si el gobierno estadounidense env a a m s soldados la violencia aumentar por ejemplo cuando vemos a un grupo de soldados estadounidenses caminando por aqu no nos hace sentir seguros nuestras fuerzas afganas son capaces de proveerle seguridad a afganist n el gobierno estadounidense deber a enfocarse en otras necesidades de los afganos no en las fuerzas armadas
1265866 no ha habido cambios en la vida de los afganos comunes y corrientes las visitas y la presencia de los extranjeros no han cambiado la vida de los afganos pobres regres de ir n luego de haber estado all durante 20 a os viv a mejor cuando estaba en ir n ahora debo trabajar como un animal en mi pa s para alimentar a mi familia mi vida es peor ahora en qu nos beneficia que estos funcionarios occidentales est n yendo y viniendo
1265867 estoy aqu para reafirmar la relaci n especial entre israel y estados unidos mi compromiso permanente con la seguridad de israel y mi esperanza de poder ser un socio eficaz ya sea como senador o como presidente de estados unidos para traer una paz m s duradera a la regi n
1265868 esta postura significa que no existe ni la m s m nima esperanza de que haya cambios en la pol tica exterior de estados unidos en lo que respecta al conflicto rabe israel y esto significa que estamos ante una nica pol tica estadounidense y el pueblo palestino deber a depender de s mismo y del mundo rabe y musulm n para enfrentar esta pol tica estadounidense que est siendo adoptada tanto por el partido dem crata como por el republicano
1265869 a nadie le gusta la guerra reconozco las tremendas dificultades de afganist n pero tanto a mi pa s como al de ustedes le interesa que la primera misi n de la otan fuera de las fronteras de europa sea un xito debemos hacer esto por el pueblo de afganist n y por nuestra seguridad conjunta estados unidos no puede hacerlo solo
1265870 me esposaron y me pusieron al sol durante tres horas despu s me levantaron y me hicieron caminar un rato y luego me dispararon cuando me di cuenta estaba en el piso me dijeron te vamos a disparar una bala de goma y nunca me imagin que fueran a hacer eso a abrir fuego contra m mientras estaba esposado
1265871 esta pol tica deber a ser condenada a nivel internacional mediante las organizaciones de derechos humanos y deber an ser castigados por un tribunal internacional y no por un tribunal israel a fin de cuentas liberar n a este oficial despu s de un mes o dos o un per odo de tiempo corto ante los medios estar encarcelado pero no en la realidad
1265872 muy severo y que har quedar muy mal a israel
1265873 lo importante es que decidimos utilizar este dinero para ayudar al gobierno democr ticamente electo de pakist n a combatir a un enemigo que tenemos en com n consideramos que estas modernizaciones que ya fueron aprobadas ayudar n a los paquistan es a nosotros ayudar n a los paquistan es a que nos ayuden a combatir a este enemigo com n y creemos que esta es una forma positiva de ayudar a un amigo

1265875 aunque una convicci n honesta no necesariamente debe ser razonable tal convicci n es m s f cil de establecer si hay un fundamento razonable para la misma
1265876 la ausencia de mala intenci n invalida los cargos de tortura
1265877 estos documentos proporcionan m s pruebas si es que eran necesarias de que el departamento de justicia autoriz a la cia a torturar a los prisioneros a su cargo el departamento de justicia tergivers la ley y en algunos casos incluso la ignor para permitir que los interrogadores utilizaran m todos atroces que en una poca estados unidos consider cr menes de guerra
1265878 mukasey le est pidiendo al congreso que expanda y extienda la guerra contra el terrorismo por siempre cualquier persona declarada un terrorista por este o el pr ximo presidente podr a ser detenida por tiempo indeterminado sin derecho a un juicio
1265879 por qu hemos confiado en contratistas privados para entrenar en seguridad de combate a nuestras fuerzas

1265884 siento que se ha hecho justicia que verdaderamente este genocida represor como luciano benjam n men ndez se va a pudrir en la c rcel como se merece
1265885 est acusado de genocidio de ser c mplice de un genocidio de asesinato de exterminio de tratos crueles de tortura etc una gran serie de cr menes cometidos en bosnia herzegovina entre marzo y diciembre de 1992 cuando la rep blica serbio bosnia fue declarada y radovan karadzic era el presidente pero tambi n los cr menes cometidos desde 1992 hasta noviembre de 1995 entre ellos el genocidio de srebrenica
1265886 si es culpable debe ser arrestado pero es menos culpable que otros que siguen en libertad s lo arrestan a los serbios

1265889 evil can and must be resisted even in the darkest hours of history
1265890 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do and you have to balance up what really matters
1265891 if you try to do everything differently youll scare the horses and under mmp its very hard to win
1265892 once we have gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1265893 we may be able to do some things we believe we need to do perhaps go through a discussion document process you wouldnt be able to do them straight off im hoping that well do some useful things that way that may not be policy right now
1265894 tsja suzy als het niet anders kan het gaat om jou

1265897 two things are at work first the way deferred revenue works ea recognizes revenue on xbox 360 over six months following the sale but does not do so for ps3 so sales of xbox 360 games during the last two quarters battlefield bad company and army of two are rolling through till december while sales of ps3 games are booked when sold second some of eas sales are skewed in europe where uefa euro 2008 and battlefield probably sold a little better on ps3 and with rock band launching in europe this year also skewed ps3 ubisoft was because of haze which was a ps3 exclusive
1265898 why would ea recognize revenue differently for the ps3 than it does for the xbox 360
1265899 prior to fiscal 2008 we were able to determine vsoe vendor specific objective evidence vendor specific money for the layman ed for the online service to be delivered therefore we were able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately however starting in fiscal 2008 vsoe does not exist for the online service to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions are recognized over the estimated online service period

1265919 why we should bear any sort of obligations from the government
1265920 an analysis of inpatient bed figures shows a net gain of 10 beds since 2005 this is what the health minister has to show after three full years and a 40 billion spend three inpatient beds a year
1265921 in november 2006 mary harney provided an answer in the dail claiming that the governments commitment to increase total acute bed capacity is virtually complete in fact by that time the total number of inpatient beds had fallen by 42 during the ministers first full year of tenure
1265922 this would be risible if it wasnt for the thousands of patients tragically affected by the ministers ineptitude in health the 200 patients on trolleys each day in july can blame the ministers abject failure to increase capacity

1265932 after six days jesus took peter james and john with him and led them up a high mountain where they were all alone there he was transfigured before them his clothes became dazzling white whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them and there appeared before them elijah and moses who were talking with jesus
1265933 dhs officials said the policies applied to anyone entering the country including u s citizens and were needed to prevent terrorism
1265934 the policies require federal agents to take measures to protect business information and attorney client privileged material they stipulate that any copies of the data must be destroyed when a review is completed and no probable cause exists to keep the information
1265935 the complexity and lack of flexibility of traditional knowledge sharing solutions are driving the interest in solutions that are easy to use and that adapt to an organizations needs

1265946 canberra has the highest percentage of public servants than anywhere in australia and they retire a decade earlier than the rest of australia
1265947 it depends on what the mix is i expect the mix will be fairly broad which would be widely welcomed by the business community but all of those wont solve our problem
1265948 within the banking sector they are far more aware of the risk associated with certain products they are seeking people with extensive risk analyst type skills

1265972 musa bin imran the prophet moses peace be upon him once asked the lord o lord who are the noblest of bondsmen in your sight those who forgive the guilty when they have him her in their control and are in a position to take revenge the lord replied
1265973 once person came to the prophet peace be upon him and said o prophet how many times should i forgive the fault of my attendant slave or servant the prophet kept quiet the questioner then asked again how many times should i forgive the fault of my attendant slave or servant seventy times each day replied the prophet
1265974 do not be of those who do by others as the others do by them and say that we will do them a favour if they do us a favour and if they will be mean and unjust to us then we too will be mean and unjust to them on the contrary resolve that you will do good if others do good and if they do a wrong and act unjustly even then you will not be unfair to them

1266010 when i step on the line in beijing ill be ready to go
1266011 every games seems to have that one moment that just grabs the canadian publics imagination that moment when everyone is tuned in
1266012 it can even be the reaction of the athlete sometimes when i went over the bar my arms went up in the air for years people would come up to me stick their arms in the air and say i know you
1266013 no one knew our names we werent supposed to contend
1266014 its a way to encourage the victims to rebuild the torch is a symbol of strength and will encourage them to carry on the tenacious struggle
1266015 i was pretty damn close to achieving what i wanted to achieve which was a medal
1266016 i think theres hunger and a bit of revenge in mind for beijing
1266017 im always motivated to race for canada because i dont get the opportunity to do it too much
1266018 i think its a lot different from when i was a kid
1266019 when i was a kid i had a dream but i think it has changed and a lot of that has become reality
1266020 im still very passionate about the sport some of the greatest days i have in the year are out riding with my friends in the mountains
1266021 people struggle to find things they really love to do
1266022 if you have an opportunity to make a living doing something you love its unique
1266023 theres no doubt its frustrating but you just train hard eat well and try to get your sleep
1266024 its nice to come back to a family as well because it definitely puts everything in life into perspective
1266025 i think when youre just living your life as an athlete its easy to become singularly focused and not see 10 years down the road 15 years down the road 20 years down the road
1266026 definitely when you have a family it changes things quite a bit
1266027 do i want to speak of the miracle of our lords divine transformation not really no i dont want to talk about his divinity id rather talk about his humanity i mean you know how he lived his life here on earth his kindness his tolerance listen heres what i think

1266030 the mayor of beijing wanted the chinese people to make a good impression on the world
1266031 it was believed necessary to instruct our fans in when to cheer and how to cheer when is the appropriate time to speak or to take pictures the campaign i think has been very successful
1266032 interactions are necessary for a basketball competition which can arouse players enthusiasm audience should be passionate but not manic and enthusiastic but not out of control
1266033 during a short distance track event as a referee gives an order of on your mark spectators must be in absolute silence so that athletes can focus during some long distance races like the marathon spectators should not cross the barrier to pass water towel etc to athletes
1266034 audience could be easily out of control when watching an exciting competition therefore during a football match audience must keep calm and treat victory or defeat correctly riot burning of sportswear besieging referees and players are strictly prohibited
1266035 china has 5 000 years of cultural history but a lot of olympic events are western sports
1266036 our people didnt know the rules so they had to be taught
1266037 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village
1266038 we are well prepared to deal with any kinds of threats
1266039 no hay un pueblo queno se haya cre do el pueblo elegido
1266040 el xito no se asegura con el control sino con la gesti n
1266041 let us then approach the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace in time of need
1266042 i dont know her reasons for saying what she did but it doesnt matter i try to ignore anything negative that would take my attention away from diving
1266043 shes a phenomenal diver whos dominated the 3 metre springboard for many years and shes definitely popular with fans really it will be great to watch her compete in beijing
1266044 i never received an apology but i wasnt waiting for one either
1266045 there are pros and cons to putting all your eggs in one basket but ive been really happy just concentrating on springboard
1266046 last year was the most difficult year of my life
1266047 the hardest thing me and my family have ever been through last summer all of us just felt broken i had no motivation to do anything i couldnt even get out of bed in the morning it didnt seem plausible physically mentally emotionally that i would ever be able to devote myself to the training and preparation that is necessary for the olympics i thought maybe i should throw in the towel
1266048 strachan only did good in this world he was the last person that this should have happened to
1266049 even through the roller coaster of his treatment i always believed that he would beat cancer because he always beat everything
1266050 he lived with such intensity he wanted to make a difference theres no textbook on how to recover from losing a loved one but my whole family drew strength and inspiration from the courage strachan displayed
1266051 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong
1266052 its like you changing from a newspaper to another newspaper
1266053 this is for me a living and a job and a business and at times you change employers nine years is a long time so this team means more to me in my life than most teams ive coached
1266054 we have been in residency camp for two years its almost like a club so of course i will miss that part no doubt about it
1266055 i think some people are thinking about it but the main focus right now is the olympics
1266056 ive been here pretty much since pellerud joined and i really enjoyed working with him and its a pleasure but the same with a lot of the players theyll be done after the olympics too for a lot of us its kind of our last go so it makes it even more important for us to do well
1266057 its one thing to play before the whole hype starts its easier to be level minded youre focused and were away from the venue too so that helps
1266058 i just cant wait for china in china that games going to be crazy
1266059 for me the olympics is work its my area of specialization so i record it all and watch it with all sorts of research in mind
1266060 we get calls for information on every aspect of the olympics
1266061 the number of calls we get as the olympics approach can get downright silly i got 36 media calls in one day
1266062 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
1266063 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
1266064 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
1266065 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
1266066 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
1266067 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high
1266068 about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
1266069 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
1266070 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
1266071 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
1266072 but i got into writing to because i dont like to make human contact on a regular basis cant i just sit at my desk and produce my breathtaking work of art

1266078 very nice well ive got to finish getting ready thanks again and have a good night
1266079 why did i not check the size of top on the model
1266080 oh well not this month but at the rate i am going i can get it next month or so
1266081 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
1266082 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
1266083 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
1266084 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
1266085 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
1266086 for example parents could sit with their child on an ordinary train first then sit with them somewhere dark then perhaps have games where people jump out and say boo gradual ways to decrease fear
1266087 the problem now is a lot of parents can tend to wrap their children in cotton wool because parents can be quite scared of the world as well and that can rub off on children
1266088 it is important that kids are not taught to see the world as an overwhelmingly scary place
1266089 if the swiss commissions conclusions were adopted at a community level and resulted in reduced condom use it would be likely to lead to substantial increases in infection
1266090 while it is true that the individual risk of hiv transmission per act is fairly small for people on antiretrovirals the risk of transmission over large numbers of acts could be substantial
1266091 when the viral load goes down in the blood due to antiretrovirals it might not go down in the semen or vaginal and anal fluids
1266092 this may be confusing antiretrovirals can complement consistent condom use but replacing condom use with medications may end in disaster
1266093 people who are diagnosed with hiv infection tend to reduce their number of new sexual partners use condoms more consistently and disclose their status to their current partner or partners
1266094 we are concerned that there may not be the same behaviour if people believe themselves to be non infectious
1266095 we were delighted to find that this product significantly reduced frost damage to my trees
1266096 this was the first time glycine betaine has been scientifically trialled on olives in new zealand although it has previously been used successfully on other crops worldwide
1266097 glycine betaine already has a role in body metabolism so the increased levels found in the olives could actually be a positive feature
1266098 similarly polynesians are known to have spread chickens across the pacific at least as far as easter island but were not thought to have introduced them to south america
1266099 the results showed that the ancient polynesian and chilean chickens possessed a genetic sequence that is the most common in the world today the so called kfc gene
1266100 this sequence would undoubtedly have been common in the early spanish chickens and therefore provides no evidence of polynesian contact so while we can say the kfc chicken was popular amongst early polynesian voyagers we certainly cant use it as evidence for trade with south america
1266101 this is important because easter island is commonly thought of as a major jumping off point for polynesian contact with south america
1266102 this study does not disprove this idea but we have found no evidence to support pre historic contact
1266103 we dont have all the answers nobody does but before we start laying bricks and mortar we have got to get the foundations right otherwise the cathedral will tumble with the smallest of tremors
1266104 by examining fossil and molecular evidence we could clearly see that the global centre of marine mega diversity was over western europe and africa in the eocene around 50 million years ago a time when there was a shallow ocean called tethys between the two continents
1266105 by the start of the miocene around 25 million years ago the hotspot of sea life had moved to the region of the arabian peninsula pakistan and west india an area that is still quite rich today and was starting to appear in the east asia region
1266106 then in more recent times the global centre of the action hops to the indo asian australian region which is the greatest hotspot of marine biodiversity today leaving an ageing arabian fauna to senesce
1266107 in each of these cases we think that the emergence of many species and their gradual dwindling can be largely explained by plate tectonics as well as climate change
1266108 the evidence seems to be saying that when habitats are disrupted increasing in area and highly variable you get more species when they are reduced in size and number and become more consistent the range of species declines
1266109 as continents merge tectonically seas close up nutrients increase currents subside and the range of habitats and species also declines this period of senescence is of particular interest as it is important to understand whether species richness in a particular area is declining naturally due to tectonic changes or due to man made changes
1266110 this shows for example that most cowrie shell species and coral reef fishes appeared around 20 million years or more ago and very few have evolved in the recent past this contradicts a popular assumption that many coral reef species appeared in the last few million years
1266111 because they occur over such huge time scales there has been a tendency to discount the role of tectonic changes in the development of life but we are suggesting here that it is in fact one of the major driving forces
1266112 we can see from the fossil record how many tropical organisms are hitch hiking round the planet as conditions change

1266115 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children whove been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma antibiotics are then given to treat this respiratory condition which may or may not be asthma and are not a cause as has been previously suggested
1266116 however our study still leaves open the possibility that antibiotics have something to do with the development of eczema and itchy skin by four years and allergic hypersensitivity by 15 months
1266117 there is a digital divide in australia and it reflects patterns of uptake that are repeated elsewhere in the prosperous west if youre male employed or studying if you have a university degree and a higher than average income you are more likely to be online
1266118 is an ambitious collaborative world wide attempt to map something that was until very recently unthinkable
1266119 to tell us a great deal about who we now are or more precisely who australians are becoming in the new era of networks
1266120 will help us gauge the real prospects for turning australia into one of those new desirable knowledge economies based on innovation and creativity
1266121 the same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia so it is able to breathe oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic
1266122 the benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process
1266123 our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars increasingly improbable
1266124 the cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100kw electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100kw gasoline engine also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100kw vehicles less than one twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles
1266125 the small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned eventually destroying the cell
1266126 the important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical more easily sourced outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective
1266127 fuel leaks are one of the most widespread forms of contamination in australia and elsewhere
1266128 former service station sites fuel farms garages workshops gasometers oil spills dry cleaners and factories which used or processed hydrocarbons or explosives are literally everywhere that has been closely settled for the past century or so
1266129 you just add the bacteria to btex contaminated water and they go straight to work
1266130 the reason is that no two contaminated sites are the same the soils the groundwater the temperature the mix of contaminants are always different we want to see how the bugs perform in as wide a range of conditions as possible
1266131 we have proved that this technology works in the laboratory we know the bugs can be used to detect and break down btex efficiently we now want to take them to the next stage and develop the technology for practical application in industry or any urban setting
1266132 traditional plant breeding is restricted to a closed pool of genes from which new varieties are developed according to the laws of nature grasses cross with grasses fruits cross with fruits corn with other varieties of corn natural species boundaries would dictate the limits of breeding

1266139 committed to getting the right equipment for the canadian forces at the right price for canadians with the right benefits for canadian industry
1266140 as the procurement process has not been completed yet it would be inappropriate to comment further
1266141 having some kind of replenishment capability for the navy is vital so this is a serious issue
1266142 the ships will provide the vital lifeline of supply and support to other canadian navy ships as well as to army and air force assets in certain deployed operations
1266143 a key component of the canadian forces transformation the ships will help build a truly joint navy army and air force capability
1266144 i feel that csor is probably the closest thing to the original force since the war they function very similar to the way we used to function
1266145 on that flag we will put any battle honours we get and well also perpetuate the honours of the first special service force
1266146 were hoping to have a small colour party of the vets march on to our change of command parade and hand their first special service force flag over to us as a symbol of us carrying on their legacy
1266147 but jtf2 is not a regiment so they couldnt accept our battle honours
1266148 then along came csor and csor is a regiment and very similar to the special service force
1266149 committed to getting the right equipment for the canadian forces at the right price for canadians with the right benefits for canadian industry
1266150 as the procurement process has not been completed yet it would be inappropriate to comment further

1266153 a key component of the canadian forces transformation the ships will help build a truly joint navy army and air force capability
1266154 this will not delay the project or our anticipated date for the awarding of the contract in july 2008
1266155 in this instance it was a tight budget compounded with commercial conditions which just increased the industrial risk to unacceptable levels
1266156 its kind of a trend when it comes to issues of canada u s relations and contentious issues like military integration we see that this government is reluctant to disclose information to canadians that is readily available on american and mexican websites
1266157 are we going to see u s troops on our soil for minor potential threats to a pipeline or a road
1266158 we dont know the answers because the government doesnt want to even announce the plan
1266159 but theres no agreement to allow troops to come in
1266160 it facilitates planning and co ordination between the two militaries the allow piece is entirely up to the two governments
1266161 the next time your town has a national emergency dont be surprised if canadian soldiers respond and remember canadian military arent bound by posse comitatus
1266162 unity of effort during bilateral support for civil support operations such as floods forest fires hurricanes earthquakes and effects of a terrorist attack in order to save lives prevent human suffering and mitigate damage to property is of the highest importance and we need to be able to have forces that are flexible and adaptive to support rapid decision making in a collaborative environment
1266163 an important symbol of the already strong working relationship between canada command and u s northern command
1266164 the army is now stretched almost to the breaking point and something is going to have to give if we are to be sustainable over the short and mid term
1266165 obviously all of it has to be replaced from existing stocks but the initial pool of stocked equipment has long since been used up either destroyed by the foe or is off being repaired
1266166 to create a stock of equipment we have to take it from the home based training systems which has an immediate and negative impact on training all of our equipment is either deployed being reset used in training or broken and waiting either labor or spare parts
1266167 continues to provide stable predictable funding with annual increases which will directly result in a stronger better equipped flexible canadian military
1266168 the army will be able to successfully conclude its personnel training and equipping requirements within the funding levels and equipment envelope provided to it by the government of canada
1266169 six month old strategic assessments misleads the canadian public into believing the cf is being inadequately funded this is simply not the case
1266170 the army continues to grow each year expanding by a total of 3 000 positions in the coming years to bolster existing formations and units

1266330 i go to bible study just like he does every week
1266331 for me not to be able to forgive him then id just be wasting my time going to bible study
1266332 where i get the courage and the grace to forgive i know it doesnt come from me it comes from god so i just give all the glory to god for how im handling the situation right now
1266333 i intend to mend the bridges i have burned and help rebuild a bridge if i need to all by myself but not do it in a spiteful way instead do it with the labor and the sound mind which god gives me
1266334 this issue that happened is going to be an opportunity for the carolina panthers and myself as an individual to show our true colors and be able to show the impact we can have and not have this moment leave the legacy of who i am to my children who i am to my teammates who i am as a man
1266335 i have shook his hand and looked him eye to eye today we have discussed some things we still have some more discussions some more things to talk about as far as what can we do to go out there and coexist on the same field the same team and be productive and help this team win this year
1266336 hes an ultra competitor and im a ultra competitor and we both hate losing
1266337 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball when you have those two types of individuals then something has to give

1266340 reprenant les th mes de la fluidit de la souplesse de la compr hension mais aussi de la fermet
1266341 cest peu de chose mais cest consid rable en terme de symbole et cela changera latmosph re des matches
1266342 nous voulons ensemble gagner la bataille des attitudes et des comportements en terme dimages et de jeu
1266343 joueurs et entra neurs ont une responsabilit thique et lun de leurs devoirs est de transmettre certaines valeurs nous avons galement la volont dam liorer la qualit de jeu car au haut niveau on est jug sur les r sultats mais aussi le spectacle propos nous sommes conscients du d ficit fran ais ce niveau
1266344 je suis ravi de cette initiative et tr s satisfait des changes qui ont eu lieu dans une ambiance conviviale nous avons pu voquer la nouvelle philosophie que lon veut insuffler tous ensemble dans notre football au niveau de larbitrage trois consignes ont t donn es laisser davantage vivre le jeu participer l laboration du jeu notamment en favorisant lavantage et enfin agir en partenariat ce dernier point est un l ment cl puisque nous avons demand nos arbitres de communiquer davantage et d tre encore plus ouverts
1266345 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1266346 these policies are forcing more uighurs to turn to more militant protest
1266347 proved to all the world that asians can run very fast
1266348 obviously theyve laid a lot of groundwork there from the start of things with j j hickson
1266349 theres a tie there i think from coach lowe with shareef abdur rahim who lives there and knows a lot of those guys and now j j its become a nice little pipeline because thats a state thats been loaded with talent
1266350 i saw their games on tv i saw the games he played
1266351 i guess ronnie or glen wesley could decide to come back and play someday but we havent had that situation we would not be in a position now to make that change
1266352 we just traded for brett favre hell be here at 1 30
1266353 i think you just lay it out to aaron rodgers if you really want favre back in camp and give him a chance to compete then give him a chance to compete i dont have a problem with that ultimately i think ones going to want to be traded if hes not going to play
1266354 its like quitting smoking hes been smoking green and gold for 17 years
1266355 the thing with packers gm ted thompson hes a guy that wants to win with his players he doesnt care if hes throwing out a legend brett favre was not one of his players aaron rodgers was his first draft pick he has pretty much gotten rid of anybody who wasnt one of his guys to me he doesnt have this plush office in this beautiful refurbished stadium if its not for brett favre so thats where im still on favres side
1266356 for a lot of people is your life the game or do you have other things that can occupy that space in your life and how do you see yourself do you see yourself as brett favre a person or brett favre a quarterback if you really see yourself as a quarterback you lose a lot of identity if you just step away from it
1266357 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1266358 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1266359 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1266360 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1266361 there are times when i want to hit somebody but i control myself
1266362 id be less of a man if i didnt forgive him
1266363 a god fearing man no matter what people may think and or may say
1266364 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1266365 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1266366 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1266367 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1266368 i havent seen it since i played it in 04
1266369 its just an incredibly tough golf course from what i remember it requires all the shots youve got to move the ball left to right right to left you need to hit it long you need to hit it straight you need to putt well these are just some of the most difficult greens ive ever seen so it takes absolutely everything
1266370 we just lost our first match and the first question mark rolfing of nbc sports asked me was how can you explain not making any birdies
1266371 i felt like i would after a five set match when it was 3 all in the first set im not quite in playing shape right now
1266372 thad has a great sense of timing throwing the ball into seams cutcliffe observed
1266373 he has a great sense of timing about where to put the ball in anticipation most disappointing thing was the inconsistency in fundamentals and in accuracy there are three or four throws hes got to make better on a consistent basis to fit into our system
1266374 ive never worked this hard preparing making sure i know whats going on watching film asking questions he said though not begrudgingly
1266375 as important as we think football is at this time of the year it is minuscule in comparison to the health and faith of our student athletes our hearts and prayers go out to the pressey family not only now in their time of bereavement but also in the future
1266376 giving up baseball had to be probably the hardest decision ive ever made in my life
1266377 but i knew i was definitely going to have to be at full strength and be 100 percent with the football program to help the program get to where we want to be the acc championship and contending for a national championship
1266378 weve got some guys back there that have played in games and understand what it takes said first year defensive coordinator everett withers
1266379 now its just a matter of getting better in training camp this year and seeing if we can get better in games
1266380 i talked to my family i talked to my coaches but in the end i knew it needed to be my decision
1266381 and although it hurt my heart i knew it was time
1266382 this summer was probably the best summer ive had in my life as far as training
1266383 i knew i had to get faster to go against the best receivers in the acc and our nonconference opponents so being able to get the confidence that i can run with receivers like tar heels brandon tate brooks foster hakeem nicks that was key before i was lacking a little bit of being able to run with them now im confident that i can
1266384 he has a knack of just being around the football withers said
1266385 hes gotten a whole lot smarter hes got a whole lot more confidence nicks said
1266386 lets us know hes committed that were a team that we want the same thing that we have the same goal
1266387 i had a chance to go out there to omaha but it was just too hard burney said
1266388 i love the boys and everything but for me to go back out there would have broken me back down and i had to build myself up for football but i love them boys i love the coaches over there and i loved the time i had with them
1266389 she made her choice and that was up to her
1266390 were here to represent our country we have a nice rivalry with russia with or without her its always been a battle whether shes here or not well always bring our best
1266391 its not an issue anymore were playing against russia now and its 12 people
1266392 anyone who puts that uniform on is our opposition there is no individual that we look at or highlight
1266393 once the ball went up it was just another basketball game
1266394 we did a good job of putting 40 minutes together
1266395 we took a step closer to what we are trying to accomplish
1266396 we expect it to be a great game and look forward to it
1266397 they are the no 1 ranked team in the world they have tremendous players on there basketball is a game where anything can happen you want to meet the u s as late as possible
1266398 i have been playing against those players for 10 years i think when the ball goes up its just going to be another basketball game

1266411 we dont need much motivation because we know who were playing for
1266412 but on another level its unfortunate that baseball is coming out of the olympics and we need to put a good tournament together and show that it is an important game
1266413 a lot of times were painted with the brush that were popular in the americas which we know we are and that were popular in asia which we know we are
1266414 but maybe in europe and other parts of the world baseball isnt as popular
1266415 its a changing landscape but at the end of the day baseball has to put on a good show
1266416 we have to have clean games and we have to continue to show the ioc that when we look at our agenda of 28 sports in the 2016 games is this a plus or a negative in the evaluation we have to be a plus sport
1266417 not bad for a team that was supposed to finish in last
1266418 weve got a chance to make a statement weve got a chance to take the lead in the division weve got a chance to fall back in the division a lot of things can happen
1266419 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1266420 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
1266421 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
1266422 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
1266423 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
1266424 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
1266425 hes been dealing with this shoulder problem for a long time
1266426 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100 percent
1266427 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days

1266490 were stopping short of going to a four day work week
1266491 for many of them education is a luxury because of the funding
1266492 were just trying to make it more convenient for students to be able to do that
1266493 this was my first mission trip with my youth group and i didnt know what to expect i was hoping that it wouldnt be too difficult and i would learn a lot from it what i experienced this week is something i cant experience anywhere else the biggest thing i got out of this was the lifestyle of the man we helped his name was carl and he has lived a rough life he is a very strong person to be able to still walk i personally talked to him a lot and learned so much he shared things with me he loved but had to let go of due to his heath issues he loved hands on work and since he can no longer use one of his arms it made it hard for him to watch us do all this amazing construction im so glad i got to be a part of carls life and i hope i can help many more people and give them hope
1266494 the first day at teameffort we met joe our team leader he is so awesome he took us to carls trailer and basically told us we had to build a deck and a shed with no instructions at carls trailer we were told to take down a previously made deck by an earlier mission group that wasnt up to standards joe gave us crowbars and hammers and told us to take the deck apart eventually we figured out how to accomplish the task using team work
1266495 at the teameffort retreat site we had nightly worship where we would play games sing songs and become closer to god i felt the same connection with god on the worksite as i did in the nightly service even though we werent in a church i sensed gods presence with the group so overall i think i learned that god will meet you anywhere and everywhere
1266496 when the deck was completely finished and carl was sitting on his new deck he made the comment that he thought there werent anymore good people left in this world especially young people
1266497 in tennessee i helped build a deck for carl the group before us had already built the deck and had dug the post holes and put them in the ground unfortunately though the posts were unstable and uneven so we had to take out the posts re dig the post holes put the posts in perfect lines and put cement around them so that they would be sturdy in this process carl watched us from his door he kept watching and waiting for his very own perfect deck to be built when we had only two board left to add to the decking carl opened his door and said he thought he could make it across the gap so we put a chair up on his almost complete deck and he stepped onto it the smile on his face was something ill never forget as we added the last two boards we looked over at carl and saw his humble delight carl was so grateful and he made all of us feel so happy for a man who was used to helping others most of his life he now could be helped by others
1266498 this mission trip was a very eye opening experience the most eye opening part of this mission trip was when we first arrived to our work site there stood a very poorly half built deck we realized that there would be no way to build on it and we would have to totally rebuild it as we took apart the deck re dug the holes and rebuilt it our group had revelation we realized we could have good intentions but if we were careless and cut corner it could end up with poor results having to take apart someone elses hard work made us really appreciate the hard intentional work and care that we put into rebuilding the deck this goal of building it right brought our group closer together and helped us to realize our potential each person gave it their best and offered their god given gifts to help complete a sturdy 8 x 10 deck
1266499 it was hot at our building site on the second and third day i prayed for some clouds to cover up the sun in our opening prayer i asked at least a little while god to make our work cooler by providing clouds us soon after we began our work i noticed that our morning blue sky was covering up with thin clouds everyone was amazed including me i also enjoyed listening to mr carl he told me that he had been an auto mechanic and had lived in sevierville for over 25 years i really enjoyed getting to know mr carl and building the shed for him
1266500 when we arrived on the work site at mr carls house the deck was half built but done poorly we had to take it apart and restart at first i dug holes to earn my phd or post hole digger and the second day we set the posts in concrete by the third day we finished the deck part when we had two more boards to put on the top of the deck carl said i think i can make it he really wanted to walk on a sturdy deck i could see that he really appreciated his new deck next week a handicap wheelchair ramp is to be built for his electric wheel chair
1266501 this past week we had an amazing opportunity to help out mr carl i was part of the shed crew as we talked to mr carl we learned how much this shed will mean to him he used to own an auto repair shop before he was sick when mr carl became ill he lost everything he owned except his trailer he told us that he always hoped he would have another shop and that is what we helped give him in the time i had to talk to him he let me know how thankful he was this past week was so amazing
1266502 during our work days at team effort i really saw god with us we had to build a deck the first team that was there before us did a bad job and we had to fix it the person that we built the deck for was carl it took us three days to build it and when it was finished carl walked out and sat down on the porch for about an hour one his face was an ear to ear smile i saw god in carl and i was so glad to see this man that didnt have any hope and was amazed to see how there still are good people left in the world
1266503 my experience this week was great i saw many cool people who had smiles on their faces because they knew they were here to help out people who needed to see gods love it was really fun building a shed for mr carl he was so happy when we finished the foundation and floor joe our leader was cool too later we spent time with our group tubing and white water rafting this trip was an all around fun trip
1266504 while we were in tennessee we had daily worship services teameffort leaders would speak each night about a personal experience and reflect on the story of the woman at the well on the fourth night a leader named tyler spoke throughout his talk certain things caught my attention one was a metaphor comparing a salt shaker to a church and how a church should reach out and affect others by showing gods love the salt shaker itself is the church and the salt inside is the people involved with the church just like salt in a shaker it doesnt do any good to keep it in the container also just as salt enhances a foods flavor christians should flavor the world with gods unconditional love and acceptance this comparison made me understand the reason of our trip
1266505 its an assault on the integrity of this entire process
1266506 ms mccormick handled this outrageous situation in the best possible way
1266507 im sorry these people have chosen to put you in this position
1266508 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1266509 it is very difficult to predict how the current market will play out and the full extent of its impact on the economy
1266510 in the meantime it will continue to be difficult for all of us in our industry
1266511 hong kong clearly remains an attractive market and an important growth engine for us in the region
1266512 we have a very strong position and i believe we can take better advantage of it this is a key priority for us
1266513 i honestly don t feel like it s anything i haven t seen some version of in a movie before when i watch the movie i m honestly shocked that of all the movies i ve been a part of this is the one that got an nc 17
1266514 i mean we sell weed to 10 year olds in this one and no one gives a shit all this movie zack and miri has to do is with sex and shit to me it s completely hypocritical that this would get an nc 17 rating
1266515 if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because there s a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures

1266518 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
1266519 the sentiment is more bearish now than before as concern over slower us economic growth is impeaching demand
1266520 we do expect oil prices to trend lower in the longer term
1266521 apesar de um aumento de 266 milh es de euros nas despesas petrol feras
1266522 the main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened especially in the u s
1266523 sometimes the focus of the market can shift and at this point it s focused on some of the areas of weakness in demand
1266524 but some of the issues that caused oil prices to lift have not yet been resolved

1266534 there was something tucked away in my heart for a very long time in this part of the world as many of you will know i adored my grandmother and one of the most frustrating things about today is that i cannot ring her up and tell her about it

1266540 so ist denkbar dass die meisten zwar keine lauten gespr che im flugzeug wollen sich aber von sms in der praxis nicht gest rt f hlen wenn die handys leise geschaltet sind

1266542 he just confirmed that it was not intended for anybody
1266543 it was something that would be used for his own purposes
1266544 you just think about your own kids and where they are and how quickly it can all be over
1266545 its such a shame to see someone so young die like that its a huge waste of life
1266546 i guess when it happens near where you live or near the people you love it feels more real
1266547 everything goes up and especially with respect to labor and materials
1266548 weve got projects that are laid out and will be staggering along the way
1266549 you look at current construction trends and they take a turn from where typical construction plans are
1266550 that neighborhood was probably the largest turnout ive ever seen
1266551 when i came out the officers came up to me and asked me if i was all right
1266552 i said yep bye and started to leave then they asked me whats my name and before i could get my computer on a paramedic grabbed my arm and said i might bite
1266553 what bothers me is they didnt even try to understand me
1266554 they just kept saying i might bite and that really hurts me
1266555 to be very honest i really felt kind of like an animal
1266556 they said that they might have to take me to the hospital
1266557 they would not even let me come back to the office by myself
1266558 they held onto my wheelchair all the way there and that made me mad even more
1266559 i realize i look very disabled but i dont feel very disabled

1266566 there are going to be very real benefits for employees specifically decreased gas cost decreased commute time both because they only have to commute four days but also because theyll be commuting during off peak times so the commute could potentially be shorter each day and hopefully improved work life balance

1266571 there has been a resurgence in christian apologetics as a direct result of the challenges christianity has faced in the form of militant atheism in college classrooms on the internet and in tv documentaries and best selling books
1266572 the apologetics of the 1970s and 80s are useful if you are teaching in a church camp but its not that relevant to the claims the new atheists are making which are very different
1266573 the new atheists are really surfing the waves of 9 11 equating islamic radicalism with christianity these are not questions addressed by c s lewis or josh mcdowell
1266574 it wasnt too many years ago that scholars were writing off apologetics because we live in a postmodern world where young people are not supposed to be interested in things like the historical jesus
1266575 the biggest shock is that among people who communicated to me that they had found faith in christ through apologetics the single biggest group was 16 to 24 year olds

1266583 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1266584 on monday morning xinhua the state news agency reported what appeared to be the deadliest attack against chinese security forces in recent memory 16 policemen were killed and 16 others injured when attackers threw two grenades into a police station in the desert oasis town of kashgar in the far west after driving a truck into the station at 8 a m two men were arrested
1266585 yeah right there could be some free speech tibet advocates or even worse human rights groups protesting on the streets chinese people need to be protected from so much freedom
1266586 ive seen a few xxx rated movies that should be x rated xx at most
1266587 they have these statistics that they bring up where its like well 78 of parents find the ratings very useful and i always feel its like because theyre the only game in town compared to nothing at all they probably are useful look parents there could be a real real ratings board where if you were unhappy with it there could be real transparency real accountability if people wouldnt like that more
1266588 if we get a weak services number and a weaker than expected production and manufacturing figure that would be a nasty combination

1266603 there are no signs of the securitisation markets opening something major needs to happen to kick start the mortgage industry perhaps not back to the levels that we saw in 2005 to 2007 but perhaps back to a level that would support the economic growth of the country
1266604 people need to accept that there has been a correction of between 12 and 15 in prices depending on where you are

1266683 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1266684 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people

1266709 that was just unbelievable bob and i were really arguing im trying to make a little light of it but we thought wed made the wrong call i just cant thank my guys enough and everybody for hanging tough everybody at office depot weve had an unbelievable run with office depot ford motor company they make the best cars out there im proud to drive them this is good
1266710 my car was really loose there all day but there at the end we got the car pretty decent i cant complain it came to us finally and we got it to run it stayed with us all day im just really proud of all these guys they did a great job they stayed with it all day and all these home depot guys did a great job we havent had very many days like this one this year i ran out of fuel before we got to turn three there it was nice to make it to the end considering what our luck has been this year this is as good as a win at least i can leave a race feeling good for once
1266711 we pitted a lap later than the leaders did and thought we were going to be just fine and i was pushing hard to get to the twenty and just couldnt get there those guys were really strong all day had a real tough time getting by the sixty six and used up some more gas there all in all a great day for this lowes impala we did a great job on the track good solid performance
1266712 we had a good car we just got mired in traffic there at the beginning of the race and there at the end when it started raining we pitted and we had good pit strategy just proud of todd berrier crew chief and all my shell pennzoil chevrolet guys for everything that theyve done it was the same car that we raced at indy last week they turned it around and fixed half the body and brought it here big improvement for us we dont give up i can promise you that
1266713 when you can just come out and concentrate on a good handling race car that makes our job a lot easier when we dont have to worry about things falling off of it it was just a nice solid day a good points day the guys were racing in the points were right in front of us and behind us so its exciting weve got some good tracks coming up im just happy to be here and have a shot
1266714 it was kind of weird just track position with this car is everything we had a flat right there at the beginning i didnt qualify very good and that didnt help anything we have to work on our qualifying program still have to work on our big track program but you have to take these good finishes when you can obviously i hated to give up that late race position to harvick
1266715 im not sure how good carl edwards was at the end but our budweiser dodge charger was definitely a second or third place car carl had the best car today but we werent far off of him with a little more luck with the cautions we probably had the car to beat we still got a top 10 and had one of the best cars out there today theres still a lot of racing left but today was a good day for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team
1266716 that was an awesome car i hate it for these guys but i told them to be proud of what we did do dont be disappointed about what we didnt do we did some great things today i am proud i appreciate them letting me drive the car i just want to thank everybody at dei and this whole no 8 team for letting me drive their car that is what life is all about right there
1266717 thats probably the most confused i have been in a race car on what to ask for out of it we were so loose the whole time thank you to all of my guys just for fighting because i was complaining a lot but i didnt really know what to tell them it was really confusing and the car was way loose
1266718 we had a top 5 car unfortunately we had a tire violation on our last pit stop and had to serve a pass thru penalty the at amp t pit crew has had great stops all year so well learn from this and move on the at amp t team usa impala ss was loose all day but we learned a lot and leaving pocono with a 21st place finish isnt bad considering what happened

1266733 they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honour
1266734 it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me
1266735 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that

1266740 i really appreciate the work the medical guys have done and i cant wait to get back into it

1266754 with the limited number of departments that now have access to it were measuring to see how quickly they turn that fuel over
1266755 the reason we need that data is because this thing is not only an alternate fueling site for us but it is also our contingency fueling site
1266756 ill never forget that call from the sheriff asking me what can we do and i didnt have an answer for him
1266757 those departments located in appling didnt have to go to martinez to find fuel
1266758 we were able to service them here so they could get back out to helping people as quickly as possible
1266759 right now were running 6 to 8 cents per gallon cheaper thats because we buy unbranded fuel and get tax incentives
1266760 if you dont have a license you dont pull a permit you dont start a house
1266761 it is not just a good thing for the consumer the home buyer but for our industry particularly for reputable builders who want to raise the standards
1266762 if there are some bad apples this system is going to have a way of weeding them out
1266763 you get a bit better of a deal buying at the supermarket but that doesnt matter so much when im talking about my health
1266764 the past two years especially this movement has gotten big
1266765 i have kids who write to me thanking me for their vegetables how often does that happen
1266766 people have something thats usually seven to 10 days old by the time it reaches the market with community supported agriculture its hours maybe a day old at most
1266767 i started doing some research and discovered that i could boost my immune system by eating local fruits and vegetables
1266768 our body needs the local pollens to ward off things like allergies
1266769 the fresher they are the more nutritious they are food can lose its nutritional value especially if its been stored the wrong way
1266770 if theyre week old vegetables youre not getting the same benefits
1266771 im a 100 percent committed to consuming locally grown foods if i can get my hands on them
1266772 its worth it to pay for confidence in your food i just ate a nectarine it said grown in the u s but it never says where its grown i find it interesting that we just dont think its important where our food comes from anymore
1266773 its farm fresh without having to be at the farmers market first think in the morning
1266774 i never gave much thought to food growing up i ate the standard american diet
1266775 i made a total change in the way i ate
1266776 it was a close game already and then they hit a homer and it was kind of a shock
1266777 then we came up and i knew he was going to throw me a changeup so i stayed back on it and got ahold of it
1266778 offensively anytime you can hit with a runner at second instead of first it puts pressure on the other team to have to execute even more
1266779 i dont know how hell score it but in my book thats a base on balls
1266780 a double an error and a walk and the bases are full of braves bream carries the winning run two balls one strike what tension the runners lead a lot of room in right center if he hits one there we can dance in the streets the 2 1 swung line drive left field one run is in here comes bream heres the throw to the plate he is safe braves win braves win braves win braves win braves win they may have to hospitalize sid bream hes down at the bottom of a huge pile at the plate they help him to his feet frank cabrera got the game winner the atlanta braves are national league champions again this crowd has gone berserk
1266781 thats what we want as an organization for us to play in games that matter
1266782 it helps in developing winning ball players so even from the development standpoint thats our focus
1266783 its unfortunate but you just have to pick yourself up and keep going
1266784 weve played well over 100 games together and you get to know where the other guys going to be
1266785 my last game in san jose i wore fleece in the ninth inning
1266786 the aia and dwell magazine team up to spread the word about sustainability
1266787 we were especially intrigued with projects that executed beautiful design ideas and were inherently green by concept from small ideas for the kitchen to a way of life the winners embodied these principles

1266793 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1266794 iraqi prime minister nuri al maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia
1266795 while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1266796 our focus to date has been short haul destinations our plans are to build a global product offering and to launch the travelrepublic co uk brand in other european markets
1266797 from the soldier side well i had some really cool photos from iraq i was trying to upload to this post but the site seems to be having a hiccup or something and wont take the photos
1266798 our operations are first class and are continually subject to the scrutiny of australian and overseas regulators as well as our own internal audits
1266799 we have no issue with this latest review and casa says it has no evidence to suggest that safety standards at qantas have fallen we agree and are totally confident these checks will confirm the integrity of our engineering and maintenance operations and our commitment to safety
1266800 he always told me to put away the bat and start pitching
1266801 i played infield for a good part of my life
1266802 they made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it and think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1266803 i just didnt know what to do i was in terrible shock
1266804 and now id like to answer some questions if you have any
1266805 after seven and a half years if i cant figure out how to dodge them i shouldnt
1266806 if you dont have any questions i can tell you a lot of interesting stories
1266807 the strange death of republican america chronicles of a collapsing party
1266808 its our job as builders to find those green products that dont drive up the price of the home
1266809 with proper planning and a little experience building green even certified green can be done for about the same cost we are building certified green homes at the highest levels of certification for less than 1 cost increase
1266810 for an informative breakdown on how green buildings cost from 0 to 2 more than non green buildings check out
1266811 found moderate to strong increases in respiratory and allergic health effects among children in homes with higher concentrations of selected vocs
1266812 most builders have still not fully realized that we are entering a whole new era of building the builders that make the changes now will be the ones that prosper those that take the wait and see approach will ultimately be hurt
1266813 why should i use green products when the conventional products serve me just fine
1266814 ok so from this day forward i will sit and think of topics to share and without all the back and forth to post or not to just do it right
1266815 a feast of innovations and ideas an educational smorgasbord designed to widen your vision and stimulate your mind with the latest best practices in green building
1266816 dont let anyone look down on you because you are young but set an example for all the believers in speech in life in love in faith and in purity
1266817 your lives are echoing the masters word the news of your faith in god is out
1266818 the talent here tonight is unbelievable and the excitement on stage was infectious
1266819 i enjoy dancing but im not half as talented a dancer as these kids its great to see them receive such encouragement so early in their lives i hope they develop the god given gifts they have received in the form of their talent and pursue careers in the fields of their choice i wish them all the best

1266822 dreadfully guilty that guests hard earned money has been squandered on wrapits debts
1266823 i am so shocked i dont know what to say
1266824 theres about 3 000 worth of presents on our list bought for us by family and friends and we have received none of it
1266825 there was everything from vases to rugs to coffee makers it sounds prosaic but these are the sort of things we will spend the rest of our life using and would have provided memories of who was at our wedding now we will have to ask all of our guests to get their money back set up another list and go through it all again
1266826 i feel so sorry for the couples who are caught up in this
1266827 i am utterly disgusted with what has happened it is not what getting married is supposed to be like
1266828 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
1266829 the only thing that will change their minds is public pressure
1266830 we fully appreciate that the company moving into administration has caused great stress among wrapits customers and couples
1266831 however we are confident that hsbc has at all times acted appropriately given the circumstances and any suggestion that hsbc is responsible for wrapits problems is absolutely refuted
1266832 the deterioration in market conditions particularly the downturn in the housing market and the need to ensure an adequate regulatory capital position throughout the period of state aid and temporary public ownership have led to the need to strengthen the capital position of the company
1266833 lower net interest income reflecting the companys current funding mix higher loan loss impairment provisions and lower non interest income reflecting much lower levels of new business
1266834 unnecessary printing of emails multiple copies single sided printing and the sending of massive documents to the printer which are unlikely to be read are just some of the regular scenarios lived out by businesses every day
1266835 most offices will find they can reduce waste costs by around 20 through simple no or low cost actions measures such as double sided or multiple page printing and recycling instead of paying for disposal can really help
1266836 4 is an average but weve found some manufacturing companies can save as much as 10 of their turnover
1266837 the comparatively large increase is consistent with some people electing to contract out meal preparation activity in response to their reduced availability of time from increased employment combined with their expanded spending capacity from higher real income
1266838 fresh and natural products in recent years trends in supermarket sales have demonstrated that consumers are increasingly looking for products which support a healthy lifestyle as well as providing convenience

1266885 yes the world may not miss us but what they will miss is a good 50 year if not greater time lag in technology that we would have invented think about it if we didnt exist thered be no fridge to bung our food in no esky to replace the non existent fridge no penicillin to cure our ailments no lifesavers to pull us out of the water and most importantly no cold beer sunday bbq all this wont evolve until some smart pup from new zealand decides that there is more to life than sitting watching the sheep and that may take some time

1266908 la fase neoliberal del capitalismo se ha caracterizado por una profunda transformaci n de paradigmas tecnol gicos organizativos pol ticos y conceptuales con alcance planetario
1266909 el terrorismo de estado se impuso mediante una serie de dictaduras que ya para los a os 70 ocuparon casi todo el mapa regional mientras que en los 80 la doctrina de seguridad nacional fue remozada y optimizada para el nuevo per odo de las llamadas democracias de seguridad con el correlato de los conflictos de baja intensidad
1266910 si la doctrina de seguridad nacional fue un instrumento ideol gico militar apto para contrarrestar los movimientos de liberaci n nacional en los a os 60 70 hoy tras la larga noche de la dictadura del pensamiento nico neoliberal el imperio las oligarqu as vern culas y sus administradores cipayos han venido trabajando en la construcci n social del miedo y de los nuevos enemigos internos para imponer su modelo de dominaci n

1266942 he criticized the soviet union not as a westerner but as a russian with deep orthodox values
1266943 he was trying to find a third way for russia
1266944 for me he opened my eyes to a new side of life that i had never heard about
1266945 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
1266946 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1266947 the entire thorny path of his life will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1266948 he said there is a drug problem that stops everything nobody can trust
1266949 for example if we ask for a visa to take our fruit to europe that will be one of the issues
1266950 i dont want to make a comment on that you know you heard thats the way it was these are all political issues none of these issues are legal drugs these are accusations these are perceptions theres no proof for the last seven years
1266951 they say the russian president says to build a wall around afghanistan to stop drugs
1266952 you know the people who are sitting in that room had family members killed by the russians and they had wounds on their bodies from the russian times
1266953 they didnt take it well the elders the members of the provincial shura council they were very unhappy about this they didnt like the russian example
1266954 he mr karzai perceives that there are certain people he cannot crack down on and that it is better to tolerate a certain level of corruption than to take an aggressive stand and lose power
1266955 he has decided not to lose power trying to do things that might fail disastrously

1266959 he did mention to me problems and separation with his wife and that was about it
1266960 if there was any indication of him being able to do something like this i would have said something to someone long ago

1266969 having the fewest wants i am nearest to the gods
1266970 states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands
1266971 we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history
1266972 the browser of choice for most mac users apples safari has no phishing protection
1266973 mac users think that they dont need to worry about viruses and spyware
1266974 this is the one area where the mac doesnt have an advantage in security
1266975 significantly fewer mac users were using anti phishing technologies but they were pretty much identical to windows users about giving personal information
1266976 windows user are used to being paranoid about not clicking
1266977 mac users arent even though they say anti virus software who needs it
1266978 it could be because theres less of it out there or more people could be using security software or better software
1266979 still this survival is bound to go down as one of the greatest mountaineering tales in k2s history
1266980 they had to descend without any safety lines and in that descent we know that some climbers have slipped down and their whereabouts are unknown
1266981 to send an airplane that could make a circle around the mountain to see if they can locate anyone
1266982 moving river of ice broke loose like an iceberg breaking loose from a glacier
1266983 not only did it wipe away the fixed ropes but it brought the whole slope into icy dangerous conditions
1266984 jess has no problem showing tony her favourite pussycat dolls routine she will dance in front of her camera until she makes her man happy
1266985 jess does get paranoid making sure tony doesnt have any of his cowboys buddies peeking in on the show
1266986 aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi
1266987 i kinda feel sorry for them we should give those two a break
1266988 i think there have been enough boobs in the white house
1266989 weve had a woman we have a black man and an old stiff
1266990 people are always asking me in interviews what do you think of foreign affairs
1266991 they knew each other for it looks like quite a while
1266992 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable
1266993 and that may have something to do with the mechanism by which they develop cancer
1266994 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1266995 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1266996 when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1266997 im still beginning my own review of my agency with respect to what our relationship was with this family and what the nature of our services were
1266998 i need a chance to convene my people look at the electronic database at the agency and just have a sense of if weve had activity and to what extent
1266999 we received this information with profound sadness and well do what we can at our agency to be as transparent as possible with respect to our involvement and to see what we can learn from something like this
1267000 this is not our typical experience at native child so im basically asking for some patience let me absorb this and have a look at the situation and whatever its a terrible day for us
1267001 jesus loves the little children all the children of the world
1267002 red and yellow black and white they are precious in his sight
1267003 donna was an all right person i dont know what happened
1267004 donna really wanted a girl she loved katelynn or so she said and now she is gone
1267005 ten weeks off is kind of boring four weeks is enough to hang with your friends but not forget too many math equations
1267006 its the 21st century yet most schools still work on a 19th century calendar
1267007 weve had to put a cap on enrolment and we have 11 portables
1267008 to be honest a 10 week vacation is a very long time this way my daughter had just a few weeks between grade 3 and grade 4 which is long enough to feel like a holiday but not so long you forget what you learned
1267009 its also flexible for family holidays to have more opportunities to travel not just one week when every other family is doing the same thing
1267010 weve deferred moving forward in large part because of our budget considerations and we will reconsider it in a years time
1267011 the board hasnt really given it a lot of consideration because it would involve a lot of collective agreement issues and we would be talking closely with cupe and the teachers federation
1267012 from a practical standpoint many of our schools dont have any air conditioning and the schools in the summertime when its really hot can be unbearable
1267013 when we compare the number of crashes so far this year to the same time last year theres 80 more people alive
1267014 since the street racing legislation came in theres been a significant drop in speed related fatal crashes
1267015 its the highest speed ive ever seen or heard of
1267016 normally traffic heading in is pretty dead but theres been a steady back and forth from the city
1267017 and lots of day trippers because of the perfect weather theres lots of people on the roads
1267018 zhongguo zhongguo ha ha ha zhongguo zhongguo bisheng jia you jia you

1267020 the mayor of beijing wanted the chinese people to make a good impression on the world
1267021 it was believed necessary to instruct our fans in when to cheer and how to cheer when is the appropriate time to speak or to take pictures the campaign i think has been very successful
1267022 interactions are necessary for a basketball competition which can arouse players enthusiasm audience should be passionate but not manic and enthusiastic but not out of control
1267023 during a short distance track event as a referee gives an order of on your mark spectators must be in absolute silence so that athletes can focus during some long distance races like the marathon spectators should not cross the barrier to pass water towel etc to athletes
1267024 audience could be easily out of control when watching an exciting competition therefore during a football match audience must keep calm and treat victory or defeat correctly riot burning of sportswear besieging referees and players are strictly prohibited
1267025 china has 5 000 years of cultural history but a lot of olympic events are western sports
1267026 our people didnt know the rules so they had to be taught
1267027 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village
1267028 we are well prepared to deal with any kinds of threats
1267029 we have heard concerns expressed about the original union airport rail link proposal and the province is currently in discussions with snc lavalin to find ways that the airport rail proposal can be changed to address a number of these concerns
1267030 it appears to be heading toward a non stop train between pearson and union station
1267031 i suspect thats what were going to be faced with
1267032 both mayor miller and premier mcguinty have stated that toronto needs what most of the worlds biggest cities have which is a rail connection between the airport and downtown
1267033 if theyre going to do it then make it into real public transit make it into something that serves the people of toronto not just the business travellers
1267034 were giving a private company our money to run a train that most of us will never see
1267035 as a police officer its a very brazen attack and it is scary whether or not they knew he was a police officer to open fire is very brazen regardless of who they were targeting
1267036 theyre working their way through some search warrants and trying to come up with the actual shooter

1267048 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1267049 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1267050 the first comprehensive report on kids meals at popular fast food and chain restaurants finds the servings are far too high in calories for a single meal

1267067 der kirche treu zu sein im schritt mit der kirche zu marschieren nicht hinter oder vor ihr
1267068 reichtum und der vielfalt mit welcher der heilige geist die kirche christi versch nern
1267069 liebe f hrt uns alle dazu anzunehmen was jeder empfangen hat so da wir zusammen die sendung erf llen k nnen das evangelium allen v lkern und allen nationen zu verk ndigen
1267070 ich glaube nicht da ich besser als der kardinal erkl ren k nnte was unsere liebe f r die kirche und unser gehorsam den bisch fen und hirten gegen ber sein soll
1267071 als eine bewegung bem hen wir uns mit den pastoralpl nen der di zesen und pfarreien zusammenzuarbeiten
1267072 das treffen hat mir sehr geholfen wir haben nat rlich immer punkte an denen wir zu arbeiten haben
1267073 i remember clearly walking my dog up yarm road in darlington and seeing the works through cummins glass facade
1267074 that high intensity dayin day out industry of the north east really made its mark on me and has influenced my work tremendously
1267075 i would love the opportunity to make a major landmark piece of sculpture in my own back yard the north east
1267076 the region has really developed as a fantastic place to see contemporary public art
1267077 any counterfeit notes being passed will only form a tiny percentage of genuine currency in circulation
1267078 but if anyone has suspicions about a note they have been handed then they should ring the police
1267079 he was a right character who had many friends he liked to have a good old natter but he could be a stubborn old man and would stick to his guns
1267080 he was one of the last to learn the time honoured tradition of barring drilling blasting and filling at the ironstone face
1267081 it was a complicated job that you had to spend two years training for and as miff was always keen to point out there were no power tools in eston due to the dangerous high seams
1267082 it was sad to hear this news it is interesting to note that the last man to be killed in the pit was a brighton and the last miner to survive was a brighton
1267083 miff was the last of the tribe and a total one off the first time i went to see him was in 1999 he was keen to talk and was soon out of his chair vigorously barring the roof of his living room as if still in the pit he was a laugh and full of mischief which i was told was the origin of his nickname
1267084 in the place of substantive reforms needed to police authorities powers and responsibilities we have tinkering with their membership
1267085 directly elected crime and policing representatives will not strengthen the link between those responsible for delivering policing and the public and will undermine partnership working
1267086 there are already people elected at local level to represent the community and be their advocates over a range of services councillors there is absolutely no rationale to setting up a parallel and potentially conflicting system
1267087 the public are the best weapon to help tackle crime that is why im putting them at the forefront of setting priorities
1267088 it saved my daughters life and other babies should have the same chance other families should have the opportunity to have their daughter saved or their son
1267089 he had made it out of metal and there were a few paint splodges on it but he had just invented it
1267090 after the letter i tried to arrange a meeting with them but they said it wasnt their procedure and that things had to be in writing
1267091 not being able to express myself i should have been in a position where i can actually go down and talk to people
1267092 had mr gillingham revealed at the outset that he was registered disabled with a bad back then like other tenants in the same position he wouldnt have been evicted
1267093 it was so calm when we set off that we had to row to keep ourselves moving
1267094 there were no signs up telling us not to go in the river on boats
1267095 i would never have let them in the river if i knew it was going to be that fast
1267096 i did some homework and spoke to a couple of people local to the area and they did not know there was rapids around that area
1267097 this should be a warning for any families at the start of the summer to be very careful and take precautions
1267098 when they got into the river it was calm there was hardly any rainfall that day
1267099 all the children were wearing lifejackets and it was not an inflatable dingy it was a ribbed seagoing craft with oars attached
1267100 the key stage two sats have become little more than vanity testing proof for the government of rising standards in primary schools which the consumers of these results secondary schools arent buying
1267101 its very demoralising for pupils to realise theyre not at the level they thought they were
1267102 the children themselves fare very badly from influenza but they are also the source of infection for many adults
1267103 there is an urgent need for the jcvi to review their decision
1267104 this vaccination would need to be given every year to be effective
1267105 we know that influenza affects the vulnerable the elderly and the young and we also know that flu causes a lot of problems in terms of health and also with the economy with people being off work and so on
1267106 another remarked sean connery s a loose cannon we cant control anything he says but he thinks hes speaking for us
1267107 the most welcomed most enduring piece of daily mass e mail in cyberspace
1267108 before the soldiers arrived life wasnt worth living we were living on chance just hoping and praying that we would see another day it was terrible
1267109 i saw death the youth who abducted us led us into a forest and hacked my relatives with machetes they said we were ungrateful thieves who had taken their land and left them squatters they vowed to finish us all
1267110 we had lost hope because we knew death could come at moment at any place
1267111 we were being killed like dogs and as if there was no government were glad that it is all over
1267112 they would come at any time of the day and pick us one by one and take us to chesakwa forest
1267113 sometimes they rounded up a whole family and took them up the mountain where they killed them few ever came back they later dumped their bodies in a river within the forest
1267114 the soldiers did not conduct any serious investigations before the operation they simply passed a blanket judgment on all the youth in the region they accused me of being a sldf fighter even after i showed them the grave of one of my family members killed by the militia
1267115 the people who were leading the identification process at kapkoto military base were locals who were well known to me
1267116 some people misused the opportunity to settle scores with neighbours over previous grudges i dont know how well ever live in peace with them again
1267117 the operation was meant to restore order not to kill people they should congratulate us for the exemplary work we have done instead and stop undermining our efforts
1267118 this was a group that was hell bent on causing pain and suffering if their was land at the settlement scheme why did they spread the conflict to other parts
1267119 well knowing that one mohammed ali alias abdallah mohammed fazul alias abdalla abdul karim alias harun fazul alias adan hussein ali mirza did on the november 20 2002 at kikambala murder 15 people received him in malindi in december 2007 maintained him and helped him to escape punishment
1267120 according to the procedural law once the accused person enters a plea and sufficient investigations are carried out by police it will be infringing on the rights of the accused persons to have them remain in custody
1267121 it appears as if this is a fishing expedition because the prosecution is not willing to prosecute the accused
1267122 they boldly enter and cut our trees up to five kilometres inside uganda graze their cattle and even mould their bricks here but when you dare to say anything they harass and beat you up on your own land
1267123 living in fear many feel they have no place to go
1267124 appeared to have just been told that the shelters would be closing down and that they should go find some other place to stay
1267125 all the shelters are still open including the rifle range shelter
1267126 we disagree that its appropriate to close the camps by then
1267127 a communication sent to one of the mecs tasked with reintegrating the displaced foreign nationals earlier this month has still received no response
1267128 few if any of the organisations working with the displaced foreign nationals have any idea about the reintegration strategy that government intends to embark on
1267129 my male friends think my job is awesome but my female friends are less sure
1267130 last year i was barely paid the minimum wage and ended up washing dishes most of the time but this summer i was finding it even harder to get work i looked for months before anything at all came up then i saw an advert on the internet for butlers2go working as a naked butler
1267131 but many of my friends havent managed to get a job at all and those that have are lumped with monotonous jobs with poor pay as a butler i do hen nights baby showers weddings there are some funny incidents the odd woman tries to pull up your apron or kids try to look up it but in general its a great job you have to be very extrovert and confident but its more interesting than some conventional jobs and my wages can be more than 50 a night so i use them towards the cost of living student loans dont go as far as the government seems to think
1267132 ive worked during every uni holiday so far in the cafe of a local hospital two years ago doing admin stuff for a trucking company last summer it was easy i registered with a temping agency and two days later i had a job
1267133 loads of my friends have been moaning about their lack of employment before employers would draft people in to cover holidays but now people seem unwilling to take temps on unless its absolutely necessary ive finally got work now doing data input at the co operative groups headquarters in manchester but its been really frustrating up till this holiday id done my best to avoid going into my overdraft but this summer i had to dip into it when i came home in june and by the time i found my job i was halfway through my funds
1267134 in the past ive found work easily doing admin bookkeeping and working as a receptionist i thought the same would happen this year but its been the opposite i came away from interviews with temping agencies who thought my cv was very positive but they still couldnt find me a job they said that theres minimal temping work available at the moment it can start to affect your confidence you begin to question your abilities and its also made my summer rather tight
1267135 its true that major banking legal and engineering firms keen to prime students for graduate positions increasingly run summer internships and work placements
1267136 but that doesnt mean employers will ignore a more wacky summer job it can show evidence of learning new skills and proving successful in the workplace some firms may also see a varied cv as signs of a potentially innovative and free thinking employee
1267137 my routine was really busy on the day of an event id get my hair and make up done then sort out all the other girls with their costumes hot pants bras pink feathered tops and neon stockings wed head to a beach parade to dance in the afternoon at midnight there was the main town parade to do then do freestyle podium dancing in the club doing sets until six in the morning then id have to make sure all the girls got home before hand washing all the costumes
1267138 in the end i ended up getting ripped off midway through the summer my pay was halved without warning i had to leave ibiza early it wasnt realistic so i had to come home but now im back in london im finding it hard to find another job
1267139 the boards action is against the interests of the nation and risks the safety of thousands of american traveling and living abroad

1267141 mr medellin raised that issue before the trial in pre trial he didnt raise the issue and he didnt raise the issue during the trial

1267149 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
1267150 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
1267151 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
1267152 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
1267153 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
1267154 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
1267155 secular worldview is uncritically accepted as being entirely unbiased and neutral in its approach
1267156 this argument about projection cuts both ways after all isnt it equally possible to say that freud and other atheists deny the existence of god out of a need to escape from a father figure dismissing god as a psychological projection while claiming neutrality in our own psyche is disingenuous at best
1267157 notice the arrogance of the assumption you as a christian are biased by the circumstanes of your life but i as a sceptic am completely neutral in my thinking
1267158 this is a wonderful place i will come back and visit it often
1267159 that is a horrible place and i will never go back there again

1267161 if you noticed all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up leaving behind the simple and cheap ones while it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves that is the source of your problems and stress be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee in most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink what all of you really wanted was coffee not the cup but you consciously went for the best cups then you began eyeing each others cups now consider this life is the coffee the jobs money and position in society are the cups they are just tools to hold and contain life and the type of cup we have does not define nor change the quality of life we live sometimes by concentrating on the cup we fail to enjoy the coffee god has provided us enjoy your coffee
1267162 its hard it gets easy it gets fun again whats hard to sustain is some ideal that its perfect thats ridiculous whats fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person and looking across the room and saying im still here and i still love you you re meet reconnect you have marriages within marriages within marriages thats what i love about marriage thats what i want in marriage its unfortunate but we live in a very disposable society those moments where it looks like uh oh this isnt working those are the most important transformative moments most couples draw up divorce papers when theyre missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection

1267170 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1267171 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1267172 this is because cuil isnt set up as a massively parallel search network the way say google is each of cuils search appliances is specialized to a particular subcategory of results there are machines that understand and index sports others are experts on medicine etc as these search machines get overloaded sollitto said they drop offline for some queries and the machines left online return less than relevant results that then appear at the top of users pages

1267201 i give her most of the credit for the positive influence around my daughter
1267202 he was on the phone to rosetta on and off for two hours crying and constantly calling and she finally agreed to let him back in the house

1267211 the first is a deletion of the expression west armenia from its declaration of independence and a signature of an agreement on good neighborliness and the inviolability of borders
1267212 second is progress in the nagorno karabakh case and third is dropping charges of genocide against turkey
1267213 i do not expect great things from an eventual meeting but it is evident that there will be a thaw in bilateral relations
1267214 i believe that turkey is an important player in the caucasus balkans and the middle east as turkey has more influence armenia is more and more isolated
1267215 moreover as turkeys negotiation process with the european union advances economic and cultural relations will improve with armenia
1267216 even if the president is willing for progress it will be negotiated behind the scenes and made public at the last minute
1267217 this is propaganda by armenian because it is turkey that brings conditions
1267218 the implementation and enforcement statutory audit directive is particularly important at a time when financial markets face a difficult period and need to rely on robust audits of financial statements i feel encouraged that the public oversight bodies in europe are working together so that third country audit firms have a clear idea what it is expected from them when they audit companies listed on european capital markets
1267219 there are 13 television channels broadcasting in kurdish all around the world even iran has four channels broadcasting in kurdish
1267220 i just cannot announce a certain date on which the broadcasting in kurdish will start but our colleagues have been working hard we have set up an auction for two tv studios
1267221 but if i had the staff today than i would start broadcasting tomorrow
1267222 we are not looking for staff with perfect kurdish this is not a must if our kurdish citizens can understand the broadcasts then that would suffice
1267223 we need staff that are sensitive about the national integrity of this country the new channel will begin and end every day by broadcasting the turkish national anthem
1267224 but do not worry we wont broadcast programs that teach kids how to perform nighttime prayers
1267225 the programs will help children to acquire a national identity
1267226 private channels have to survive on income they gain from commercials but trt is a player on a different track we do not need to measure swords with private channels since that means descending to their level on the contrary trt should ascend to the top league of the worlds state broadcasters such as bbc rai zdf and ard
1267227 we have been renewing everything in trt other than its logo
1267228 i came from work saturday and there was no way i could brave entering the house
1267229 our building is new it is only four years old and it shouldnt be collapsing
1267230 municipal workers and gendarmerie warned me friday evening telling me to shut down the premises
1267231 our own equipment was inadequate and right now the municipal president is at the greater metropolitan city hall to acquire a team that can demolish the building
1267232 we will not let them demolish the building without a court order
1267233 our building is a solid durable building and we are completely innocent the blame rests with those who opened up its foundation and we expect the state to own up
1267234 the municipality has a right to demolish any building that poses a life threatening risk to its residents and while it is good to establish a legal precedent in this case we do not have to wait for a court decision
1267235 when excavation began next door we warned them that the building would collapse but they said they had taken precautions
1267236 when the building began leaning 10 to 15 days ago they told us that the building was just settling and on saturday night it was leaning over as far as it does right now
1267237 a building doesnt start collapsing for no reason this happened overnight with a burst sewage pipe flooding the seven meters of excavation and softening the earth underneath the building
1267238 we really need some help right now we are in dire straits
1267239 this does not mean we are not prepared to be as strong as it takes to get a successful resolution he wrote in an email to members
1267240 the spl are not taking us seriously and are in for a real shock which im sure setanta with their big bucks will not be happy about one told the daily record be prepared unless the spl have a major rethink of fees saturdays fixtures are in doubt
1267241 a series of discussions have taken place and we expect the matter to be resolved soon
1267242 these results mean that the tevatron experiments are very much in the game for finding the higgs
1267243 less than 30 percent of newborn babies who are born under 1 000 grams can live as the number of premature births increases the number of deaths similarly shows a rise the deaths arent related with infections
1267244 the number of patients coming to the hospital increased in july and we work over capacity by 120 and 140 percent during the summer period
1267245 it seems that the hospital didnt do so as it doesnt assume that the deaths are caused by infections
1267246 it is necessary to make an in depth investigation to understand whether the deaths were related to infections
1267247 why dont other hospitals admit patients under risk while zekai tahir burak does the hospital says they have to bed two newborn babies in a single incubator we came to the conclusion that the hospital has a lack of capacity and isnt well equipped to meet the needs of excess demand negligence played a role in the deaths
1267248 patients are transferred to our hospital from the central anatolian hospitals while doctors there were on leave even if we tried to direct them to another hospital they insist on staying here
1267249 we even expanded the newborn unit but the burden is on state hospitals university hospitals should share our burden
1267250 the number of patients increases although it should have indicated a decrease under these circumstances
1267251 it will be a first ever holiday that a syrian president and his family spend outside syria
1267252 i consider arguments including little details such as format and location of the visit inappropriate in such an important period and before an important visit
1267253 i think we should focus on the core of the visit
1267254 what i request from you reporters is not to pay attention to the form but the substance of this important visit
1267255 a country trusted by both iran and the p5 1
1267256 therefore i recommend to our media to cope with the visit in a way not to overshadow turkeys serious and dignified position
1267257 the regions democratic structure and the events which has taken place in the last five to 10 years must be taken into account during discussing a settlement in the region
1267258 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
1267259 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
1267260 being a part of an organization that brings together people of different countries and cultures is a matter of great pride for me i am very happy in turkeys name and in the name of my country i am proud of representing turkey here
1267261 what we have done in turkey is basically recognized in the international field
1267262 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
1267263 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
1267264 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
1267265 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
1267266 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
1267267 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
1267268 the whole literature suffers from this basic problem of acting as if montys choice means nothing
1267269 hey shes talking about pushing like when you give birth
1267270 ah i see i do not bear the tomes all acolytes must bear the weight of the tomes on their pilgrimage very well then
1267271 you will surrender the scepter to me wench i must cross the black path i must bring chaos to the acolytes
1267272 obviously i wanted to ask him what do you think of the young guy
1267273 and he brought up some good points about his evaluation of practice
1267274 hes got a lot of talent and a lot going through his mind if they just keep it simple he seems to have a real good feel for it i think hes going to do good things
1267275 you can tell from offseason training until now hes getting comfortable with the offense
1267276 jamarcus has this presence when he comes in there its something that you cant teach a swagger its exciting to watch him you can just tell
1267277 i remember coming off the field and our head coach lou saban saying son youre going to get a helluva education tonight and theres not a damn thing i can do about it now
1267278 that was the last transmission we received from captain startrousers
1267279 commander sparklefro do we know where captain startrousers and his hustling starship troopers are currently stranded
1267280 no maam captain startrousers and his hustling starship troopers were assigned to quell the folk rock rebellion on the planet falsetto x according to our records they never arrived
1267281 grand funk admiral roseybottom would like to inspect those records commander
1267282 these are all the records we were able to salvage from captain startrousers ship before we lost contact
1267283 commander the admirals of star command have decided to mount a full search and rescue op
1267284 of course captain startrousers and his hustling starship troopers are the face of star command we cant afford to lose them ill draw up the orders at once
1267285 for chics sake bring extra glitter if startrousers is in real trouble hell need all the sparkles he can get
1267286 this one is foolproof and its not like anyone else has any ideas
1267287 okay heres what we need to do first well need several thick soft straw mattresses and well need to modify the trebuchet to fire them
1267288 this is the lower part of the wall i think if we reinforce the trebuchet enough we can give it enough torque to fire over this point
1267289 and then we fire some mattresses over the wall and then what how does that help us
1267290 we strap him in between two of the mattresses and fire him over the wall the mattresses will cushion his landing and once hes on the other side he can start looking for a way through from that side if we have teams on both sides of the wall we double our chances of success
1267291 cette s rie craint je me force la regarder chaque semaine en esp rant quelle me divertira peut tre cette fois ci
1267292 theres a little bit of that let me show you but its balanced by the fact those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
1267293 anybody whos gone through that been beaten up a little bit theres going to be a confidence factor
1267294 not playing last year was probably one of the hardest things i ever had to go through period
1267295 while last year sucked and going through that was tough i dont feel like they were unfair to me if i look at it like an adult they gave me a fair shake
1267296 to be honest with you i wanted a fresh start somewhere else
1267297 i wanted to get out of this market and start all over
1267298 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging
1267299 you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of look at yourself in the mirror
1267300 in terms of going out there and feeling like i can get the job done i feel i can do that
1267301 we have decided in our infinite generosity to give you pathetic humans a sporting chance we propose an aeroplane fight the winner takes the earth the loser is destroyed
1267302 we will use your technology a cursory search of wikipedia your global database has turned up the designations of your most advanced aircraft we demand five of your highly advanced f 106 delta dart interceptors for our pilots
1267303 that is why its designation is f 106 and not for example f 35 which is totally much older
1267304 of course it is pitiful humans of course it is we shall use this f 106 to crush you in our aeroplane fight and then the earth will be ours
1267305 no ryan though i suppose technically this is what comes after your life
1267306 what do you mean i crashed into a semi live hard die young all that
1267307 yes the very picture of the byronic hero im sure and yet
1267308 and yet the semi swerved in an attempt to spare your sad sad little life oh certainly you plowed into the drivers side door and perished and yet so did the driver and without a driver the semi truck continued into pedestrian traffic killing three people including a young girl who would otherwise have gone on to do great things an accomplished surgeon who saved the lives of many and would have gone on to save the lives of many more and a homeless man who invented the clapper
1267309 what what does that have to do with me what is this
1267310 ryan you will now experience every single death you have ever caused through action or inaction beginning with the four you killed today
1267311 if an urban family of four makes less than four millions rials 425 a month then the family is under poverty line
1267312 first of all i bought a house here we started coming to turkey with my wife and children at least four times a year i explored and photographed the areas i would like to introduce to the world and then set up the web site www antakya tv five months ago the web site describing beauties of antakya in turkish german and english will be also available in arabic soon
1267313 it is a big loss that not enough introduction has been done so far despite all the citys characteristics such as the worlds second biggest mosaic museum or the first cave church in order to overcome this absence i will publish an introductory book besides the web site my aim is to draw everyones attention
1267314 were in a peculiar situation where a year from now were likely to look back and say that monetary policy makers have made a very very serious error
1267315 the problem is we dont know whether were going to say they were too loose or too tight
1267316 it has to balance the lingering risk of a wage price spiral with prospective disinflationary pressures emanating from the downturn
1267317 theres a kind of stagflation marching over the world economy
1267318 i hope policy makers are able to figure it out and make the right decisions to fight it
1267319 it must be hurting you youre just not saying anything
1267320 you can stop any time it just means youll lose
1267321 nothings keeping you from putting your arms down the contest was your idea
1267322 im getting these because im on a diet and theyre really low calorie but i wouldnt recommend them to other people theyre awfully expensive for the amount of food and theyre a little bland i just like them anyway
1267323 ah get on with you why are you on a diet girlfriend you look great
1267324 oh my boyfriends trying to lose a bunch of weight so im just watching my calories as a way to support him i wouldnt mind if i lost five pounds but mostly it helps him to have company
1267325 i think you use the word gross a little differently than i do and this other guy said
1267326 im going to leave these here were tired of looking at them
1267327 i guess ill fall on my sword and get fat
1267328 i dont know i think some people from around the floor found out about it
1267329 i know how you can get a cupcake you can take three dollars and walk over to crumbs
1267330 i dont understand how all these chocolates can just sit here uneaten
1267331 i know its common in social science lit but its a little known fact that the baby jesus cries every time you use
1267332 you noticed a lot of things that irritated me early on when this was just as thesis e
1267333 i liked this sentence in ss thesis suicide is often preceded by life events i thought hm yes there are those rare neonatal suicides who pop out of the womb and think goodbye cruel world

1267338 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1267339 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
1267340 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
1267341 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
1267342 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
1267343 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1267344 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
1267345 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
1267346 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
1267347 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
1267348 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
1267349 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
1267350 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
1267351 i cant i cant see the ceiling is it a hologram or something
1267352 or something good sir you cant see the ceiling because the ceiling is in the thermosphere
1267353 thats impossible how could you even thats at least a hundred kilometers up
1267354 its more than that its three hundred kilometers up the outer lights of our dome make aurora borealis look like acrophobic old ladies
1267355 ladies and gentlemen this is the largest man made structure that has ever been built we have our own atmosphere our own ecosystem even our own laws and currency and its all geared towards one thing your pleasure
1267356 i see youve noticed that our carpet isnt a carpet
1267357 in fact its grass and beneath that earth bedrock mantle core the whole nine yards but dont worry about insects or mud the insects are specially engineered to avoid all human contact their presence is unfortunately necessary to our ecosystem as for mud well that would require rain underground irrigation takes care of the water needs of all our plant life
1267358 in arkansas we had four or five pass protections the whole time i was there
1267359 i come out here you have 10 or 12 if youre a split second late youre going to miss him
1267360 i was just asking gore not to punch me in the face you know how it is we dont fight anymore we sue
1267361 thats how we want him to be at every practice not just because were going to play somebody else
1267362 im not into the whole well when the lights go on they play well thats not my deal
1267363 the most important markets for tesco at present are the united states where we opened last year in california and arizona china whose economy will reach the same volume than that of the united states in the year 2020 and turkey which has a young and dynamic growing population
1267364 the recent explosion in the number of shopping centers in turkey is an opportunity for us because it makes opening stores more feasible last year our sales volume in turkey increased by 50 percent
1267365 we are in the construction phase in two more projects and have reached agreements on two other new locations
1267366 this new store means 350 new jobs in addition to job creation we are also keen to promote career development for example store managers in our alanya and konya stores started as cashiers we have also launched a graduate program with a management studies department in zmir which means students taking part in the program and doing a traineeship at tesco kipa may be guaranteed a job after graduation
1267367 one of the most important aspects of tesco kipa is the sections for fresh fish meat and bread in terms of fresh food we could say we are the most advanced in turkey
1267368 economic dynamics reveal that we shouldnt be pessimistic about the future we have high expectations concerning the forthcoming months
1267369 we will manage to overcome the obstacles that hinder the dynamism of the turkish nation if the disagreements on our political scene come to an end
1267370 i can say that those who purchased our houses pay approximately ytl 2 500 in annual installments there might be a higher potential however our citizens do not prefer to become indebted by huge sums of money
1267371 people opt to pay back their debts in a relatively shorter time span which would not surpass six to seven years
1267372 this situation could be deemed as the evaluation of the 3 000 housing credits in the last two years
1267373 first we need to take into account the needs of the real estate sector in order to make a thorough evaluation of the sector we cannot reach a correct analysis without clarifying the notion of needs hence we have to investigate both the amount of production in the sector and the purchasing power of the citizens
1267374 we are actually in need of 1 000 000 houses per year if we add this number to the houses that need to be constructed again
1267375 however the number of construction licenses issued during the best times of the sector merely amounts to 650 000 i believe that if we manage to construct houses with available credit and finance opportunities then the number of houses that our citizens are in need of might escalate to 1 million yet the annual interest rates should drop to 1 percent and the period of installments should increase to more than 20 years for the achievement of this target
1267376 according to ar eliks 2007 financial statement based on international financial reporting standards our companys turnover is ytl 6 6 billion for 2007
1267377 this is a book between two of the last remaining giants in the field
1267378 i hope the last theorem wont become the lost theorem
1267379 i started out by asking him for information on things in the book
1267380 and he e mailed me back and said i dont know i have no idea what i was thinking of when i wrote that it had just gone right out of his head
1267381 its sort of a worthy exclamation point on two pretty incredible careers
1267382 if we can somehow figure out what possible futures there might be
1267383 you can try to encourage the ones you like and avoid the ones you dont
1267384 fantasy is like eating an ice cream cone you dont have to think a bit
1267385 from now on we will primarily focus on expanding in the field of urban hotels
1267386 one of these hotels is located in taksim talimhane this will be turned into titanic city we had a hotel in this area however we demolished it for the construction of a totally new hotel
1267387 meanwhile our group continues the construction of another hotel near capacity shopping center in bak rk y this will be opened on dec 1 2009 and the name of the hotel will be titanic port
1267388 we own another three star hotel which has been operating for 15 years in i li
1267389 we will own four hotels in istanbul and one hotel in antalya by 2009
1267390 we served 1 500 people at the same time in our hotel last week the occupancy rates of the hotel particularly for september seem satisfying kartal is a district which has high potential for hotel investment as the centers of many holdings are located in this region
1267391 we have the only five star hotel on the asian side of the city other than mariott the groups in particular show an immense interest in our hotel
1267392 obviously i wanted to ask him what do you think of the young guy
1267393 and he brought up some good points about his evaluation of practice
1267394 hes got a lot of talent and a lot going through his mind if they just keep it simple he seems to have a real good feel for it i think hes going to do good things
1267395 you can tell from offseason training until now hes getting comfortable with the offense
1267396 jamarcus has this presence when he comes in there its something that you cant teach a swagger its exciting to watch him you can just tell
1267397 i remember coming off the field and our head coach lou saban saying son youre going to get a helluva education tonight and theres not a damn thing i can do about it now
1267398 i think youre going to be happy with this broccoli soup
1267399 you know on the second bite im not sure that this is something id want to finish
1267400 i was kind of perplexed i thought maybe it was supposed to be air soup
1267401 youre going to be horrified because im subverting the chefs intent but when you taste youll see im right these are going to be way better in your garlic soup
1267402 the two countries will accelerate cooperation in economy trade investment culture and tourism and particularly in education
1267403 we think there is no reason for being bullish on the inflation front
1267404 the central bank might be compelled to hike rates again
1267405 les banques refusent daccorder des cr dits aux corse s qui ne peuvent plus acheter leur maison mais elles vendent notre terre aux trangers
1267406 on est venu occuper la banque pour lui demander de mani re ferme que sa filiale cesse toute activit en corse sans a nous irons vers laffrontement en corse
1267407 what concerns me the most is that what youre basing your decision on to terminate mr freshwater is on an incomplete biased and all out lie investigation
1267408 the evidence is clear that mr freshwater overstepped his role egregiously as an educator of science in our public school

1267416 theres a little bit of that let me show you but its balanced by the fact those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
1267417 anybody whos gone through that been beaten up a little bit theres going to be a confidence factor
1267418 not playing last year was probably one of the hardest things i ever had to go through period
1267419 while last year sucked and going through that was tough i dont feel like they were unfair to me if i look at it like an adult they gave me a fair shake
1267420 to be honest with you i wanted a fresh start somewhere else
1267421 i wanted to get out of this market and start all over
1267422 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging
1267423 you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of look at yourself in the mirror
1267424 in terms of going out there and feeling like i can get the job done i feel i can do that
1267425 like i always said if things are important to you you will fight about it
1267426 we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work
1267427 it was intense but it wasnt like we were trying to kill guys
1267428 i let a guy knock the ball out of my hands
1267429 im happy i hope this will solve things and eliminate part of the crime
1267430 ill remind you that were not in beirut and im wondering what a soldier will do to address a burglary or mugging
1267431 in 1992 just for sicily there were 20 000 men today for all of italy there are 3 000
1267432 its clear that this time their support to the police forces will be less basically symbolic
1267433 morgan a un bras et un coude cass il est aussi l g rement bless l paule mais il avait bon moral lorsque je lui ai parl il y a peu de temps
1267434 there are two routes leading to the temple and the barricades put up to streamline human traffic broke down and in the melee everything went haywire
1267435 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
1267436 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
1267437 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
1267438 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
1267439 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work
1267440 become an accessible and important target for the gss general security services for the purposes of recruiting and gathering information
1267441 you have cancer and it will soon spread to your brain as long as you dont help us
1267442 they wanted information about the area where im from about my relatives and neighbors they said if i did not give them the information they would not let me leave
1267443 everybody that comes into israel we have to question them about the reason they are coming especially if they are in a terror organization
1267444 these people are not going to assist us because the moment they come back to gaza they are already suspected of being collaborators
1267445 we do not waste time and effort on people who cannot help us
1267446 we dont question that israel has to protect itself and that maybe it needs to find out something about a person who wants to enter our problem is that they are questioning patients about other people
1267447 you are not allowed to use civilians as part of the conflict
1267448 i think once a person decides to join a terror organization we do not have to bring them into israel for treatment hamas took over they should take care of these people
1267449 the speech will be a formality about the u s engagement with asia especially on security and economic engagement
1267450 america has three key words promote democracy security and the economy in asia protocol wise he cannot declare any significant policies since this is his last speech
1267451 stop interfering in chinas internal affairs under the pretext of human rights and religious issues and avoid damage to china u s relations
1267452 moscow is seriously concerned with the escalation of tension in the region caused by disproportionate use of force by the georgian side
1267453 tbilisi should realize the real threat of the situation developing along a violent path
1267454 it should make effective steps not to allow the further aggravation of the crisis
1267455 there are plans to evacuate all children whose parents give their consent
1267456 it wasnt me it was the general staff its their fault
1267457 thats how it might look from out there but you can never know how risky or how difficult it is to sit up here
1267458 a group of socialists were in favor of a stance in the closure investigation issue they were emphasizing that it was stimulating to run a radical democratization campaign without caring much about being labeled as akp proponents and without associating themselves with the akps attitude
1267459 according to la iner the newly evolving socialist tendency in this split was uttering that the

1267466 he was painting a picture that he was a real urbanite
1267467 he was saying that he knew a lot about baltimore

1267469 is not an owner investor or employee of obsidian realty she also said he is not related to anyone at the firm records show it was owned by harry maclaughlin
1267470 upon his return he will be booked and processed and probably interviewed
1267471 if a baltimore city health officer wants to know how were doing for birth defects and birth outcomes its hard to get an answer
1267472 the same goes for many things that are very important such as alzheimers autism and multiple sclerosis
1267473 asthma and heart disease are things we are just beginning to get a handle on
1267474 the original purpose of the cancer data was to track cancer incidence and look for reasons why cancer rates might be higher or lower in different parts of the country
1267475 now theyre used more broadly many researchers are using the data to look at variations in cancer treatment in different population groups for example and to understand the reasons for those differences
1267476 the system really has enabled us to learn quite a bit about the causes and trends of cancer
1267477 gold is the highest quality silver is still good but you want to aim for gold
1267478 ive spent a good chunk of my career trying to get more registries
1267479 cancer is important but were just scratching the surface on so many other chronic diseases and conditions that we really dont know about
1267480 we are in a state of good relations with the clubs and im a little bit surprised that the clubs are taking such a strong stance not only against fifa but also against the players
1267481 i think the players deserve a little bit of respect when they are asked by their national teams to play
1267482 the accreditation process has already been completed and they cannot be replaced
1267483 the three players are here they are training so please let them play
1267484 the olympic games is something which enhances a players career former germany striker j rgen klinsmann said that the best thing which ever happened to him in football was winning bronze at the 1988 olympics
1267485 the olympic games started in 1896 and i think the olympic spirit should be maintained im sure they the clubs can afford to be without one player perhaps when they come back from the olympics they will be new players and a more valuable asset to their clubs

1267489 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations
1267490 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
1267491 i heard the decision from my lawyer that the cas court in beijing had decided to let me compete and i am very happy to be able to go to an olympic games
1267492 i have already been congratulated by dr thomas bach president of the german olympic sports federation and i am looking forward to joining the team in china
1267493 the itf believes that a transparent and consistent system of entry is the only possible way for tennis as an olympic sport to have credibility with players and fans
1267494 every tennis event around the world uses the world ranking as the basis for entry and the itf finds it difficult to accept that criteria can be changed from country to country depending on the views of particular national olympic committees
1267495 club bud will host eight theme parties with live performances from international djs and cubista dancers as well as a few other surprises the guest list will include olympic athletes sports legends music and movie stars and some very lucky consumers
1267496 it looks like he was going to start all over again the way he operates im sure he would have started a new life in high society circles and probably become an upstanding baltimore citizen

1267505 after a hatching period of 45 to 75 days thousands of baby carettas reach the waters of the mediterranean
1267506 these baby carettas have to work their muscles as soon as they break their eggs otherwise they may suffer from physical disorders so they have to reach the sea by themselves without help when they walk on the sand the blood and smell on their belly cleans up if it is not cleaned up the blood and smell attract other fish waiting in the sea to eat them for that reason nobody should take them and carry them to the sea everything should happen in a natural way
1267507 it was not easy but it was the right time
1267508 my bosses supported me in that decision going to the olympics is a respectable achievement in that sector just like sports the competition is high in business and it requires discipline
1267509 i made up my mind i quit my job at goldman sachs in a week and the following day i was in turkey starting to practice in bodrum in june 2006
1267510 i was expecting that because after my results in the championships i was the first name on the reserve list
1267511 fifteen years on now i am more conscious about the sport tactics wise and fitness wise
1267512 i know my opponents well they know me well the only difference is that i am coming from behind so my leaps can be faster now i am comfortable and i hope i will be the one beating the odds

1267551 with the great efforts of hundreds of forestry workers and villagers we have slowed down the spread of the flames
1267552 if no surprises happen and with a little help of the weather conditions we may put out the fire tonight monday night
1267553 thousands of people including firefighters local forestry officials and residents have been involved in tackling the fire all night
1267554 they have been backed by six helicopters and aircraft began backing the teams after dawn
1267555 the winds are expected to subside and humidity levels are also forecasted to rise this will help our efforts to extinguish the fire
1267556 we have already set up 54 prefabricated houses in the area and we may set up more if need be
1267557 i still believe that the fire was sparked by a fault in the power lines
1267558 the area where the fire started is far away from residential areas and there is not a single restaurant in that area
1267559 it is not true that the fire was started by damaged electricity lines
1267560 unfortunately sometimes you never know how a forest fire started
1267561 for example one villager started a fire to send the locals of the village to fight the fire instead of attending the wedding ceremony of one of his neighbors he fought with
1267562 another man started a fire also to send villagers to the area and kidnapped the girl he wanted to get married in the meantime
1267563 we cannot put an official next to every tree especially those who go to forests for picnic should be extra careful
1267564 our forestry directorate has all the necessary equipment and experience regarding forest fires
1267565 i think the firefighting teams are the best in the world but there are technical problems because the helicopters and planes are on rent and they are expensive i hope that this problem will soon be solved

1267589 the idea of getting a masters or even a degree was the last thing on my mind when i left school and became an air hostess going to university just wasnt something that was encouraged at my school
1267590 but since having my daughter ive become ambitious i was always interested in biology at school so i wanted to take it one step further and pursue a career in something i love
1267591 everyone at uni has been really friendly and helpful and ive learnt so much its fascinating i was one of several mature students who didnt have traditional qualifications and i made lots of friends
1267592 it was sometimes a challenge juggling university and childcare and i spent lots of late nights studying but it was definitely worth it and im so proud of what ive achieved im proof that you can go to university and do well whatever your background
1267593 kellyanne was a first class student from day one and has shown outstanding commitment to the course i am extremely proud of her
1267594 im a big believer in continually developing skills studying at salfords music department gave me the opportunity to experiment with a wide variety of different styles of composition and keep up to date on the latest academic developments in the field
1267595 we went to los angeles to meet a group of researchers who have worked with acoustics experts and musicians to create a virtual womb and record what a baby hears from inside
1267596 working on this programme has been an education for me having the chance to talk to leading researchers and find out what they are working on is great
1267597 it has been really interesting to actually shape a programme and be involved in the scripting and the presenting
1267598 theres some fun stuff in the programme as well as the serious side of science
1267599 we have recordings of a boy singing god save the queen at ages 12 13 and 14 as their voices broke and we edited it all together to show how their voices changed

1267604 it will help decision makers in urban regeneration programmes to collaborate more effectively and to learn key lessons from past mistakes by using case studies of best practice
1267605 each regeneration project involves a few key issues such as land assembly how to mix public and private finance and minimising negative social effects
1267606 however we still dont seem to be able to get all of them right in the same place and at the same time
1267607 a typical emotional reaction to failure is a cant be bothered attitude but if you deal with disappointment and act assertively in a difficult situation you can easily turn a negative into a positive
1267608 parental expectation can be extremely high but students need to stay focussed on their own needs to succeed
1267609 thats not to say that a support network cant be extremely valuable in times of crisis its vital that young people dont isolate themselves when they feel deflated failure is sometimes traumatic and students need to link with other people quickly rather than hiding their feelings
1267610 the most important thing to remember is not to give up you need to be realistic and understand that an alternative course of action can sometimes work out for the best in the long term
1267611 toxoplasmosis is a threat to all warm blooded animals and can be passed on through cat faeces
1267612 if its acquired in pregnancy it can result in foetal infection birth defects or even spontaneous abortion
1267613 thats why sheep farmers are advised not to keep cats and expectant mothers are warned about emptying cat litter trays

1267841 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit
1267842 ecco la differenza dei nostri sentimenti se lui fosse stato al posto mio e io al suo lavrei odiato di un odio che mi avrebbe avvelenata la vita come fiele pure non avrei mai levato una mano contro di lui mostrati incredula quanto ti pare e piace io non lavrei mai privato della compagnia di catherine finch ella avesse mostrato di desiderare la sua non appena tale desiderio fosse cessato gli avrei strappato il cuore e bevuto il sangue ma prima dallora oh tu non mi conosci prima dallora sarei morto a goccia a goccia piuttosto che torcergli un capello

1267847 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi
1267848 mi rendo conto che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo
1267849 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
1267850 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
1267851 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
1267852 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto
1267853 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare

1267889 survey work confirms our earlier estimate that over 1 000 000 iraqi citizens have died as a result of the conflict which started in 2003 we now estimate that the death toll between march 2003 and august 2007 is likely to have been of the order of 1 033 000 if one takes into account the margin of error associated with survey data of this nature then the estimated range is between 946 000 and 1 120 000

1267901 what violence or chance so dragged you from the field of campaldino that we know nothing of your burial place
1267902 across the casentino there runs a stream called archiano born in the apennines above the hermitage there at the place where that streams name is lost i came my throat was pierced fleeing on foot and bloodying the plain and there it was that i lost sight and speech and there as i had finished uttering the name of mary i fell and there my flesh alone remained you are aware how in the air moist vapor will gather and again revert to rain as soon as it has climbed where cold enfolds his evil will which only seeks out evil conjoined with intellect and with the power his nature grants he stirred up wind and vapor and then when day was done he filled the valley from pratomagno far as the great ridge with mist the sky above was saturated the dense air was converted into water rain fell and then the gullies had to carry whatever water earth could not receive and when that rain was gathered into torrents it rushed so swiftly toward the royal river that nothing could contain its turbulence the angry archiano at its mouth had found my frozen body and it thrust it in the arno and set loose the cross that on my chest my arms in pain had formed it rolled me on the banks and river bed then covered girded me with its debris

1267945 whenever there is an incident of terror outfits like vhp and bajrang dal try to build public sentiments against muslims such organizations claim that muslims are responsible for such a terror attack and give irresponsible statements before media against muslims and madrassas such acts need to be strictly prohibited
1267946 this gave rise to an interpretation that the leader of the group had assumed a kuniyat or pseudonym after mohammad afzal guru
1267947 the message itself was sent by email shortly before the 26 7 blasts but if the message was drafted on july 23 why did it not give any advance warning of the bangalore blasts which happened on july 25 were the bangalore blasts carried out by a different group
1267948 we can understand that the bomb blasts have made the officials work difficult but it should not be an excuse for the ineffectiveness we believe that the investigating agency is tackling the issue with childrens gloves the madhya pradesh police have shown results in less than a weeks time about two mysterious deaths we demand a fair probe and punishment for the culprits even if they are high and mighty
1267949 more trade groups and employees union will be roped in after august 11 if the system fails to react
1267950 the decision to form various teams is to facilitate a systematic probe in the case the teams are given specific territories and time frames we have divided the blast sites in five groups including civil and lg hospitals where the strongest explosions took place maninagar hatkeshwar amraiwadi bapunagar naroda thakkarbapanagar khadia saraspur khodiarnagar and the rest of the sites including sarkhej officials will also get the ib and other agencies input
1267951 yashs condition had deteriorated on sunday as he developed a chest infection we have put him on oxygen and changed his antibiotics he seems to be responding to the new medication but his condition continues to remain critical
1267952 yash was mumbling incoherently on sunday where he kept asking for his brother and fought with him on imaginary issue of buying a toffee he is more coherent today he is still in danger and our fingers are crossed
1267953 when i came to know about her case i gave her coconuts free of cost
1267954 my objective is that every poor patient should get coconut water whenever required
1267955 when calamity strikes it does not discriminate i try to relieve the patients misery in my own way i feel my life is so much better than theirs this motivates me to continue these acts
1267956 but after renovation work at the hospital is complete im planning to go to wards myself and give coconuts
1267957 even the existing strength is actually far below what is sanctioned for example 52 432 police personnel have been sanctioned to gujarat police which is plagued by vacancies now even ahmedabad city police should have at least 10 000 now it has no more than 7 500 personnel
1267958 the last that gujarat police saw any induction of fresh blood was in 2000 since then there has been no recruitment especially in the constabulary the state government has instead opted for lok rakshaks at paltry monthly salaries of rs 2 500
1267959 let there be 100 more blasts i will be there helping people till i breathe my last
1267960 i did not notice till i was finished helping people who were injured i noticed i was bleeding from the chest about 25 minutes after the blast
1267961 the shrapnel if lodged in the heart would have led to a fatal injury
1267962 i am optimistic if god has saved me it is to help more people in dire situations
1267963 if we dont take care of our clients someone else will
1267964 one dsp who retired in june was given oral orders to continue for a month while another in the acb was given an extension for a year when he retired in december last year
1267965 when the population is growing the state ought to increase its police strength but this has not happened for the last two decades
1267966 people can see the discrepancy between the governments tall claims of its capability to fight terror and the blasts in the city and the large number of bombs found in surat surely apart from the news about the large number of fatalities and casualties the fact that within 5 minutes of the cm passing by a bomb is found in that place is scary enough these incidents have created a sense of insecurity and fear psychosis for common people who has no security cover to bank on
1267967 if gujarat is progressing so be it why challenge the terrorists in the process the terrorists have shown that they are ready to accept the challenge and also displayed what they are capable of people are wondering why needlessly provoke them now at this stage by putting up such hoardings is uncalled for and people are more scared as a result
1267968 the state government has focused only on industrial growth but all the claims made the chief minister about secure and safe gujarat has fallen flat i no more feel off the hook which the modi wanted gujaratis to feel
1267969 we decided to sponsor the hoarding so that people remain vigilant and have on our own initiative we were not asked by anyone
1267970 i tried every plug out there before settling on g amp h and gave out
1267971 prices were a little higher earlier on monday amid uneasiness over the conflict between iran and the west and due to fears that tropical storm edouard may threaten oil facilities in the gulf of mexico

1267974 we understand indias energy needs and its quest for civil nuclear power
1267975 a single step chemical process has been pursued for decades with little success
1267976 this research breakthrough represents a potentially disruptive step forward in the cost effective processing of these important materials
1267977 such unusually shaped particles should prove valuable in the processing of anisotropic magnets that are highly sought in many dod and commercial applications and are anticipated to lead to lighter and more energy efficient end products
1267978 northeasterns new one step process has the potential to reduce complexity and associated costs of processing samarium cobalt magnets which are used in many advanced dod weapon systems
1267979 the development of stable samarium cobalt nanoparticles using this one step chemical synthesis method may motivate more scientists and engineers to work on the development of next generation magnets
1267980 this work represents the most promising advance in rare earth permanent magnet processing in many years
1267981 i expect it to revitalize international interest in the development of this important class of engineering materials
1267982 our partnership with imdea energy marks a major validation of enable ipcs ultracapacitor technology by a renowned international organization
1267983 partnering with imdea energy solidifies our standing as a leading company with cutting edge energy technologies we are excited by this unique opportunity to help develop clean energy devices that could be a part of the solution to the worlds energy problems and hope it marks the first of many collaborations with imdea energy
1267984 after conducting an exhaustive search of ultracapacitor technologies we chose enable ipc due to the numerous improvements that their process produced over todays current market ready ultracapacitors
1267985 the government of spain is extremely committed to developing environmentally friendly sources of energy and this partnership is an excellent example of how technology can be used to protect the environment while also assisting the economy
1267986 the idea that certain aspects of our universe make it uniquely suited to life has never been properly tested
1267987 god you want me to bless that person are you flipping nuts
1267988 but its a low probability until or unless something else develops

1267992 after strict evaluation and testing to all current requirements underwriters laboratories has issued ul listing for the sunflower solar concentrator system
1267993 we look forward to working with energy innovations and the growing community of solar start ups as well as regulatory authorities government agencies and other stakeholders to further define and develop requirements that will be used to test other solar concentrating photovoltaic products
1267994 this important milestone is a direct result of our entire teams commitment to building best of breed products that exceed expectations in safety reliability and energy production
1267995 the ul mark is one of the most recognized symbols of safety in the world and to say were thrilled to have our work validated by such an independent and reputable institution would be an understatement
1267996 energy innovations mission is to drive the price of solar electricity below the price of fossil fuel electricity
1267997 and the size of the market is trillions of dollars when that goal is reached for more than 50 years since expensive photovoltaic cells were invented people have dreamed of reliably concentrating sunlight to make pv cost effective with the ul approved sunflower concentrator that dream is soon to be realized
1267998 we are looking forward to co locating with the state of oregon at the worlds largest photovoltaic show
1267999 we are working towards establishing a corporate presence in the state of oregon and being a world class photovoltaic supplier of renewable energy
1268000 this think tank of 22 leading academic and industry specialists from china and australia will work together to develop better ways to utilise and distribute electricity
1268001 recognising the strong trade links and shared energy challenges which face our two nations the working group will draw on the expertise of both countries to continue the work begun at this forum towards achieving sustainable electricity supply
1268002 its definitely fair to say you get what you pay for the higher price you pay the better the sound quality and battery life
1268003 wtf i had everything planned to the dot now what the hell am i gonna do
1268004 the material does all the work it produces electrical power just like conventional heat engines steam engines gas or diesel engines that are coupled to electrical generators but it uses electrons as the working fluids instead of water or gases and makes electricity directly
1268005 i like to say that te converters compare to other heat engines like the transistor compares to the vacuum tube
1268006 it comes down to a peculiar behavior of an electron in a thallium atom when it has tellurium neighbors
1268007 wed been working for 10 years to engineer this kind of behavior using different kinds of nanostructured materials but with limited success then i saw this paper and i knew we could do the same thing wed been trying to do with nanostructures but with this bulk semiconductor instead
1268008 we hope to go much further i think it should be quite possible to apply other lessons learned from thermoelectric nanotechnology to boost the rating by another factor of two thats what were shooting for now
1268009 there are clear cost advantages to installing solar panels compared to having transmission lines particularly in areas that are not easily accessible
1268010 moreover solar cells are easier to manage and maintain than other sources such as wind or nuclear
1268011 polysilicon prices are as high as 200 per kilogram since silicon which forms the base substrate for most solar modules is currently experiencing heavy shortage
1268012 the dearth of raw materials is preventing many manufacturing plants from operating at 100 percent capacity driving up the prices of solar modules and hence deterring potential investors
1268013 it is important for industry to work in tandem with academia to unleash the immense power of parallel computing
1268014 were quickly moving the computing industry to a many core world

1268016 our project seeks to deliver electric power that is not only reliable but also compatible with a natural environment in harmony with people and animals
1268017 although the electricity grid has been designed for a one way transfer of power from central station generators to consumers with the distributed generation system being developed at the zoo using on site renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics the grids controls can be adapted for reverse power flows
1268018 all of the zoos exhibits and programs are designed to engage and inspire visitors to treasure the natural world and act wisely on its behalf
1268019 this partnership offers a great opportunity for the zoo to lead by example by developing and testing a renewable solar energy system we hope to reduce the impact on the environment by conserving conventional power
1268020 tampa electric is pleased to partner with usf and tampas lowry park zoo to study and encourage the use of solar power in our communities
1268021 one of our companys strategic goals is to engage the community while dramatically improving tampa electrics environmental profile this is consistent with governor crists challenge to develop and sustain renewable energy resources in florida

1268023 and where there was once one or two big internet marketing firms now there are well over ten in our industry this growth speaks to the power of the information super high way
1268024 with internet gaming in indonesia sales booming we may have to cut back on in person sales teams
1268025 mainly because we are losing money in that operational area as we move forward well give those employees new job opportunities in our gaming in indonesia company before we actually lay them off so that they can continue to grow with our company if they so desire
1268026 i was working 9 to 5 at a marketing firm doing the typical corporate thing now however i have my own website production center and payment processing this allows me to work from home under my own rules and with unlimited income potential
1268027 things in the industry really turned a corner when people began to acquire not maintain customers online
1268028 when acquisiton via online services got big companies in the gaming in indonesia sector finally woke up to the idea that the information super highway was here to stay in a very big way
1268029 we rely on affiliate marketing to drive our gaming in indonesia sales and lead acquisition mostly because some webmasters in our field are better at marketing online than we are
1268030 i prefer to take my time and read about it all online first
1268031 im not a high pressure sales type and rather just go to the store and check out sas soon as possible
1268032 after starting an internet gaming in indonesia sales division in 2003 we saw our sales increase three fold
1268033 and this resulted in the creation of more jobs and employment opportunities in our company our number of employees has doubled and our number of it staff has quadrupled in a years time
1268034 for achieving top search positions especially in the gaming in indonesia market its quality not quantity of web portals that determine sales volume in any given year
1268035 this discussion has opened doors for those that want to get into the gaming in indonesia industry

1268070 i wouldnt say it was intimidating working with them but its tough when you are crossing boundaries i had worked with burt in hooper what you find is they rapidly endorse you over here acting not because of your acting skills but because they respected you as an athlete and eventually pull you in

1268086 a cia counter terrorism official twice said that a high value prisoner or prisoners were being interrogated on the island
1268087 todays time story further demonstrates that the british government has allowed itself to be duped by the us on a colossal scale while ministers have spent years looking the other way british territory has been used for kidnapping extraordinary rendition illegal imprisonment and possibly torture however ignorance is no excuse when it comes to crimes of this magnitude
1268088 the united states must come clean about the existence of its secret prison on diego garcia and the british government must ensure the us does so in february 2008 gen michael hayden the director of the cia stated categorically that diego garcia had never housed a secret prison 3 it now seems that simply isnt true it is time for these evasions to come to an end and for the full details of the cias secret prison system to be revealed
1268089 diego garcia is an obvious place for a secret facility

1268110 for as long as bp is dragging its feet with nominating a new ceo aar is going to step up to the plate and assume greater responsibilities for managing the organization
1268111 we are a 50 shareholder and its in our interest to have the company be managed effectively and make sure nothing falls through the cracks
1268112 theyve got the ceo to leave the country theyve got the 148 bp specialists out and now theyve got the cfo to resign
1268113 the company has a sensible management structure with fail safe mechanisms built into it but not for the extended absence of its cfo
1268114 he felt that these guys were so far apart that there was no realistic chance of a resolution in the near future

1268118 questions of sequestration forests how we deal with our sequestration particularly in terms of coal fired power stations theyre important issues to discuss and work through but in the meantime we really want to get on with it
1268119 by delivering frankly a really comprehensive program which includes renewable energy targets a billion us dollars i announced in the budget in terms of energy efficiency measures in the household were starting to get on the road to actually deal with climate change
1268120 weve laid out through the green paper a process of discussion about these issues and this is another report which contributes to that process
1268121 im sorry i didnt understand could you repeat that please

1268124 this is without doubt the most exciting digital photography announcement this year
1268125 it is always good to achieve a 1 1 draw away from home but the history of football warns us not to take anything for granted azeri players are much better than they were ten years ago and we must not forget that
1268126 i believe we have more class but performing on the pitch is what its about
1268127 we were content when leading but nter showed a lot of patience and confidence
1268128 we must try to capitalise on our advantages in second leg from the first minute if we focus and stay right on top of our game then we have a very good chance
1268129 there is not a chance i will consider that yet and i know the whole team feel the same our minds are on this match against nter and we can think about other games when the time comes this match is decisive for us its our second of the season and to can make it we must give it our all
1268130 we want to first get to the quarter finals then we will see
1268131 the olympics are something special and we are ready to fight there is a good atmosphere in the squad and we have a goal of winning a medal i hope we achieve our objective but there are a lot of good teams involved
1268132 needing to score a goal does not mean we will play risky attacking football from the start
1268133 we must play very cleverly and cautiously of course we have to attack and score so more offensive tactics will probably help us create more chances
1268134 beitar have a very strong midfield which includes three very dangerous attack minded players
1268135 we must score but we will also have to do our best not concede one
1268136 this is nightmare news for us as g owacki is our captain and a very important part of our defensive block
1268137 we do not have a pure central defender to replace him
1268138 the plan was to travel with a cushion to borisov but we did not manage to achieve that
1268139 so now we have to do it in the away match we know we have to score twice and not give anything away but if bate could do it in brussels and if we want to play champions league football then we have to win in belarus
1268140 a season with only two european matches is hard to imagine for anderlecht if anderlecht are left only with domestic matches then there are too many players for too few matches which can cause problems it would also be financially very bad for the club if we dont continue in europe and that is not to mention the uefa coefficient for belgian football now is not the time for talk but to act in borisov every player has to give 200 per cent we just have to win by two or three goals there is no other way we will play for anderlecht and belgian football on wednesday
1268141 mr owens resignation letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands

1268148 he feels it difficult for him to continue working independently
1268149 the potential for the governance model of the company to break down is there
1268150 this guy was giving guarantees and undertakings to outside auditors his position in this situation becomes untenable very quickly
1268151 this is the number one issue for shell marketers and may become the number one issue for all marketers if other majors decide to add this provision to their incentive agreements
1268152 this severely limits the ability of marketers and retailers to switch oil company suppliers and brands
1268153 our members have not expressed significant objections to the repayment of some or all of the money contributed by shell under the incentive agreements according to the formula shell set out in those agreements
1268154 but if the marketer has met its volume commitment shell cant complain about lost profits shell is essentially taking the position that because it is unable to sell the shell branded gasoline at the marketers location it is stuck with that gasoline and will therefore lose profits on it we believe shell will actually sell the gasoline to someone else
1268155 to clarify the point around the collection of unrealized volume
1268156 we dont believe the revised contract language changed the existing terms or our ability to seek liquidated damages
1268157 the revised language is simply an attempt to clarify the language around collection of liquidated damages for not fulfilling incentive contract terms
1268158 shell and motiva have contracts in place to protect both parties during the length of the incentive agreement and it is our position that this provision is an option shell has to lessen the economic loss we suffer as the result of a location not fulfilling a mutually agreed to contract term shell and motiva intend on honoring each of our agreements and we fully expect our wholesalers to do the same
1268159 a fair and balanced resolution that take into effect all circumstances surrounding contract violations by shell wholesalers on occasion extenuating circumstances can arise that may affect contractual performance and as shell and motiva have done in the past we will work with wholesalers to mutually resolve such issues
1268160 the expectation is that most will be calculated at 2 cents per gallon and that the amount owed will be based on the remaining estimated volume not purchased for resale at the outlet during the term of the brand commitment
1268161 no one has a crystal ball on what would be sold
1268162 and its difficult to pass this commitment and potential liability on to a new dealer if the penalty for signing up with shell is much more substantial than signing up with another refiner
1268163 to put this burden on the shell marketer is unfair
1268164 shell has provided our wholesalers best in the industry marketing tools in the form of a robust fuels advertising program a top nascar team sponsorship a build your own building incentive programs and credit card marketing and loyalty programs
1268165 additionally our sales team is focused on growth through wholesale
1268166 cest pas les id es quil vous manque cest la conviction de les r aliser

1268184 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign his leadership post
1268185 we must not allow anything or anyone to distract us from moving forward with this reform agenda
1268186 as you look at key moments in this particular event i think this might be seen as one of those that starts to tip the scales against deweese within the party
1268187 i like him as a human being and i consider him a friend
1268188 i am not sure if he considers me a friend anymore
1268189 we need leaders who are committed to transformational reform we need a monumental shift and we need it now
1268190 we cant do better at least in our caucus until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction
1268191 we need leaders who possess the publics trust bill deweese does not
1268192 once the public trust is shattered it can never be put back together
1268193 bill deweeses presence as the leader of our caucus the face of our caucus dramatically undermines that effort to expand our majority and may even compromise it
1268194 if you do not have a scheduled appointment do not let them in
1268195 many of these people became alarmed and they would do anything to avoid getting arrested
1268196 this is really a serious problem this is really serious stuff

1268200 as a result of that letter we pulled it off the block
1268201 weve had indications from virginia that they would welcome the museum
1268202 but weve not entered into any discussions to do so because we believe valley forge is the preferred location
1268203 how long were going to stick around remains to be seen
1268204 we may well lose the support of the board and abandon it
1268205 its not a little museum thats going to close at 5 or 8 at night its a huge commercial development
1268206 once they pave this its gone forever its going to break my heart is what its going to do because this land should belong to all americans
1268207 it would have been very easy to give this up
1268208 it depends on the cloud we have over us from npca
1268209 have their own parochial reasons why they are opposed to it
1268210 they dont want a successful museum next to a park thats deteriorated bureaucracy and the government is often petty
1268211 our concern is the impact of this museum development on the historic character of valley forge
1268212 if we build the museum its going to be good for the park and the park would be good for arc
1268213 ik las uw site en ik was benieuwd of wij eens met elkaar konden kennismaken om te zien wat we voor elkaar kunnen betekenen

1268223 we are weeding through the applications i believe we are down to under 100
1268224 indeed one might say that as far as the doctrine of justification
1268225 we are weeding through the applications i believe we are down to under 100 but you would be surprised how many people will put down an answer to a question that is just utterly ridiculous when the pile becomes less thats when it is more difficult
1268226 plans were put in place yesterday sunday to make this cat safer it has been moved to a safe house we didnt want to take any chances
1268227 there is more than just this cat its been a spokescat for all animals who dont have homes and there are so many cats and dogs
1268228 you might look at two election cycles to say has this pac that im about to contribute to as a potential professional vendor has it in the past supported or opposed evesham candidates
1268229 its an excellent ban it really is and more townships should follow our lead on it
1268230 the scope of the evesham pay to play ordinance does not include my candidacy for higher office but make no mistake about it when we win our election we will be introducing legislation much like the evesham pay to play ordinance
1268231 based on the facts given it appears to be a violation of the spirit of the local pay to play ordinance
1268232 theres really a lot of frustration about the lack of information or lack of coordination where theyre really concerned that their clients might violate both the law and the spirit of the law
1268233 just simply because they dont know what every municipality has required
1268234 after dinner it was such a beautiful night they went for a ride up the river
1268235 on the way back bob was showing jody how he looks for channel markers and other boats they never saw the other boat they never heard it it just came out of the blue
1268236 it was with the cell phones that they were able to get the position of the boat they had lost all their running lights when they were hit
1268237 to produce a picture of the circumstances surrounding the crash
1268238 i wanted to see what we could do that was doable financially and would make a difference especially for pedestrians
1268239 we all know how dangerous roosevelt boulevard is these timers really give pedestrians the information they need to cross such a wide road
1268240 they have no idea how long that green light has been on

1268247 canadian dairymen should feel justly proud of the position they hold today in the markets of great britain not only is canada the largest exporter of cheese but she also holds the record as to quality not so many years ago our cousins to the south had the inside track in the british market and as they had very little competition they paid more attention to quantity than quality with the very natural result that an opportunity was given for canadian dairymen to try and capture that market how well they succeeded need not be dwelt on here it is sufficient to say that canadian cheese one of our largest manufactured products and exports is competing successfully in the markets of the world against all comers the reason for this is not hard to find it is simply that the quality of the goods appeal to that greatest of all food value experts britain
1268248 it is only a little over fifty years since the manufacture of cheese was undertaken in this province and yet to day it has attained such proportions that it is a big factor in the economic and national life of the country last year the value of the dairy output of canada was estimated at approximately two hundred million dollars and of this upwards of half is to the credit of the good old province of ontario it is well to remember that this grand result in the aggregate was achieved only by the multiplication of small units such as represented by the cornwall cheese and butter board i would be sorry to see any system adopted which would not give adequate rewards for energy industry thrift and ability which have been the cardinal if old fashioned virtues upon which success has been founded in the past
1268249 against this background and in the absence of an imminent threat to the canadian dairy system the panel found that the criterion of necessary to the operation of the governmental restrictions could not be met

1268302 partnering with oakley is a huge step for our organization their recognized leadership and endorsements in sports parallel our commitment at ipt to provide the best playing experience for our membership and were indeed honored to promote their brand in our many events across the country
1268303 oakley was created for world class athletes those who see the limits of possibility as just another challenge their dedication drives us to look beyond the conventional ideas of industry standards its in our dna to identify problems create inventions and wrap those inventions in art and simply to make things better than anyone thought possible
1268304 this agreement with the international players tour ipt is very exciting news for the oakley brand in golf the oakley brand is marketed on every professional tour around the world with over 400 professional golfers utilizing the oakley golf products on the course this opportunity to align with the international players tour ipt the premier net competition tour in the united states creating significant exposure for the oakley brand at the grass roots level of golf is one that we could not pass up hopefully this partnership will only enhance what is already a great product the ipt
1268305 the fruit has been grown locally without the use of pesticides which is very attractive to jp licks and our customers
1268306 we thought it was a terrific idea to tie our jamaica plain store to fruit grown in the neighborhood
1268307 the success weve enjoyed in 2008 can be directly attributed to the strength of our 40 territories across the u s puerto rico and the hawaiian islands though im a tad biased the numbers certainly bear out that our people are among the best in the business
1268308 from what we see in our pipeline we are confident we will set yet another record in august for cases invoiced
1268309 the formula weve created with l amp w investigations local investigations offices supported by a national network is working even in the face of some very trying economic times
1268310 thats why as happy as we are with having a record month of july we know it means working just as hard if not harder to continue the success weve enjoyed thus far in 2008 fortunately we have the right team in place in all our locations to achieve that objective
1268311 coligne engineers ostapeks composite long carbon fibers into a patented high density sagittal plane configuration this enables us to build vbr cages that simulate the bone trabecula architecture of a vertebral body
1268312 the engineering required to meet the extreme demands of veterbral body replament surgery will have many applications in the future
1268313 with todays multidisciplinary oncological treatments and the surgical interventions that can now be performed these patients are living longer some are completely cured and return to active life
1268314 our experience with many metal vbr systems made us understand that the best long term stabilization we can provide patients would be to help them build a suitable bridge of growing bone to replace the vertebra that has been removed and achieve a definitive anterior arthrodesis the ostapek composite vbr design increases the volume of bone graft possible in a modular and stable construct and we are convinced this improves the patients possibilities to create a viable stable and definitive fusion
1268315 we have used the device to treat several patients the most recent involved implantation of an ostapek vbr after the en bloc removal of 4 vertebra the first time in our department
1268316 our early experimental and clinical results are encouraging the ostapek vbr has been the subject of two department publications we are working on another
1268317 it is rare in a surgeons career to be able to work with a new biomaterial
1268318 we have used cobalt chrome stainless steel titanium and various plastics but only recently have we been able to work with long fiber composites that are changing performance in other domains outside spine surgery i have now used ostapek lumbar plates with titanium screws in 50 patients the plate has strength for correction and flexiblity that approaches bone it is also radiolucent allowing us to observe early bone formation through the foramen with normal x ray i am looking forward to using the ostapek vbr
1268319 healthcare is moving toward an era where transparent results will become increasingly crucial for survival
1268320 those leadership teams who are already preparing for that era in their own culture will have an advantage in the times ahead
1268321 this fantastic move forward will not only bring our entrepreneur business community closer together but will also allow high speed communication for entrepreneurs who need immediate answers or who have a need to engage other million impossible entrepreneur members with easy and accuracy although we are a young network and have built our sites with limited funding we are starting to prove that during a recession and worsening financial climate our entrepreneur members are in fact realising that by uniting together we are all growing stronger and wiser above all our members are learning about the importance of being honest honest in sharing their successes and their mistakes our raw honesty is vitally important if we are as a community going to help to protect each others businesses this is great news for our existing members and our future members

1268329 the white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the
1268330 sources say the new data do not indicate the discovery of existing or past life on mars
1268331 the other data not discussed openly yet are far more
1268332 the reason that all this seems so hush hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the american association for the advancement of science aaas and its science magazine whatever the poop is from the scoop thats been studied by phoenix that information is purportedly going through peer review
1268333 heard about the recent news reports implying i may have found martian life those reports are incorrect
1268334 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
1268335 the explorers flight mission appears not to have reached orbit tonight
1268336 spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
1268337 a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together
1268338 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
1268339 the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect
1268340 we have flight four of falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight five right behind that i have also given the go ahead to begin fabrication of flight six falcon 9 development will also continue unabated taking into account the lessons learned with falcon 1
1268341 we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching falcon 1 and develop falcon 9 and dragon
1268342 the basic reality is this for most americans earnings have not kept up with the cost of living
1268343 this is not a new phenomenon but it has finally caught up with the pocketbooks of average people if you look at the earnings of nongovernment workers especially the hourly workers who comprise 80 percent of the work force youll find they are barely higher than they were in the mid 1970s adjusted for inflation the income of a man in his 30s is now 12 percent below that of a man his age three decades ago per person productivity has grown considerably since then but most americans have not reaped the benefits of those productivity gains theyve gone largely to the top
1268344 the normal remedies for economic downturns are necessary but even an adequate stimulus package will offer only temporary relief this time because this isnt a normal downturn the problem lies deeper most americans can no longer maintain their standard of living the only lasting remedy is to improve their standard of living by widening the circle of prosperity
1268345 their unprecedented and growing affluence underscores the gaping inequality between the millions of americans facing stagnating wages and rising home foreclosures and an agile financial elite that seems to thrive in good times and bad
1268346 for a recovery to be robust and sustainable you cant just have consumer demand at nordstrom
1268347 you need it at the little shop on the corner too
1268348 the very wealthy are more likely to invest their earnings wherever around the world they can get the highest return
1268349 this underlying earnings problem has been masked for years as middle and lower income americans found means to live beyond their paychecks but they have now run out of such coping mechanisms the first coping mechanism was to send more women into paid work most women streamed into the work force in the 1970s less because new professional opportunities opened up to them than because they had to prop up family incomes the percentage of american working mothers with school age children has almost doubled since 1970 to more than 70 percent but theres a limit to how many mothers can maintain paying jobs
1268350 the typical american now works more each year than he or she did three decades ago americans became veritable workaholics putting in 350 more hours a year than the average european more even than the notoriously industrious japanese
1268351 americans are reaching the end of their ability to borrow and lenders have reached the end of their capacity to lend credit card debt meanwhile has reached dangerous proportions banks are now pulling back
1268352 as a result typical americans have run out of coping mechanisms to keep up their standard of living that means theres not enough purchasing power in the economy to buy all the goods and services its producing were finally reaping the whirlwind of widening inequality and ever more concentrated wealth
1268353 the answer is not to give tax breaks to the very wealthy and to giant corporations in the hope they will trickle down to everyone else weve tried that and it hasnt worked nothing has trickled down rather the long term answer is for us to invest in the productivity of our working people enabling families to afford health insurance and have access to good schools and higher education while also rebuilding our infrastructure and investing in the clean energy technologies of the future we must also adopt progressive taxes at the federal state and local levels in other words we must rebuild the american economy from the bottom up it cannot be rebuilt from the top down

1268357 after meeting dawn and hearing her story as well as learning about the devastating effects of children born with cdh we immediately offered our services in the production of the first cherubs angel ball
1268358 the angel ball was the planting of a seed for a tradition of annual angel balls as well as raising much needed attention and funds for cherubs
1268359 there are many worthy causes but this was an event which we felt compelled to donate our time and resources to we wanted to create an event for dawn and the families with children affected by cdh that was worthy of their passion and commitment toward getting the word out
1268360 signature events was able to take my vision and make it a reality producing an amazing well thought out one of a kind event that completely exceeded my expectations
1268361 they were able to provide so much more than just their services to cherubs they provided cdh sufferers and their families with a night full of fun and long lasting memories

1268368 the problem is the mindset of marketing people whom are quick to talk negatives and then force themselves into a box dealing with the wrong mindset and mistaken buyers for their developments and not the price of global construction materials that we have no control over
1268369 the market is here to stay so why rock the boat
1268370 common sense in todays market dictates to look at the pricing trend of a preconstruction development if the prices are the same today as they were 6 months ago chances are the project will suffer
1268371 people have to realize that markets especially in real estate go in 10 year repetitive cycles compared to todays situation on world escalation in fuel and construction material costs we have had far worse to contend with in the past two cycles the real estate industry in the philippines and south east asia in general has experienced it was by far worse times during the late 80s and the devastating effects of the asian financial crisis near the end of the 90s with a very limited market base
1268372 global investors are looking to replace failed pension plans and other future saving schemes with a solid investment in real estate many are looking for investments that will give them an income for retirement savvy investors are now looking for a more solid investment with potential for monthly income and philippine condo hotel investments are ideal because philippine hotel rates are the same if not more expensive than those in the us or europe but the entry level to purchase real estate is only about 10 of what you would have to pay for a studio in manhattan
1268373 buying property here is easier than many people think and investment from overseas in tourism real estate is growing especially in the resort areas of cebu and manila itself where rental potential is good

1268389 the average height of the maldives is 1 5 metres above mean sea level therefore if the rate of sea level rise per century is 59cm it would take a couple of centuries at the most to totally inundate the entire maldives
1268390 that of course will happen only if there is no concrete action to address the issue at a global stage
1268391 it is further evidence that our country is in peril and that timely action is needed to ensure our future survival
1268392 our tourism industry will be affected for certain the stretches of white sandy beaches are one of the main assets of our tourism industry
1268393 climate change will lead to an increase in stormy weather and coral damage too these are major concerns for the maldives
1268394 the main threats to our island nations survival global warming and sea level rise emanate from beyond our geographical borders
1268395 we do not wish to become environmental refugees and we will not leave the maldives unless we are forced to
1268396 it indicates on the contrary that sea level rise is a clear and present danger
1268397 these figures clearly demonstrate the need to act urgently as sea levels are expected to continue rising for many decades and centuries

1268400 i have a very specific interest in jeremy bentham and i know that youve chosen philosophers in the past that obviously like john locke and david hume im wondering i have two questions one who chose the name jeremy bentham and b was he chosen because of his creation of the panopticon prison where an entire society is being watched but they dont know it
1268401 at the end of season 3 we see a piece of this obituary that jack hands to kate and you see you know his thumb is obscuring certain parts of the name i think you see the j and everything up until the tham so we had chosen jeremy bentham a year ago together we basically have a list of philosophers names to be employed and as soon as we knew that locke was going to using an alias it was sort of a given and the panopticon is obviously among other things why we selected that name

1268446 unreasonable payment dating and raising interest rates on pre existing balances
1268447 the federal regulatory process has been neglected for years in terms of credit card practices
1268448 and finally after about 2 000 complaints were registered about different credit card practices federal agencies finally came forward and decided to exercise their authority under the truth in lending act to impose some new regulations on the credit card industry
1268449 making sure you have a reasonable amount of time to pay your bill before youre socked with late fees and penalties and interest charges making sure that if you pay on a balance that that money is applied to your highest interest outstanding debt and making sure that they cant bump up your interest rate dramatically without warning
1268450 there are a lot of proposed rules that never see the light of day
1268451 if enough critical comments are received and not enough favorable comment they have the discretion to either kill those rules or water them down or adopt them if they have good comments we wanted to make sure ohioans voices were heard in washington and that we spoke out strongly in favor of these rules
1268452 recently we have seen the disastrous results of predatory lending and lack of consumer protection as a result of the unregulated lending policies unfortunately it is always those least able to fight back that are targeted its time for responsible government guidelines and oversight of lending institutions that would prey upon innocent uninformed public please do the right thing for the people you swore an oath to protect
1268453 i am in full support of any changes that you can make to eliminate the loan shark provisions that credit card companies currently operate under thanks for your efforts
1268454 we also need an education program for pre college age young people for the long term dangers of credit in general
1268455 we were really concerned with the breed specific part of the legislation
1268456 this ended up in a workable compromise which is what democracy is all about
1268457 we did not need to over legislate there is already state legislation dealing with vicious dogs i hope that will be sufficient
1268458 i agree there does not need to be more legislation
1268459 i also agree that we need more accountability and clearer communication so that people know who to report complaints to i think well have that
1268460 it was pretty nice to look up there at the new
1268461 that gets you fired up its starting to look nice here its starting to look division i ish
1268462 the new guys who havent been here and havent kept up with the construction had no idea the scoreboard was going to be that big and impressive i think seeing it got guys revved up and it carried over to practice
1268463 im not going to lie i usually look forward to playing the big away games more than i do at home because you get that actual college football experience hopefully this renovation helps to encourage the fans to come out and support us
1268464 ive been around long enough to know that the first day they are all going to be a little nervous
1268465 the freshman half of them are hyperventilating before they even get on the field
1268466 you could see when matt did hit the ball he was really explosive
1268467 he is going to calm down and be more consistent as we go along he has a really strong leg he has very good mechanics and he gets the ball out quick which is really impressive
1268468 the other guy who was really impressive is our new long snapper ryan hidalgo thats another true freshman out there who didnt get noticed because all of the snaps were really good so that was another sigh of relief
1268469 and by then we wont lack for anything after about two weeks well start preparing for boston college

1268471 mogadore football is more than just the games we win
1268472 dont get me wrong we are very proud of our past success but at the same time mogadore football represents our entire community
1268473 when we win a game i think the community truly feels like they are winning something too
1268474 winning every year is not as easy as it seems
1268475 sometimes it seems like the standards are set so high that when one of our teams loses one or two games they feel like the season is lost
1268476 last year we only lost one game then lost in the playoffs and i kept telling the kids that they still had an incredibly special season
1268477 they still accomplished great things the season was a success and they should be very proud of what they did
1268478 i think what makes mogadore football so special are the families
1268479 so many people come back to the games to watch and support the current years team everybody wants to give back to the program
1268480 i think sometimes the fact that it is mogadore football that the kids dont get enough credit as they should
1268481 every year there is a new group of kids that are working really hard trying to build on what the previous years team did
1268482 dont put pressure on yourself by getting caught reading all the banners work hard for the chance to raise your own banner
1268483 well if you mean that because i like to fuck that i like giving blow jobs and i swallow and i love having my pussy eaten then

1268492 it pushes heavy stuff around all day long just like joe
1268493 he was only the fourth rookie lineman to make the pro bowl
1268494 coming in as a rookie i wanted to have a hall of fame career
1268495 thats the goal you want to be the best of the best if you dont youre not working hard enough
1268496 we put him on their best defensive player every game and he gave up one sack as a rookie that doesnt happen a lot we expect a lot from him and hes up to it every week
1268497 it was like gosh he makes it look so easy and even if he is off balance hes able to get himself back into position hes just one of those pros who just has it and not everybody has it like he does hes one of those guys who is going to be special for a long time in this league its fun to watch him play
1268498 there wasnt a whole bunch of things last year where it was man i was terrible
1268499 i think i did some things that were ok i think my technique can get better and that has been the thing weve been working on
1268500 i was in middle school when i saw them play in the pro bowl that was a pretty cool thing for me
1268501 hes been considered one of the best players in football for a while now hes been doing it for so long and hes just so professional at everything i wanted to just watch him work
1268502 being an offensive lineman nobody notices you or knows your face or paints a forklift after you
1268503 its the kind of thing thats unique to a cleveland type town where the people really respect the guys in the trenches the blue collar guys on the line
1268504 will the site flood will a tree fall on me will the wind rip the stakes from the soggy ground is anything touching the wall of the tent where itll get wet will all the spiders in the forest take refuge with me what will i do if i finish my book when should i venture out to get the foodbag thats hanging from a tree when will it stop i bet these polypropelene clothes would melt onto my skin if i catch fire how long can i lie here listening to this rain

1268512 is very funny but frankly it must mean obama really has been portraying himself as a messiah to people and they have been buying it mccain has recognized it and i hope you have too
1268513 survey results released by the non partisan pew research center for the people amp the press indicate that while a majority 53 identify obama as a christian 16 of conservative republicans 16 of white evangelical protestants and 19 of rural americans believe the illinois senator is muslim

1268518 he gets excited and jumps in to get the toy
1268519 he tore captain buzzard apart today we had to duct tape him back together
1268520 we very quickly found out that he liked jumping off docks into water
1268521 we noticed some lumps along his jaw and on the backs of his legs
1268522 by the end of october we had to rush him to a vet one morning he was having breathing difficulties they did a needle biopsy and everything and he was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer at that point he was given three months to live

1268530 this is not a how to guide to becoming batman were talking about extreme adaptation
1268531 hes the most trained person we can imagine he represents the pinnacle of human performance
1268532 i could if i started young enough trained myself the way young bruce wayne did then maybe some day i could be just like batman
1268533 well i never did that kind of training and so remained ordinary but i knew i could have and that was a good portion of the characters appeal
1268534 what has always fascinated people about the character is he was able to accomplish what he did because he had the will to do it and trained himself to a point where everyone else couldnt
1268535 were continually called upon more and more as citizens to hold opinions on scientific questions like nanotechnology or stem cell research or global warming

1268613 sats have become little more than vanity testing proof for the government of rising standards in primary schools which the consumers of these results secondary schools arent buying its expensive for primaries not trusted by secondaries and damaging for children
1268614 standards in our schools are rising which is a factually incorrect statement sats scores rose at the beginning but have now levelled off and sats are not an accurate measure of standards and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test even though it clearly is results have improved significantly since 1997 for both 11 and 14 year olds because teachers teach to the test as their league table position depends on it and those results are in turn reflected in higher gcse results which are manipulated to an even greater extent through gnvqs and decreasing grade boundaries we are already trialling changes to testing which allow teachers to choose when their pupils take new single level tests

1268623 he was just knocked back and stunned he is up and about already
1268624 were not sure that they really were death eaters mom
1268625 the people who attacked had the chance to do much worse to the waiter than just stunning him if they really were death eaters making a real attack the whole place would have been completely sacked there would be casualties and a dark mark floating around over lulliloo village i think those were some wannabe copy cats
1268626 the last thing we would need now is a new breed of people imitating death eaters in this country in addition to the continuous threat of real death eaters from the outside i hope that investigation puts this possibility to an end or we are in for a lot of trouble
1268627 well i dont think we should stress over it too much for the rest of the day well read all about it in tomorrows wizarding world today and hopefully hear how the investigation is coming along by then
1268628 well i guess i wont be finding out about that for a while now might as well see what i can do now that i have the house all to myself
1268629 i dont know what you want but if you dont get out right now ill have the aurors here to deal with you
1268630 madam marla its me mat i was in here yesterday with my friends before the attack i came to see you
1268631 i really have no idea im just glad they are gone and havent hurt anyone i told the aurors to leave me alone because i didnt want any more trouble
1268632 do you know if anyone might have a grudge against you are you particularly firm in any stance that people might disagree with
1268633 since when do death eaters ever have a reason for attacking innocent people
1268634 all they do is go around and cause mayhem shooting that dreadful dark mark wherever theyve been to ensure that everyone knows what happened no one has to do anything to become a target
1268635 those owls sure have a way of tracking people down
1268636 yes but this one in particular seems to have a bit of an attitude problem
1268637 ill try to but trouble has a habit of getting in the way of my nose

1268649 its a good thing this young witch alerted us weve sent a message to the presidents office and the whole auror department is on high alert
1268650 its scary though we werent expecting an attack like this for months considering the full scale effort on the european front
1268651 there were only three of them and the only real damage they did other than messing up the restaurant was stunning the waiter over there i dont think they were really death eaters
1268652 who are you and did you seriously call me a bloke
1268653 my name is vanessa twinkle im here on holiday from canada with some friends and was having quite a wonderful time until just now thanks to you bloke
1268654 it was an accident i only just walked out of the restaurant you were flying low we didnt see each other
1268655 we dont have any of those around my house we only have up to the nimbus 2002
1268656 so vanessa how has your holiday been you said you were staying here with some friends
1268657 yes i am staying with some friends of mine here in the village my holiday has been great ive been getting a lot of shopping done here because things are cheaper and there are some items here that are unavailable up north oh the looks on my friends faces when they see me on a firebolt
1268658 this is the place that i most likely will end up with im just working out the fine details on how to secure the funds
1268659 im thinking i might just put up a down payment and move in and use my savings to make the first few payments and then use the money from the hospital wing apprenticeship to finish it off like you said mat i should move in before the prices pick up
1268660 lets go see what your number one would have been
1268661 alright its on the north side of the village we can walk there its a nice day for a stroll anyways
1268662 so what can i expect to be different coming from durmstrang
1268663 well bsm isnt your typical school of magic thats for sure
1268664 first of all its not strictly a boarding school some students who choose to come here from farther away can opt to live in the dorms but most of the students in the area stay with their families some of the older students mostly seventh years may get their own place if theyve been saving up like joel
1268665 the idea came from the headmaster edwin brownie who also is the founder of the school you see he used to go to hogwarts back in the day and after he was denied a position as a potions master a position which we are told was a very popular one at the time he moved to the united states and decided to start up his own school here since there were only two other ones in the country hes tried to improve on the formula that most schools of magic use and personally i think he has
1268666 hes done away with the sorting and house system that hogwarts and some other schools have he explained once that it was because he it separated him from his friends and formed rivalries between them that he had no interest in he made the boarding school optional because he didnt like the people in his house and he wished he could live in one of the apartments in hogsmeade he asks some of the seventh years help teach first years particularly those who show an interest in going into teaching its basically like a tutoring service
1268667 the school is ten times better because we are there
1268668 i wish i could afford this place but i just dont have the galleons think of all the parties that could take place here and out here on the balcony i could put up a hammock and lay back and enjoy the view
1268669 i wouldnt mind leaving here either do you care if you have a roommate who can split the rent
1268670 i guess the crowd hasnt died down since we left
1268671 nick amy and serena might not have noticed that we even left
1268672 my friends arent expecting us until later this afternoon so we can go around and start picking up stuff i need for school
1268673 first stop is to madam truethreads i need to get some new robes its just up the street from here but stay close by its really crowded and i dont want you falling behind or getting lost
1268674 first customers of the day come here young ones what are we shopping for today dress robes casual wear robes for school perhaps all three considering you are walking around in poor mugglewear come now madam truethread will make you glamorous
1268675 you can pick one if you want ill pay for it
1268676 these are really nice thanks for buying them for me mat now i really look like i belong here
1268677 we have to go to pollys potions next with this crowd its going to take some time to get there so how about we fly
1268678 are you crazy you are going to get us killed
1268679 you are crazy but that was the most thrilling experience ever it totally puts space mountain to shame
1268680 you know why everyone loves disney world and claims its the most magical place on earth its because walt disney was a wizard he loved muggles but felt bad that they couldnt experience magic so he created disney world and disney land he was ostracized by the sizable portion of the wizarding world who dont like muggles but that didnt stop his effort i thought the whole project was pretty clever a lot of memory modification was involved with that one thats for sure
1268681 hey nick i want you to meet my friend jessica jessica this is nick
1268682 aha this must be your muggle friend what a pleasure to meet you
1268683 but you were good at it i mean you got an exceeds expectations on the o w l
1268684 yes but it was more or less a fluke that it happened i had just happened to study the right material the week before and remembered it you actually earned your outstanding besides im much happier knowing that while you have double potions first thing in the morning i have free time to do whatever i want
1268685 i absolutely love this place do you think they would let a muggle live here
1268686 well not in this community but there are a few smaller magical communities that have a tiny population of muggles
1268687 im sure you could understand why not many wizards or witches would want to live in a place where they always had to be careful not to do magic in the presence of muggles and hide their true abilities
1268688 hey that was some quick thinking with the essence of murtlap
1268689 shut up i didnt break it on purpose it was an accident and there is no point to just blame me
1268690 well for whatever reason you are here ms twinkle im grateful that you are
1268691 uhh not that im not glad you are here too mat thanks for fixing me up i feel good as new
1268692 i was wandering rather aimlessly around the village practicing my disillusionment charm i have spent most of the summer trying to make it strong enough to render me invisible for a period of time it might have been easier for me to practice in front of a mirror but i wanted to get out and about to enjoy this wonderful weather so i ended up walking up an alley way and came across a meeting of some kind but they didnt notice me so i was just hanging around trying to find out what the meeting could be about if it was being held at the far end of some alley way anyways i recognized one of the wizards as the shorter wizard who attacked madam marlas yesterday
1268693 i tried to see if i could recognize anyone else in the group there were about fifteen of them huddled in a tight circle i had trouble hearing what was being said from where i was so i moved around a bit straining to hear i lost concentration on the disillusionment charm and became visible again i only realized that after i saw one of the group members start staring at me in shock i was about to disapparate away but the wizard who saw me disarmed me on the spot and another knocked me backwards into a wall with some wild hex i started running away from them as they continued launching spells at me i dodged a few by luck but one of the spells hit the wall just over my head and knocked some of the bricks onto me i managed to get away far enough to transform into a kneazle and escaped them as i got into that alleyway behind us i transformed back and then i collapsed here
1268694 we have to get you back to anna and amys house house they sent me an owl a little earlier saying that they have uncovered some more clues about the attack and im sure this discovery will be crucial
1268695 you know mat isnt really doing the justice the story deserves
1268696 he left out a few of my death defying barrel rolls
1268697 our mom has a friend who works in the auror department and she asked about the investigation findings and learned that there was no investigation launched and that there wasnt even a report filed that an attack took place
1268698 so she told them not to continue with the investigation out of fear really she just wanted it to be over with and she didnt want that group to return but that doesnt explain why there wasnt even a record of there being an attack
1268699 okay we know that there is a small group of people who attacked madam marlas restaurant we think that those people were part of a slightly larger group in both encounters those people didnt use any deadly curses or hexes even though they clearly had the opportunity to seriously injure nick or that waiter
1268700 and we are not sure why there was no report filed at the auror department but i think it is way too early to jump to any conclusions about this group infiltrating the government
1268701 some of our cousins and their friends have decided to come visit
1268702 dont say it like that dear we are glad to have them over we havent seen them in such a long time
1268703 what do you think about that meeting of the village council to open up a section of the village for a small muggle population next week
1268704 one of my best friends happens to be a muggle
1268705 shush dear its okay we know you didnt mean it
1268706 we really cant stand them if we werent related we never would have let them come over and visit for so long
1268707 if i had to see those kids at school every day i think i might go insane they just drive me up the wall
1268708 jessica would be happy to hear the possibility of the village opening up to muggles
1268709 though the other muggles wouldnt be able to see the magical aspects of the village she should have no problem with that since she already knows about it and because she has already been in the magical parts she should be able to cross over the usual anti muggle enchantments
1268710 yeah if she knew about it she would have her things packed in about five minutes and be ready to walk out the door i wouldnt mind sitting in on that meeting next week if its possible
1268711 we were planning to go to it so you could come with us
1268712 even though mat was quick with the shield charm i wasnt too sure it would have held that huge flaming roof back
1268713 i have been spending the summer here in the village with my friends who happen to be strong supporters of muggles and the idea that wizards and witches should try to reintegrate with the muggle world they dont see the fundamental divisions between muggles and wizards like most other people with magical powers do they believe that muggles are able to appreciate the nature of magic and not expect wizards and witches to solve all their problems with magic after all there are plenty of problems in the magical world as it is
1268714 my friends and their families were the ones who brought up the idea of allowing at least a portion of lulliloo village to be open to muggles again and managed to get a town meeting about it which is about the farthest that anyone else who harbored the same feelings have been able to get the meeting is supposed to be in a few days so rather than have the possibility of any changes an opposing group has been trying to mess everything up weve been trying to figure out who they are exactly but from what weve gathered they are a small new chapter of the death eaters started here in the americas its hard to imagine but they are even more vile than the death eaters around the world this group doesnt even go under the name of the death eaters though and dont answer to voldemort weve learned that they call themselves the broken dagger
1268715 the irony of them is that they use a muggle weapon even though they hate the muggles so much
1268716 they take some daggers and split them open so they can put their wand inside it then reforge them giving the daggers dark magical properties when the group sets out to kill people off they always manage to kill them by stabbing them from behind the wounds inflicted by the daggers are currently incurable but the healers at st lukes and across the country have been working furiously to research a way to combat them there havent been many reports of their activities lately though and there isnt anyone alive who can explain anything about them other than the findings of limited investigations
1268717 after you had told me that madam marlas was attacked my friends learned of another much smaller group within the village who were mimicking the broken dagger and death eaters but on a much smaller scale they share the same principles as both larger groups but havent sought to hurt anyone yet just put a scare into people its worked so far because most people are panicking about the thought that the death eaters bring the war closer to home weve explained everything weve learned to the auror department who feared that the broken dagger may try to absorb this small group and begin expanding it looks like their fears are justified because it is the broken dagger who are out there tonight and who blew up my friends homes just to flex their muscle and prove that they are a force to be reckoned with
1268718 oh it was great grammys dog had puppies and since they couldnt take care of all of them i convinced mom to let me bring one back to our house
1268719 yeah it was only announced that there was going to be a meeting and tryouts this morning
1268720 darren ohare captained the irish national team three times and is credited with the invention of the chaser hawkshead attacking formation how did you not know that
1268721 joel i havent seen you since school let out how are you doing man
1268722 oh im doing great i got accepted into that apprenticeship program did you
1268723 yeah i cant wait the only downer is that there wont be any time to play quidditch so im not even bothering to try out for the team this year
1268724 you guys might want to move fast if you want to get a nice place for not too much money especially if this quidditch team kicks off the ground prices are going to shoot up real fast
1268725 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1268726 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1268727 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1268728 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1268729 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1268730 we saw the rise in food prices and were very pro agricultural commodities we also did well holding insurance companies
1268731 hypocritical and political there is a lot of noise around this things are being made up on the hoof to keep political masters happy
1268732 people want to find a scapegoat we were 0 28 short on bradford amp bingley stock that was a 1m position it is not our fault that bradford and bingley was in trouble
1268733 investors should be starting to look further out and be expecting to make the real money some few years hence with the view that buying shares over the next nine months may feel painful but may turn out to have been not only courageous but brilliantly timed
1268734 i have had nightmares in the last couple of weeks
1268735 i had to be rushed into emergency and i couldnt walk on my foot for two days it was a poisonous spider
1268736 we went back home at night and i had a really bad fever i woke up in the night and couldnt stand on my foot by the morning my foot was like a red balloon and i had a red line all the way up inside my leg
1268737 i was thinking that somebody somewhere had a little doll and was sticking pins in but something like that just makes you more determined to fight it off they thought i might need an iv drip but in the end i had to have strong oral medicine i couldnt put my foot down and couldnt run for four days i still have scabs and have lost all the skin around my toe
1268738 you cant make a definite decision because im running on a leg that could break down
1268739 every time i go out i am planning to start the race and run well there have been lots of points where i thought am i going to make it
1268740 i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape
1268741 i know from what i have done that i am good enough to be on the start line im racing unless my leg breaks down and i cant run that has already been decided
1268742 the meetings can be a bit lively but overall what he ferguson is doing is in the interests of manchester united and thats what he always thinks of in those meetings if he wants to keep the player hell do everything he can to do so and hell probably succeed as well
1268743 we know cristiano ronaldo is an incredible player and we dont have a problem about him coming here the gal cticos are the past i think the best of real madrid now is the group and the dressing room
1268744 if he comes he will excite the fans for sure at the bernab u the supporters are used to watching all the best players in the world and cristiano ronaldo is now one of the best players in the world
1268745 my next voyage will begin in a few days time gloria i love you and ill marry you when i come back ill think about you all the time and ill write to you and send you a present from every port
1268746 of course you cant expect sl has such lousy retention
1268747 for crying out loud when are ll actually going to fix
1268748 ffs linden labs do you think we like being dragged upside down by the stirrups for mile after painful mile 111
1268749 ya know i always suspected he was riding side saddle

1268759 they said that they are serving 127 families in those 99 units so theyre actually getting people who are already homeless and asking them to double up in shelter because theres not capacity to house them elsewhere

1268791 evictions should not result in rendering individuals homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights where those affected are unable to provide for themselves the state party must take all appropriate measures to the maximum of its available resources to ensure that adequate alternative housing resettlement or access to productive land as the case may be is available

1268799 he said he told the attendant he wanted r100 but he was on the phone and talking to someone about a car and he said r250 meaning r250 000 we offered to siphon the petrol out of his car but he refused and he refused to give us the r150 so we said we would lay a charge against him
1268800 when we went to the police station he was there waiting for us and a policeman told him to just pay the r150 but he stormed off i probably would have accepted it then he was arrogant instead of just sorting it out
1268801 he said he wants to settle it now but i have taken a stand it is critical that we nip this in the bud
1268802 there have been 40 cases that i am aware of but i am sure there are more in a number of cases it is intentional motorists take the number plates off at home and wait until no one is looking at the service station and then speed off
1268803 it is getting so tough out there the line between criminal activity and survival is becoming so blurred
1268804 but it is not like it is poor people driving in skondonks stealing r50 petrol to get home there were women driving new mercedes and audis on the video footage i have seen
1268805 if we dont treat this as a principle issue it is going to be out of hand as service station owners we have to make a stand we cant say let the customer do what he wants
1268806 customers who are honest that make a genuine mistake usually agree to pay or let us take the fuel out but those who are up to nonsense say dont touch my car
1268807 it is up to motorists to get out the car and ensure that they get the right fuel and the right amount of fuel into their vehicles we would like to put up signs telling customers this but the oil companies will not allow it because they say it spoils their branding
1268808 after studying the schedule of real madrid and the dutch team i realised playing for both teams would mean too tough a physical load for me and therefore i made this choice
1268809 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro 2008 finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1268810 i had a comprehensive conversation with ruud and i can do nothing but respect his decision
1268811 i regret that i cant use his quality and experience when i compose my squad but i wish him all the best at real madrid
1268812 he said i may be over the limit he asked me to do a breathalyser test and then changed his mind saying i dont think a girl like you wants to go to jail
1268813 i asked him to do the breathalyser test because he wanted to take me to jail but he refused and he said if he did the breathalyser test i would probably be over the limit
1268814 i never did a breathalyser test so i wasnt sure why i had to go to jail he asked me what we could do about this
1268815 he didnt mention money specifically but said he wanted something he told me to stop and park on frederick drive northcliff and went out to his friend he came back and told me his friend needed something
1268816 a motorist is required to comply with the officer until the officer has completed his or her inspection issued the motorist a ticket or executed an arrest
1268817 its odd but he has the authority to arrest her on suspicion alone
1268818 if an officer is talking in the way of soliciting a bribe take down some form of identity so that there can be an investigation into the matter
1268819 try to take down the officers number plate the vehicle number precinct and name
1268820 except that its not because we dont live in that house anymore and i have no idea where it is here where we actually do live
1268821 ive made breakfast and we are all waiting on you
1268822 i was watching some shows on the food network and thought i would try to make a breakfast that looked as good as the ones i saw
1268823 hey mat you wouldnt happen to know some spell to get the county to just hurry up and sign the papers so i can get this job going again do you
1268824 yeah just this last year to get through before im finished with school
1268825 thats pretty cool i wish i only had to go through seven years of school and be done with it all im just about to start going to the university so i still have another four years before im done with it
1268826 if there was some way i could go see one of those quidditch matches you were telling us about yesterday they seem very exciting
1268827 some of my friends from school are on the quidditch team they live in a magical community in washington d c they had asked me if i wanted to play tomorrow because they need to get some more practice in before the season starts but they need an extra player you could come watch if you like
1268828 i have never seen a magical community what is it like how are we supposed to get there washington is a long drive it would take hours oh but the drive would be so worth it
1268829 oh i had just passed my apparition test this past year
1268830 yeah its pretty useful the only problem is most buildings are are enchanted so that people cant apparate or disapparate inside them it would be pretty chaotic if people just kept popping up randomly in crowded places not to mention the security aspects of it wouldnt want the bad guys to just pop into government buildings or the wizarding schools
1268831 i would be able to apparate both of us just inside the community there if you want to go
1268832 i mean disappearing and reappearing somewhere else might be normal for a wizard but is it dangerous for a muggle to go with you
1268833 no its not dangerous its just uncommon for that situation to occur the only time wizards or witches would allow a muggle to side along apparate with them is if there was some imminent danger to their lives like if they were being attacked or the building they were in was on fire or something there shouldnt be a problem with jessica going along with me if you are okay with it that is
1268834 i think its alright just make sure you keep an eye on her mat shell probably see something whiz by and follow it and get lost or something not that she would mind im sure shed love to never leave that magic community
1268835 you really didnt have to go through the trouble of all this mat

1268837 quem dera que o problema fosse o meu des nimo
1268838 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1268839 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1268840 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1268841 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1268842 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1268843 hes been the best ambassador our state has ever had
1268844 he could live anywhere in the world and he came back home
1268845 i just think it shows a lot about him as a person and how grounded he is
1268846 in fact hitler was absent on the days in question and the german athletes and german public welcomed and praised owens just like everyone else
1268847 tinatapos na kasi namin ang mga last taping days ng
1268848 ang then magpe prepare na ako para sa shooting ko for
1268849 kaya nakakalokah ang schedule ko talaga as in nakakabaliw pero enjoy naman ako kasi ang daming trabaho kaya yung date date naku nakakalimutan ko munang gawin siguro kapag may naisingit na libreng araw why not di ba okey naman si marvin e
1268850 hindi nga ba matagal na akong walang boyfriend kaya ang tagal kong hindi nakakapag date gusto ko naman ma feel ulit iyon
1268851 kaya noong magsabi si joross kung puwede ba akong i date okey lang kasi nataon na libre ako noong araw na iyon kaya hayun naka date ako ulit simpleng date lang naman iyon parang wala lang nag date tayo
1268852 natural itatanong ko iyon di ba kaibigan ko naman si joy tunay na pangalan ni diana at siyempre bilang respeto tanungin ko muna si marvin kung ano ba ang namamagitan sa kanila
1268853 kung friends lang sila okey siguro kung mag date kami wala namang masama sa date di ba pero ipapaalam ko pa rin yun kay joy ngayon kung malaman ko na serious pala itong si marvin kay joy bakit naman ako lalabas with him nakakahiya naman di ba
1268854 hindi pa nga kami nagde date e may ligaw na sobra naman yon
1268855 siguro wait ko muna na mag date kami ni marvin kung magtanong siya may isasagot naman na ako sa kanya if ever sa ngayon wala pang ganyan hanggang text text pa lang naman kami wait nyo na lang kung ano ang mangyayari di ba
1268856 may nagsabi nga sa akin tungkol sa nangyari kay jen at siyempre nagulat din ako kasi huli kong nakita si jen mga three or four months pa lang ang tiyan niya so matagal na kaming di nagkikita at hanggang pag text lang kami ngayon
1268857 nagsabi naman ako kay jen na kung kailangan niya ng anumang tulong kahit financially huwag siyang mahiyang tumawag sa akin
1268858 parang magkapatid na kami ni jen dahil ilang projects na rin ang pinagsamahan namin hindi ako magdadamot sa kanya dahil kaibigan ko siya kahit sino naman sa batch namin sa starstruck ready akong magbigay ng tulong basta alam kong kailangan talaga
1268859 huwag naman na niyang tanggihan isipin na lang niya na para sa baby niya ito bilib nga ako sa kanya dahil kahit malaki na ang tiyan niya pilit pa rin siyang nagwu work nakakabilib talaga kasi kung ako buntis hindi na ako magwo work ng sobra pababayaan ko ang mister ko na magtrabaho
1268860 so kung ano man ang maibigay kong tulong kay jen huwag na niyang tanggihan galing iyon sa sincere na pagtulong ko
1268861 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1268862 theres nothing there it didnt happen see everyone is ok
1268863 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death
1268864 and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed

1268868 the blame for the worlds higher temperature rests on gas guzzling vehicles
1268869 his choice to drive a v8 hemi powered chrysler 300c
1268870 i just wanted to let you know that pump 9 isnt working it seems to be broken
1268871 well yes of course ill do that but i thought you might like to know that its broken
1268872 maybe you could call someone to fix it or at least put a sign up so no one else wastes their time on it
1268873 the big question in survey research is how fast that number is growing
1268874 just a few years ago pollsters gained virtually nothing by dialing mobile phone numbers
1268875 since virtually all mobile phone users also had wired home telephone service
1268876 the obvious solution having interviewers hand dial each number slows down the process and increases cost
1268877 there are some risks when trying to reach cell phones
1268878 theres a portability issue the person may be involved in another activity a liability issue the person may be driving or performing a task where they shouldnt pick up the phone and a financial issue the charging of minutes to the persons being called
1268879 ill go back to the 2000 2004 and 2006 elections and see how much percentage of a particular age group voted and well match that in our sample
1268880 the best way to get accurate numbers is to simply get in touch with that segment of the population
1268881 but weve been able to gauge youth voter turnout pretty well in the past so im not worried yet
1268882 it is a problem and were developing strategies because its going to be more and more of a problem
1268883 the first step well be taking is getting in touch with registered voters who have voluntarily supplied their cell phone numbers
1268884 but well start by contacting those that have voluntarily given out that information
1268885 i have access to whos actually voted when we contact them
1268886 we can get around that by having the actual records

1268906 people seem to think this problem has disappeared or they are unaware generations have been wiped out people need to focus on the real world
1268907 the feminism of aids has ramifications for our whole society if we cease to respect the mother we cease to be human and all mankind is in jeopardy this is a ticking time bomb and it is criminal to let it continue
1268908 jacob was 7 and weighed less than a 1 year old and five months later he was almost normal weight

1268910 i am concerned how many governments have fallen short on their promises
1268911 even in areas that are highly affected african leaders made commitments and didnt come through only two of 50 african countries achieved their commitments
1268912 we should have surpassed collecting what we need so we could be spending now
1268913 they need to invest in the health care system so health care workers dont migrate because the country they are in cant pay a salary
1268914 feeling bad about yourself activates stress centres in the brain that can actually lead to disease
1268915 it will come in time when we want to do it
1268916 we both think a wedding on a beach would be very romantic when the time is right
1268917 she passed out but was able to call the ambulance herself she was losing blood and was not in a good way at the moment its a mystery they are keeping her in for tests until they can find out what the problem is
1268918 this is without doubt the most exciting digital photography announcement this year
1268919 these guidelines will prevent a blurring of the lines between the role of military and humanitarian actors preventing humanitarian space from being squeezed further recognising the distinct role that we have to play will be a vital component of protecting our impartiality and opening up humanitarian space for us
1268920 it is an important step forward in improving the coordination between military actors and humanitarian actors
1268921 we hope the guidelines will in the future avoid misunderstandings and the neutrality of humanitarian actors is better respected
1268922 oef forces are not routinely involved in development projects and therefore are not required to approve this guideline the majority of us forces are assigned to isaf nato and are in compliance with this guideline
1268923 we have no idea about these guidelines and were never part of the process which produced them we only respect truly neutral and independent aid organisations which do not work at the behest of american and western forces
1268924 government and humanitarian actors have the primary role of providing humanitarian assistance and the military is primarily responsible for providing security and if necessary basic infrastructure and urgent reconstruction assistance limited to gap filling measures until civilian organisations are able to take over
1268925 all humanitarian actors military actors and other security actors should at all times be respectful of international law and afghan laws culture and customs
1268926 humanitarian assistance must not be used for the purpose of political gain relationship building or winning hearts and minds
1268927 as all actors who have taken a proactive stance in support of the goa government of afghanistan including the un the eu european union isaf and other security forces are currently targets of armed opposition groups in afghanistan a distinction must be retained between the identities functions and roles of these entities and those actors who seek to preserve neutrality
1268928 a distinction must be retained between the identities functions and roles of the different actors to preserve our neutrality
1268929 and clearly the process has passed muster as full and fair
1268930 i dont think that anybody could argue that this was a fair trial
1268931 if the police crossed the line then normally everything after that would be considered fruit of the poisoned tree and excluded
1268932 this is a bigger more complicated and diverse set of businesses than most people think
1268933 i took two years away from advertising and became aware just how lucky i am that great creatives at good agencies ask me to do these things smashing huge amounts of coloured glass to the sound of cock rock im so in love with advertising again

1268938 although how long that will take is still unclear but a deal is not far off not at all
1268939 the president will raise a number of issues such as the permanent status issues checkpoints and prisoners
1268940 we decided and promised to make all the efforts to reach the peace treaty until the end of the year we are making all the effort to do so
1268941 but what is more important is now the understanding between israelis and the palestinians that we are on the right track the timeline is less important
1268942 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1268943 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game

1268948 everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1268949 before the attack a bad guy has a one in sixty five thousand chance of stealing your internet connection but he can only try once every couple of hours after the attack which kaminsky discovered a bad guy has a one in sixty five thousand chance of stealing your internet connection and he can try a couple thousand times a second after the patch a bad guy has a one in a couple hundred million or even a couple billion chance of stealing your internet connection he can still try to do so a couple thousand times a second but its going to make a lot of noise

1268953 i wouldnt predict gordons demise too quickly i think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the british people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day week to week
1268954 the only advice i would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics
1268955 just trust the people to at whatever time he stands for election to make a good judgement you get one of these jobs the best politics is to do the job

1268970 we cannot have the hospital downgraded in any manner or means
1268971 this is about the health board not putting in full time members of staff to provide the service that we require in a amp e
1268972 i want a reassurance that they can staff the hospital and they have got a long term commitment to the galloway hospital in stranraer
1268973 i think our record in the past has shown we want to spend money to provide health services in stranraer
1268974 staffing an a amp e department at that distance from a district general hospital is always going to be difficult
1268975 i think it is really important we get highly trained doctors who are going to provide the service
1268976 the longer people claim the more we will expect in return

1268982 and i find it hard to accept that everyone around the country has to adjust their lives and work for it just because this is about the countrys image

1269020 color is so dynamic in terms of shade hue depth and texture that any absolute statement about color is never always true for anyone

1269056 i opened my etsy shop last november and sold my first pieces a few weeks later prior to that id never shown my work publicly so it was quite a thrill to suddenly share my illustrations with people around the world as far as my credentials go i majored in art history and took many studio art classes in college and ive been a doodler and painter most of my life im still new to the business side of illustration and really excited by the possibilities
1269057 my work is inspired by classic childrens book illustrators contemporary pop surrealist artists and the natural world especially the animal kingdom which never ceases to amaze and delight me
1269058 you might be surprised to learn that im a bit of a cynic and a pessimist by nature but i like to think that my better side shows through in my work i figure that theres enough ugliness angst and sorrow in the world already so i choose to celebrate the sweetness instead in response to what i hope to give the world through my art im afraid that i dont really have any lofty intentions when im going about my day and i see something cute it gives me a momentary little burst of happiness id love to think that my illustrations occasionally have that effect on people
1269059 i am lucky to have a really sweet and supportive husband seriously my work would not be possible without him not only does he pay the bills thanks sweetie but he offers lots of encouragement during the slow spells also i try to remember that although times are certainly tough financially we are living in something of a golden age for indie artists musicians and crafters the internet has given us so much power and control over our careers its truly amazing ten years ago i wouldnt have imagined that id be selling my art to customers as far away as australia its a real honor and something that im grateful for every day
1269060 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
1269061 i believed i have concluded it by a legitimate induction but at the same time i havent been able to find a demonstration
1269062 if you tell me you know that a statement is true and then in fact someone later proves it i cant show mathematically that you didnt know it all along
1269063 a mathematical statement is true whether we know it or not
1269064 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
1269065 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games they must release all imprisoned peaceful activists allow foreign and national journalists to report freely and make further progress towards the elimination of the death penalty
1269066 we welcome the iocs recognition of its role on human rights but given the current reality we are surprised at their confidence that foreign media will be able to report freely and that there will be no internet censorship
1269067 and they must speak out when the authorities violate the wider olympic principles
1269068 additionally world leaders who attend the games need to raise their voice publicly for human rights in china and in support of individual chinese human rights activists
1269069 this is a stab in the back of chinese dissidents this is truly cowardly and is the opposite of what one expects from france
1269070 while some correspondents have noted improvements brought about by the new regulations the majority say the regulations have done little to enable them to report on issues that government officials are determined to conceal
1269071 those include high level corruption ethnic conflicts social unrest public health crises and the working of chinas large detention system including prisons labour camps mental institutions and police stations
1269072 its in the interest of the ioc and the foreign heads of state who will attend the beijing olympics to try to ensure that media freedom is a lasting legacy of the games rather than a broken promise
1269073 the chinese authorities have broken the promises they made when they were granted the olympics seven years ago
1269074 they told the world that the olympics would help bring human rights to china but the government continues to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights ahead of the games
1269075 the olympic values have been betrayed by the chinese government they must release all imprisoned peaceful activists allow foreign and national journalists to report freely and make further progress towards the elimination of the death penalty or risk permanently sullying the legacy of the olympics
1269076 world leaders attending the games even if its only the closing ceremony should send an unequivocal message that they support human rights for the chinese people
1269077 they should highlight the cases of individual chinese human rights activists who have been silenced by the authorities a failure to do so will give the impression that it is acceptable for a government to host the olympic games in an atmosphere of repression and persecution
1269078 we want china to live up to its promise of complete media freedom and allow full access to foreign journalists who are reporting in china
1269079 we want them to release all the journalists chinese journalists whove been imprisoned in violation of their human rights and also to stop its censorship of the domestic media particularly the internet
1269080 my father was a banker and my mother had descended from a family of well to do landlords
1269081 my youth was one of peace and pleasure then in 1949 came the communist revolution led by mao my life changed dramatically during my teen age years my father lost all his properties we had money problems the government took over all the property in the country we even had to sell my piano
1269082 at first things seemed ok in china the government was busy with the korean war and suppressing the old government elements the first four to five years after the revolution we were basically ok as a nation but then the government began to wipe out religion buddhists catholics and all christians
1269083 the majority of the chinese people wanted to dedicate their efforts toward serving the people of the nation we believed this would make china a wealthy nation
1269084 the communist government told the people there will be no more imperialism no more colonialism
1269085 there had been many problems in china since the japanese invasion we believed at first that the new communist government would be clean and straight and honest we wanted to work hard and discipline ourselves for the good of the next generation we believed in the future of communism and mao was treated as a god
1269086 when i was 18 i went to beijing to begin studies at the beijing college of geology at that time i realized that my parents were at the top of society a banker and the daughter of a landlord i began to question myself and say do i deserve this when so many are so poor i thought that maybe the communist revolution would be good for the whole country
1269087 it was only when i went to china in 1954 55 that i actually studied marxist thought once i understood marxism i even expressed my wish to become a communist party member marxism talked about self reliance without depending on a creator or a god that was very attractive i still think that if a genuine communist movement had come to tibet there would have been much benefit to the people
1269088 when i was 20 i was a sophomore and majoring in geology and engineering i played shortstop on the baseball team and was the captain i had a girlfriend too
1269089 in 1957 came something called the 100 flower movement the communists named it as such because all chinese were supposed to blossom no matter what their views were the communist party invited me to a meeting where i was encouraged to speak my mind actually i didnt have much to say
1269090 well first of all i said i think the communist party has to correct their privileged status the common chinese have second and third class status under them then i said secondly that the 1956 soviet invasion of hungary is a violation of international law at that time the peoples republic of china was a supporter of the soviet union
1269091 then two weeks later we had another meeting with the communist party branch at my university
1269092 the cp communist party leaders idea was we have to let the snake anti communists come out then we will destroy them they said that even though i had not committed a bad crime i erred by not admitting the crime i had resisted it therefore i was to receive a certain kind of punishment
1269093 i had 24 hour surveillance put on me every week i had to write a self examination paper and a confession my parents girlfriend and friends had to denounce me publicly i felt that my future and freedom was gone people feel i am a criminal nobody sympathized with me i was one of the 550 000 purged during the 100 flowers movement the actual figure of those purged is closer to 1 million
1269094 at that time i still believed in communism and that it would do good for the country
1269095 of course there was no trial court or paperwork i was sent to a slave labor camp the first night in the camp they told me that i had been sentenced to life imprisonment i was bourgeois stubborn and had resisted i was sentenced to a life of re education on april 27 1960 i was only 23 years of age
1269096 we worked seven days per week and 30 days per month
1269097 at first i worked in a chemical factory in beijing
1269098 i realized that i cannot resist them i am no longer a human being when you think of being a human being what do you think of anthony you think of freedom your future dignity sex business children i was sentenced for life in the slave labor camps there was no freedom for thinking how can you fight for those things in the beginning the first two years in the slave labor camp i tried my best to say to myself i am innocent but you had to give up your political beliefs and your faith or you would get tortured so you pretend you work hard and obey or there would be big trouble for you
1269099 i had been baptized as a catholic when i was 12 years old
1269100 ideals like love and kindness you dont think about these things inside the laogai food was a major problem the prison guards told us you will get good food for good behavior but we did not we never had any eggs maybe some pork scraps once per month we ate corn soybeans and vegetable soup everyone in the laogai system wanted to steal food all of the slave laborers became animals you can take the very best men in the world and if you put them in the laogai after a time they will all become beasts
1269101 i lost weight my lowest weight was 36 kilograms about 80 pounds i almost died i was like a skeleton my skin was thin the bones were light
1269102 yes i would have been able to escape but i thought where would i go to my parents house if i went there they would have to turn me in or they themselves would be sent to a slave labor camp there would be no food for me and no money under the communist regime all food is controlled each chinese citizen would get monthly food coupons with strict registration procedures that were enforced there were no restaurants where i could go and eat
1269103 when mao died the communist government was in a crisis
1269104 the communist party then decided that it would release the old counter revolutionaries i was among them but sadly many others had returned to ashes the purpose of these releases was to reduce tension people at that time in china had no money or food so the government realized they must pull back a little and release some prisoners
1269105 communist ideology takes away the land banks factories and farms there is no means of production that is privately owned north korea the soviet union and her allies and china remained communist through 1979 china had been communist since 1949 deng xiou ping said that the cp would allow foreign companies to come back to china had he given up the communist revolution no the cp still had the same constitution as i said deng felt if we want to remain in the center of power we need money and food to stop demonstrations by the citizens of china black or white we are still a cat
1269106 i had spent all of my 20s and 30s in the camps i had not had any access to movies food music a girlfriend family or a library
1269107 after i was released i got a job at a university but the party members there reminded me you are free but you have a big tail wrap it between your legs i realized that i am not free i was the head of the laboratory and later became a lecturer at china geoscience university i was at that university for six years between 1979 and 1985
1269108 i was quiet studied hard and never complained about anything i even received two awards i never ever spoke of politics
1269109 then i was granted the opportunity to go to the university of california at berkeley as a visiting scholar in the civil engineering department
1269110 you see freedom is priceless i had it then lost it then i finally got it back you cannot understand what it means to have freedom unless you have lost it freedom is quite simple you can say what you want and go where you want to go
1269111 when i arrived in america i only had 40 in my pocket uc berkeley officials had said to me to wait one more year and then come over to america but i could not wait any longer i had no money so i had to sleep at the bus station and on a bench in the park finally i found out that i could sleep on the sofa in the library of the university i could actually take a nap there with the newspaper folded over my face it was so comfortable
1269112 remember i had spent 20 years in slave labor camps and mines but i could not work i had no work permit so i taught at berkeley while at the same time living as a homeless person and sleeping on the streets
1269113 after four months of working i had saved 1 025
1269114 wanted to turn the page and look forward i didnt want to talk about my experiences in the laogai there was no congressional testimony no mass media but then in 1989 came tiananmen square americans were shocked but i was not shocked or surprised
1269115 i wanted at that time to have a family a house a good woman at my age then the road ahead of me was less than the road i had passed over so i didnt say or do anything politically then in 1990 sen alan cranston d calif and sen jesse helms r n c invited me to testify before the senate on the laogai
1269116 by 1992 i was again on the wanted or black list in communist china
1269117 i spoke at the united nations human rights commission in geneva i spoke to the british and australian parliaments
1269118 what happened in moscow will soon happen in beijing communism is an unreasonable system in the 1960s the west had social problems and many communists believed communism would still succeed in eastern europe the communists tried new policies but without success even today communism remains the same basic system
1269119 clinton is on the wrong side of history he is a smart guy but too concerned for his own benefit and the american business community clinton knew he must help the business community in exchange for political donations
1269120 take sandy berger for example before he worked in the white house do you know what he did he worked at a law firm that was hired by the chinese as lobbyists could an american lawyer working as a lobbyist for the soviets get a job in the white house in 1992 clinton spoke to the national geographic society he said we want to see a prosperous and peaceful and stable china what does he mean by stable cuba the soviet union north korea and the soviet bloc iraq we dont want to use the word stable in relation to these states america didnt and doesnt want them stable there is chaos and starvation in some of these places clinton meant that he wanted a stable investment climate in china for american businesses under the communist system the government controls labor and resources if chaos would result the western investors would lose their money they have invested in communist china
1269121 in regard to wen ho lee i think the facts will eventually come out from beijing to tell the truth because the communist system is collapsing the government in china has planned to get americas nuclear and defense secrets they have that idea and they have the people to do it my personal opinion is that wen ho lee did it the espionage against america i dont have evidence according to logic i believe he did
1269122 communism is not dead and please dont tell me iraq was a successful operation america has many allies in that region saudi arabia turkey kuwait israel they can use germanys airbases they talk about handling two regional conflicts at the same time lets say iraq and north korea but they never speak about asia they dont know how to handle it korea and vietnam were americas biggest wars since world war ii
1269123 this incident tells you that you cannot turn a blind eye to china
1269124 without the support of communist china north korea would collapse right away even now there are 200 000 north korean refugees in manchuria
1269125 when he became president of south africa he abandoned taiwan and recognized china instead taiwan and anti communist apartheid south africa had been close allies mandela has extensive human rights knowledge he may not be a communist but the new leader of south africa thabo mbeki is definitely a communist recently he went to cuba to meet with castro and he was trained in moscow
1269126 in september of 1999 i went to vladivostock russia to the headquarters of the russian pacific fleet i saw rows of nuclear subs and missile destroyers tied up on the docks this is good right the russians fleet is tied up and rusting away but communist china bought two of these destroyers and spent 2 billion on them they were designed in the 1980s to attack the u s aircraft carriers now china has them in her naval arsenal
1269127 congress gave me nice support sens helms and paul wellstone of minnesota when i met sen wellstone he said harry i dont need a brief just tell me what you want me to do but they were only some of the senators others took a stand for communist china based on family or business interests for example sen diane feinstein d calif her husband is a board member of cosco the plas chinese overseas shipping corporation and he has other investments in china you see this is the kind of person feinstein who is never interested in my work
1269128 the leaders in america will say china has only 18 icbms and we have thousands
1269129 when clinton came back from china in 1998 he was like chamberlain returning from munich before world war ii clinton said we reached an agreement with china not to target each others cities with icbms i say do we need such an agreement with india or the uk china doesnt want america to have a missile defense because it would make their offensive system lousy they dont want america to share the system with taiwan

1269133 youre not going to actually write down what i say are you please promise me one thing that you wont keep track of how many f bombs i drop
1269134 the working title of this seminar is a meditation on the importance of terroir which is to say that were only going to be talking about the meaning of terroir really under no circumstances will this be a demonstration or a proof of terroir i will never do that sort of tasting again
1269135 its essentially been proven and continues to be proven vintage after vintage after vintage let me tell you a little story to explain where im coming from and then we can move on when i got into wine i was studying in germany at the time and wine wasnt uncool yet there i got into exploring the wine regions that were close to me and started learning both from experience and from the way people thought about wine there that the flavors in riesling came from the soils that the vines grew in that was simply part of my understanding of how wine worked
1269136 it came as a great shock to me when i first learned that some people believed to the contrary
1269137 indeed terroir has become something you need to fight for and this fight has frankly become tiring there are two types of people out there there are those who understand that the soil makes the wine and then there are those who are idiots so lets move on
1269138 heres my definition of terroir terroir for the purposes of this and other discussions is a cause and effect relationship between soil components and wine flavors for which no other explanation seems possible thats it
1269139 obviously there are things that act upon terroir geologic structure drainage the soils warming properties the ph of the soil et cetera weather acts upon terroir and of course humans act upon terroir
1269140 saying weather acts upon terroir is like saying some years elvis was skinny some years elvis was fat elvis was still elvis the components are there and they are creating the flavors modified by everything that happens to the grapes in that vintage including our own actions but the components are there
1269141 of course theres no way of proving that scientifically we havent figured out how yet but its true truth to me means that all ravens are black until you see a white raven if i see evidence that contradicts my hypothesis i will change my opinion im still waiting for a white raven
1269142 when all other variables are removed we see that one type of soil creates this flavor and other soils create that flavor and riesling is perfect for this of course because the variables involved in the winemaking are so few
1269143 we should probably talk a bit about minerality for a minute terroir is not flavors of minerality in wine terroir can produce many flavors in wine certain fruit flavors floral nuances and yes sometimes the flavors that many people describe as minerality
1269144 when we speak about minerality though we are not actually speaking about minerality what seems to us tasters as flavors or aromas of wet stones crushed rocks or minerals are almost certainly not that but that sense of minerality arises for lots of tasters nonetheless we call it minerality because that metaphor is useful but lets get one thing straight were not talking about the literal translation of minerals from the soil through the roots into the grapes and manifested as flavors of that mineral in the final wine in the fullness of time such a direct correlation may be proven but we will have to wait and see
1269145 so why do we need to talk about terroir at all sometimes i dont think we do i certainly get tired of it it is not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow heres what i think terroir is simply a portal through which we can pass and experience a world of humane civilized and reasonable values think about that for a while life is better because of terroir
1269146 i like to say that the text of what the wines say is in the ground
1269147 winemaking is the preservation of flavor that is already there i like to say that grand cru vineyards are the earths erogenous zones they are special places that tingle when sunlight hits them

1269220 i have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world
1269221 people have spent their lives working for govt and all they get is mere 10k 20k whereas ppl employeed in pvt sector with similar qualification and work load get double of that
1269222 why dont you keep your room clean like your sister
1269223 it may be time to redefine the meaning of being grown up if we continue to apply the same standards used to identify the transition from childhood to adulthood among baby boomers we may discover that generation x will never grow up
1269224 what are you afraid cant you breathe fag why dont you say something
1269225 you dirty worthless pig go ahead say something lets hear your sweet little voice gayboy you little girl you little fag wheres your boyfriend why do you only hang out with girls huh you know im going to tell your mommy that i saw you kissing steven then what shell believe me and then shell send you away thats what she doesnt want a dirty little homosexual in her house im surprised she hasnt kicked you out already i would have youre so small i wouldve thrown you out a long time ago for being defective jacobs a little defective faggot
1269226 you are the one afraid now now it shows i can see how much of a coward you are you always were
1269227 every day like the cowardly worm you are you teased him you made fun of him you hit him you threw his books on the floor you tore him apart why tell me andrew what did he ever do to you
1269228 never once did he ever say a bad word about you did you know that for years you made his ride home from school hell he had bruises up and down his arms because of you how it ever got that bad i dont know still he never said one bad word about you so what in heavens name ever gave you the right to make someone with such a good heart hurt so bad
1269229 its obvious now who the real coward was you hurt him andrew you hurt him bad but never once did you hear a sound from him he was strong andrew stronger than you will ever be
1269230 you killed him because you were scared and you knew he would never fight back such an easy target huh
1269231 he had the biggest heart you will every find in a human being andrew he was the better person you just couldnt stand it could you and now hes gone whatd you do with him andrew
1269232 i run a 103 fever for a little more than a week i had the chills i shook so hard it was kinda scary i had the sweats like you wouldnt believe i lost 15 pounds in nine days so that gives you an idea i was flat on my back in bed for two weeks
1269233 i dont have a lot of strength yet my legs are like walking on jelly i really feel good by noon i might slip out and take a nap to recuperate and go again

1269273 but once tried i dont know that it offered a particularly fantastic or unique experience that wasnt offered by other chains
1269274 firstly its the product and the taste and secondly the place and the service
1269275 its much easier for the local store to differentiate itself as being local whereas starbucks had this slightly schizophrenic positioning where it wanted to be the global local store
1269276 the american seattle based coffee of starbucks was never going to resonate and penetrate australias very big coffee drinking community
1269277 theres no question starbucks in many ways is an admirable company
1269278 starbucks has done very well in international markets where there has not traditionally been a coffee drinking culture
1269279 starbucks is one of the nicest coffees that ive tried
1269280 its a stronger taste which i like its a unique experience and its renowned for being good which is why people love it

1269318 what im really happy about is that by taking the mummy out of egypt and putting it in china by exploring a different approach to the quest for immortality we now have it clear that the mummy franchise can travel
1269319 now we know that if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because theres a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures
1269320 they have a lot of mummies the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found

1269353 we have previously demonstrated that fullerene based molecular resists are capable of very high resolution lithographic patterning with electron beam lithography
1269354 furthermore by virtue of the high carbon content of the fullerene materials these resists are extremely resistant to the plasma etching procedure used to transfer resist patterns into the semiconductor which allows us to use very thin films of the resist when patterning feature sizes less than 100 nm in width the surface tension of the solvent used to develop the resist pattern can cause closely spaced features to collapse if the film thickness is more than three times the feature size and hence the ability to use thinner films is beneficial
1269355 while we previously have demonstrated very high resolution with poor sensitivity in pure fullerene based resists or alternatively good sensitivity but mediocre resolution in chemically amplified fullerene resists this is the first time that we have managed to combine both properties into a single material
1269356 is that it is possible to apply the well known photoresist sensitivity enhancement technique of chemical amplification to high resolution fullerene based molecular resists without a degradation of the existing resolution and line width roughness and whilst retaining a useful etch resistance
1269357 we believe that this material has the best combination of resolution line width roughness and sensitivity currently available
1269358 it also retains good etch durability comparable with high durability commercial resists and shows lwr values approaching those specified by the itrs
1269359 we are currently investigating the response of this materials using extreme ultraviolet lithography and are also keen to investigate the use of our materials in current photolithography exposure tools additionally we are looking into ways in which we can replace the halogenated solvents currently used for our molecular resists with more environmental friendly solvents

1269409 this is an intriguing contribution to efforts aimed at identifying the molecular bases of alcohol tolerance
1269410 this represents a novel and elegant mechanism by which neurons are able to adapt to alcohol
1269411 moreover since adaptation or tolerance to the drug likely contributes to alcohol abuse our findings identify a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention
1269412 this study demonstrates for the first time that alcohol exposure can cause rapid changes in microrna levels altering gene expression and perhaps behavior
1269413 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
1269414 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
1269415 we tried to overcome the limits of previous studies done by others those studies may have overestimated the benefits of the flu vaccine in the elderly for various reasons
1269416 they are less likely than younger healthier seniors to go out and get vaccinated and more apt to develop pneumonia
1269417 thats why our study used a control time period after flu vaccine became available but before each flu season actually started
1269418 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
1269419 this is a very efficient solution to a very difficult problem i believe that this device has great clinical potential

1269426 m y original thesis podcasting is failing as a business platform and has failed to make a mainstream impact but even if the stars had stuck around to the end and the management and board problems were addressed earlier i have to wonder how well this venture would have done this was a hyped business built on one of the most hyped technologies of 2005 once the that faded reality set in as i pointed out in my original post there are a lot of factors that are working against podcasting making programs is a labor intensive process requiring special skills in addition there is no adsense or adwords equivalents for podcasts advertising has to be sold produced and placed by humans
1269427 every incident has to be seen within its proper framework you study an incident as an incident
1269428 an incident is an incident and a crime is a crime
1269429 it is as if there is a struggle each against the other and it creates a sectarian atmosphere
1269430 this tense atmosphere makes people ready to explode at any point if they are subjected to any amount of instigation or incitement
1269431 muslims cant say it but its clear they dont accept us here no one can speak the truth on this issue so everybodys feelings are kept inside
1269432 when something happens it always comes back to muslim and christian
1269433 if someone cant resolve it they go to the police station
1269434 we feel pressure maybe not all the time but we do
1269435 we have liberty of speech and religion but its as if somebody was telling us at the same time dont speak and dont practice your religion
1269436 me i try to keep a certain distance from muslims
1269437 we have simple relations i give you this you give me this thats it they dont want more than that either
1269438 only content to send security forces after clashes catch fire
1269439 the religious discourse has to change from both sides because it incites hatred even if it does so indirectly increasing fanaticism from both sides
1269440 education is about preparing students for the future and it is important that the university reflects the diverse cultures of the global community in which these students must find their path
1269441 we will continue our efforts to recruit and retain more women and more persons of color
1269442 when you recruit well you are much more likely to have a national pool that includes women and minorities
1269443 and i am proud of the efforts the university has made to strengthen its recruiting efforts
1269444 nebraska is known as a great place to recruit young faculty
1269445 we looked for specific genetic biomarkers for multiple myeloma to see if there were any common dna changes that were specific to the family chosen for the study
1269446 what we found is that there are inherited genes that exist in some families which predispose them to an increased risk for multiple myeloma and certain other cancers
1269447 we also reviewed the usefulness of certain biomarkers for early diagnosis of multiple myeloma which will also hopefully provide more information to help improve treatment of this deadly disease

1269449 when we all go together as christians on those things we feel like were one were secure and were able to relax
1269450 honestly i dont understand how it has come to this
1269451 they didnt used to sit to one side like this they used to mingle now their lives are all centered around the church
1269452 i get the feeling they dont want me to be part of their life i get the feeling they are being told to be like this
1269453 is it a land dispute when they kidnap monks and torture them
1269454 is it a land dispute when they tell you to spit on the cross when they try to make you say the words to convert to islam
1269455 theres not much wrong with a 20 year old man having sex with a 15 year old man
1269456 failed to get upset that other celebrities have got away with it
1269457 exploit ed the 14 15 year old victims lack of capacity for sexual self determination
1269458 well if youre not targetting then i didnt mean you
1269459 men who take advantage of youngsters in their mid teens purely to get their sexual kicks
1269460 so your decision to develop such a strong opinion means this is in some way threatening to you

1269465 thats the crux of the omaha cares initiative communicating vigilance tips to everyone who might need help and to those who are available to help in emergencies
1269466 the tips that are provided are easy to implement and just make good sense
1269467 i would encourage all employees at unmc the nebraska medical center and unmc physicians to get involved in this program it could truly make a difference
1269468 we have always believed that strong neighborhoods are the glue that holds this community together
1269469 the omaha cares initiative will surely improve safety and could reduce or eliminate unfortunate incidents such as those that have occurred in recent months
1269470 the tips that are provided are easy to implement and just make good sense
1269471 we need to do more for people who are at risk for personal health and safety related issues
1269472 and plans should be in place for others who face sudden emergencies we can do our share beginning at the neighborhood level but there is a role for the corporate and faith communities and others
1269473 the involvement of caring citizens can eliminate minutes and even hours from the emergency response process
1269474 no you may not jump off the back of the couch eat five cookies before dinner or otherwise paint the cat blue etc
1269475 blogging citizen journalism social networks etc what alternative media exists in lebanon and what benefit can it provide

1269481 the group eyed me a bit suspiciously when i introduced myself and one of them tony masal asked me for my credentials
1269482 and a lot of women get abandoned here they get left behind with no way of getting home so were here to help

1269485 wow not even a pity f from a drunk fat whore
1269486 the center is definitely for the general public as well as aleppo jews
1269487 the jewish people are composed of different parts each one together makes a beautiful picture we want to show our part here the jewish community of aleppo is ancient it dates from biblical times from the time of king david throughout our history the aleppo community has had many rich traditions that we want to show and share with all of the jewish people
1269488 aristocratic and noble the crown of splendor in the sephardi world
1269489 it is a hoary aleppo legend both jewish and muslim that the patriarch abraham had settled for a period in aleppo in his wanderings from his native ur
1269490 every place else the spanish and portuguese jews went they held onto their customs to their spanish and to their portuguese and to their ladino in aleppo they threw all that away and became like the older community the mustaarabim with everyone speaking arabic
1269491 the real irony here is that the maximum number of jews in aleppo throughout our history there was maybe maybe 20 000 certainly no more than that
1269492 and now today there are hundreds of thousands of aleppo jews all over the world in new york alone there are maybe 100 000 there are more aleppo jews just living in brooklyn than there ever were in aleppo
1269493 we aleppo jews have lost our homeland all of us are now in diaspora
1269494 the aleppo people are really proud of their communities very proud
1269495 theres a huge difference between aleppo and damascus jews different language different customs and if they live in a small aleppo community like hong kong or kobe japan if they cant find an aleppo person to marry they go looking in other aleppo communities around the world
1269496 you may see someone living here but his brother lives in buenos aires and his sister lives in geneva
1269497 the syrian government is maintaining all of these places they are not in the best condition but the government is protecting them even all of the holy books from vandalism and theft the big synagogue has even been renovated somewhat thanks to money sent by the aleppo jewish community in brooklyn
1269498 two or three years ago the leadership of the brooklyn aleppo community went to aleppo they visited president bashar assad who welcomed them in his palace it was all official he invited them he welcomed them they were photographed together smiling
1269499 there is a good warm relationship between the community and president assad and his government unfortunately i dont think that the israeli government has used this connection at all the aleppo community in brooklyn is very powerful i think that if our government used this connection the right way it could go a long way toward the goal of bringing peace between syria and israel but i think that the political leadership here is mostly interested in the aleppo jews money and not anything more
1269500 you want to know why ill tell you there are two secrets
1269501 one is our unity we can go all over the world and not only find aleppo jews but aleppo jews that we are related to through blood or marriage were more than a community were a worldwide family but the most important secret its the maaser the tithe
1269502 aleppo jews are observant and jewish law demands that we make the tithe aleppo jews are strict about contributing the proper amounts of money to charity and that is our real business secret
1269503 were dealing with the matters raised in those letters were hoping to have them sorted out in the next week or so
1269504 council will let us know what the key issues rising from the public submissions are thats process
1269505 the fact that she pre booked the taxi and that the crime was committed in the environs of the sprawling new delhi airport was for me a warning
1269506 dawn was committed to the spirit of life long learning
1269507 she had a profound impact on people seeking a spiritual path
1269508 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
1269509 decades long campaign to stamp out the bahai community in iran
1269510 these are the types of charges that have been leveled against the bahai community in iran since the 1979 islamic revolution
1269511 even before the revolution the bahai community in iran was accused of being spies for the british or the russians it really comes down to the fact that they are being targeted because of their religious beliefs
1269512 we havent seen bahais released in the past nor have we seen due process with regard to bahais or other religious minorities in iran
1269513 its been steadily worsening over the past few years and we are deeply concerned about the welfare of these people
1269514 there is a steady drumbeat against the bahai in iran
1269515 the bahai teachings of the oneness of humanity and acceptance of others just shows that what is taking place in iran is irrational and based in islamic fundamentalism
1269516 due to the calculated effort made by iranian intelligence officials the people who caused this blast were arrested quickly and admitted their connection to the zionist regime america and england
1269517 we are wanting to sell our house but do not know how much money we should invest in our home and what we should upgrade to get our house sold for more
1269518 we love to play a game of football we like to play a game of league
1269519 we are the ghosts we are the ghosts you cant see us
1269520 about 7pm the bus pulled up in front of the ses office
1269521 the team members alighted at least a dozen of them and proceeded to move into the ses area around the buildings and started urinating instead of walking across the road and using the toilet block that was open
1269522 my dog started barking and i went to the front room and told them to shut up
1269523 they started singing we are the ghosts we are the ghosts
1269524 id say they were saying that to put the blame on the ghosts
1269525 urinating in a public place in a residential area is a filthy attitude
1269526 weve spent a lot of time this year trying to dispel the boofhead image of football
1269527 it was a dangerous road i think its better they didnt cross the road with the amount of traffic that was coming through woodburn
1269528 i asked the bus driver to drive across to the toilet but he said he couldnt go across the double yellow lines
1269529 im not denying that they got out and had a leak most of the ones i saw were facing the bus and urinating on the grass beside the bus there mightve been a couple that turned away
1269530 it would be the last thing our guys would think of is to try and denigrate the ses
1269531 its not a heinous offence no one was flashing i dont think their behaviour was untoward
1269532 they didnt even realise the ses building was behind them they were all discrete in what they did
1269533 blokes will be blokes and most of the blokes stood at the bus wheel which youre quite legally entitled to do
1269534 i dont know where he got that from i didnt see anybody talk to him it was all over in a matter of minutes
1269535 he probably doesnt even know who the ghosts are i suppose they just thought theyd be smart its a pretty stupid thing to say when the ghosts were playing in grafton
1269536 ive been in football a long time ive done the trips and you never pull up in a residential area there are plenty of places away from houses where they couldve stopped
1269537 i wouldve said to the bus driver lets go through woodburn and pull up at the truckstop a few kilometres out of town ghost ship crew not ready for voyage the skipper of north queenslands infamous ghost ship
1269538 this is my first birthday present these guys gave me the best present
1269539 they are perfectly the same as their daddy i am in heaven here i am a happy person
1269540 on the one hand it is so unexpected to find such a fragile bulla in such harsh conditions of excavation while on the other hand it was logical to find precisely here the bulla of gedalyahu ben pashur only meters away from the place where we found the bulla of yehukhal ben shelemyahu since these two ministers are mentioned side by side in the bible as having served together in the kingdom of king zedekiah
1269541 it is not very often that such a discovery happens in which real figures of the past shake off the dust of history and so vividly revive the stories of the bible

1269547 the structure of a language constrains the thinking of people using that language
1269548 if you just take one plant type like sugarcane weve analysed a huge variety of sugarcane species or cultivars that every farmer around here would grow what weve found is that they vary by about 500 per cent in their ability to trap carbon inside the silica
1269549 what jeff and i have done is show that if you select the variety that does this at the highest rate you could securely lock away up to half a tonne of co2 per hectare every year just by making that one little decision
1269550 the silica is just like quartz its not quite as stable but its pretty close because its the same element
1269551 plants are already doing it this is a totally natural process
1269552 what weve realised is that different plants do this at different rates
1269553 so all of a sudden weve got management options that were not available before we knew this
1269554 if you revegetate it with some species theyll produce bugger all carbon storage

1269590 you have so much destruction every year its as certain as the laws of gravity every year we have destruction that can costs p15 billion and every year thats the average destruction in school buildings houses its a vicious cycle the government spends money for rehabilitation and when they rehab they build same structures but if you make the structure disaster proof theres less money spent for rehabilitation and if you transfer the risk from government to another organization you save we insure our structures so when its destroyed the government will not pay for the rehabilitation and construction
1269591 whenever you establish a settlement or business you must take into consideration many of these hazards as long as you do risk reduction measures like risk transfer or insurance then losses during a disaster might be transferred to the insurers
1269592 in a catastrophe pool all municipalities should participate so the premiums can be cheaper its cheaper to pool the assets located in scattered areas the risks go down so does the premium for as long as the area is dense we reinsure them with private insurance companies in the philippines like the swiss reinsurance company and munich reinsurance two top reinsurance companies in the world

1269683 era algo impensable para m cuando empec mi carrera en 1979 todav a jugaba en camer n y en aquella poca el f tbol africano no estaba en absoluto mediatizado fue en 1982 en espa a durante el mundial cuando se fijaron en mis actuaciones ese torneo tuvo un gran impacto en mi trayectoria
1269684 fue algo que me marc no tanto en el aspecto personal sino porque esa decepci n fren la progresi n del club que estaba en plena fase ascendente
1269685 en aquel partido realic una de mis mejores paradas estaba adelantado en el punto penal y el atacante me hizo un sombrero con un manotazo desvi la pelota contra el travesa o y la recuper dando una voltereta hacia delante
1269686 voy a sacarme el t tulo as podr tener otras posibilidades

1269690 our thing at the moment is that some family members will be going to pakistan hoping to meet up with the expedition leader of gers team wilco van rooijen
1269691 the family are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back

1269694 im very happy with the pictures they are glamorous but theyre just as i visualised them
1269695 i dont want to go down the glamour girl route
1269696 its not a big step up from underwear and bikini shoots which lots of girls do everyday
1269697 as much as i love modelling its not a career with longevity
1269698 thats why im going into tv presenting i love communicating an idea to an audience
1269699 en m me temps a va cest quun clip quoi une pendule tu ne vas pas nous en pondre
1269700 estamos muy bien listos con la cabeza totalmente enfocada en el inicio de la eliminatoria sobre todo despu s de lo que pas hace cuatro a os en donde nos quedamos a un solo partido del cuarto lugar que nos hubiera permitido llegar a un repechaje
1269701 es la primera vez que una selecci n guatemalteca llegaba a esta instancia al ltimo partido eso fue ya un gran logro obviamente fue dif cil perder pero nunca hab amos tenido esa experiencia as que la idea ahora es aprovecharla para lograr dar el paso definitivo
1269702 adem s mantenemos al mismo cuerpo t cnico que conoce el rea y mucha m s experiencia a diferencia de lo que nos sucedi en eliminatoria pasada
1269703 como hemos dicho guatemala no es favorito tenemos que jugar esos partidos como si fueran finales el primero es contra estados unidos y eso va a fijar los par metros con los que se jugar la eliminatoria
1269704 tenemos futbolistas que son t cnicamente bien dotados tambi n los hay r pidos otros con buen f sico depende de quienes est n en la cancha y el rival en turno c mo se va a jugar desde siempre hemos tenido mucha t cnica ahora tenemos que buscar un plus para ser m s efectivos
1269705 definitivamente porque la liga guatemalteca no est a nivel internacional y cuando juegas en la selecci n se siente la diferencia este torneo debe ser una vitrina como me sucedi m debut con la selecci n marqu varios goles y se me abrieron las puertas para jugar afuera
1269706 tengo m s madurez veo el f tbol de otra forma el hecho de estar afuera de guatemala te hace tener mucha m s personalidad ser m s profesional
1269707 tengo una vida c moda en estados unidos y a mi edad eso es muy importante tendr a que llegar una oferta de similares condiciones para que la considere cosa que hasta ahora no ha pasado
1269708 no creo que despu s de esta eliminatoria siga en la selecci n lo que quiero es lograr el sue o de los aficionados espero que esta sea la oportunidad que todos estamos esperando para calificar y as retirarme de la selecci n haciendo historia
1269709 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
1269710 im proud of him because politics is dirty especially with republicans
1269711 this record felt like and still feels like from the writing to the recording a reclaiming of my own independence
1269712 you begin to get yourself hung up on other peoples expectations and i dont think i do my best work when i think about what other people might think of the work im doing when you do that i think the process is robbed of its freedom a little bit so i kind of found my way to an independent streak on this record i was making the songs for the songs themselves and for me alone i never played them for anyone else and i didnt obsess about them too much id write a song and move on so theres a truthful feeling to the album
1269713 when i make a record i finish it and i sit with it for a little while and inevitably ill write a couple more songs and its happened just about every time those other songs really shape the record and almost every time theyve had the title track of the record
1269714 to me its a rock record in the vein of people that ive always loved like weezer or the pixies but i guess those bands have great pop sensibilities but to me i view them as rock bands
1269715 if rock is popular at the time it becomes pop and i embrace pop music but it doesnt sound poppier to me so i just dont know if it is or it isnt ill take it if it is though because i think people enjoy that
1269716 hes a fine producer in his own right and id never worked with a producer who had written their own songs and had success with them
1269717 so i thought that that gave him a unique perspective on what i was doing and i thought he might work as a good sounding board for the songs ive got he taught me a lot because he has a great sense of melody
1269718 im writing about the journey i have been on and my life has taken me in some weird directions
1269719 some have been great some have been hard and i looked to those things and to the people that surround me and have drawn stories out of those experiences thats the one thing when you write about what you know as long as you keep living your life you dont run out of creative impetus
1269720 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1269721 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1269722 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1269723 mr oberst im afraid well need to do a root canal
1269724 saw an eagle on a pole i think it was an eagle
1269725 if i go to heaven ill be bored as hell
1269726 we are not going to comment on whether there is a criminal investigation
1269727 thats the beauty i think of writing vague but powerful lyrics that someone like a movie director can interpret it in his own way and obviously someone creative is able to take the metaphors and apply them to whatever he needs in his own life
1269728 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1269729 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1269730 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular
1269731 metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1269732 its a story about human beings who dont know each other in a particularly tense situation
1269733 it could be a contemporary war setting but its really about forgiveness and redemption and understanding what goes on in peoples minds we really feel that this was such a beautiful and epic way to treat the song in something that was really radically different than the specificity of the lyrics
1269734 the war is crazy right now my aunties over there so wed love to see them come back real soon
1269735 can my vote count for two or something since im a celebrity
1269736 he was like im the most hated on so he wanted to do a mixtape with me kind of like the two most hated on or something like that
1269737 everybody is always picking on us anyway we might just go head and kill the game and sh on all these n as do a mixtape album together put it out and go hard
1269738 yo can i take it back to where it all started
1269739 it was hard for me to perform the first song because when i see 100 000 people singing along theres only one person i could think of whos missing tonight

1269800 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
1269801 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
1269802 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
1269803 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
1269804 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
1269805 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita
1269806 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
1269807 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
1269808 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
1269809 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
1269810 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora
1269811 i tuoi post sono molto belli e fatti con amore complimenti
1269812 credo che il tuo blog sia sempre stato uno dei pi interessanti
1269813 leggo spesso il tuo blog sono una tra tante e mi piace un sacco quello che hai da dire
1269814 se il blog fosse un paese tu saresti sicuramente la piazza del duomo
1269815 quando non mi senti parlare vuol dire che sto parlando dentro
1269816 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
1269817 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice

1269850 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1269851 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1269854 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1269855 home owners with mortgages are not looking at what the rba does but what banks decide to do
1269856 we all know banks will take their time to pass on any cuts just like the servos with petrol if anything they will probably wait till the second half of next year to pass on any cuts its profit gouging profit making is no longer good enough
1269857 i think customers will be absolutely filthy if the banks do not pass on within a reasonable time any official cash rate reductions he said
1269858 triple whammy of factors was paving the way for a property boom once interest rates are cut again but news com au readers are less convinced an upturn is on the way
1269859 a rates cut just now wont fire up the market it would take at least 3 4 cuts and also would take the increased availability of credit and a return of consumer confidence that have both receded this year

1269862 i cant wait to get an album out there and be a part of nashville
1269863 ive been waiting for a long time to work with nashville and be one of the artists for them
1269864 i was confused but i was also really young so i didnt know much
1269865 i think it was good that i was let go because it gave me time to mature and grow up and build a fan base being on american idol
1269866 instead of going into an album having to build fans i now have fans going into releasing an album it made it a lot easier hopefully i will continue building that relationship with a bunch more people and get more fans
1269867 i think its kind of cool to be on the same label that i was on before just because i know everybody
1269868 before last week chinese president hu jintao had never given a press conference either at home or abroad in which reporters were allowed to ask questions but in a rare sign of media nous by the chinese government mr hu has addressed the carefully selected question of a small group of foreign journalists in beijing one week from the start of one of the most politicised olympic games in recent years chinas human rights record in tibet and xinjiang as well as media restrictions imposed by beijing mean the country is under the global spotlight like never before mr hu told foreign journalists there were bound to be differences in the way those issues were viewed by china and by other countries
1269869 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
1269870 the twenty or so foreign journalists at the press conference were treated to a bit of humour with mr hu saying that if pressed he would choose to represent his country in ping pong
1269871 i have a special interest for table tennis and swimming if i were to choose what kind of event i would like to take part in i would choose table tennis but i would like to let you know that since the line up of the chinese table tennis team is already finalised and made public it seems that my wish could not be granted
1269872 so the reporters were treated to the rarest of sights a chinese president smiling talking and cracking a joke with international media even if it was a pretty lame one and this week the chinese authorities appeared to allow some leeway after earlier turning its back on a promise to let foreign journalists covering the games complete access to the internet reporters at the olympic press centre were able to visit a few previously banned websites including those of amnesty international reporters without borders and deutsche welle but access to others remained blocked including any sites linked to the tibetan government in exile and the falungong movement mr hu insists journalists covering the games will be able to do their jobs
1269873 chinas door of opening up to the outside is always wide open no matter during the olympic games or after the olympic games we will as always welcome foreign reporters and journalists to come to this country to cover what is happening here
1269874 easy to fool people into believing that its structure determines practice
1269875 perhaps we need to focus on the causes of alienation and disillusionment that stop people from participating in communal and civic life
1269876 just to take it off the market and to save haggling ill offer you 20 million
1269877 its going for a million well ill offer two three
1269878 oh fuck it how much do you want for it heres 20 million
1269879 mobility has stirred the pot so thoroughly that the important differences between people are no longer strongly place related i t might be said that commitments are shifting from place related structures city state nation or neighborhood to those corporation profession friendship network that are themselves mobile fluid and for all practical purposes placeless
1269880 hey look heres a kid in greece talk to her
1269881 sorta similar but does identity online differ from the texts of identity irl or those contained in books i e the identity of an author
1269882 does identity online differ from the texts of identity irl or those contained in books i e the identity of an author
1269883 changes the whole notion of what it means to be text hence it must change text mediated conceptions of identity
1269884 i dont really think popularity would transfer from online to offline because youve got a bunch of random people you dont know its not going to make a difference in real life you know its not like theyre going to come visit you or hang out with you youre not like a celebrity or something
1269885 reality is that there exist subjective realities and a consensual reality
1269886 a lot of mobilization without a lot of articulate information dialogue or debate
1269887 so there are people willing to take action blindly as long as the issue can be characterized in terms of the broad narratives they identify with political organizers on the left or right would be fools if they didnt exploit this
1269888 how can we get yelp like descriptions of doctors rather than the ratemyprofessor esque ratings that do exist
1269889 the internet is a medium with no one blessing who can talk which is good which means anyone who wasnt hugged enough as a child can stir up and audience which is bad

1269896 ravi has earned the right to play he didnt perform as well as he would have liked in sri lanka maybe it was a wake up call for him
1269897 i think it was a bit of a reality check regarding just how tough cricket can be but he has gone back to essex this summer and you cant argue with anything he has done
1269898 he is one of the leading first class run scorers this season so he demands to be picked
1269899 he also got a double hundred in a one day game with leicestershire not many people have done that not even the great graham gooch
1269900 when i saw ravi as a youngster at 18 he was the most talented youngster ive ever seen now he is learning how to develop that talent into scoring runs
1269901 without building him up too much there is definitely something there and he has got the potential to be extremely good
1269902 kevin has got to play the way he wants to play look at his stats he is better than anyone in the side so why would you change let him go and do his thing
1269903 he is a fine player he has got confidence by the bucketload and he will probably take that into his captaincy the one thing we dont want is for him to change
1269904 he goes out to bat and will bat left handed switch shots and all those things but he doesnt just think about it on the spot you watch him practice in the nets
1269905 for the 2006 ashes series in australia he worked so hard at dealing with the short ball he works so hard on his fitness as well quite a lot of thought goes into the way he plays
1269906 he averages 50 odd with the bat in both forms of the game and he is an unbelievable talent
1269907 everyone will ask will his batting be affected but knowing kevin he will probably average 70 as captain
1269908 i enjoyed playing under michael he got the best out of his team he got the best out of me when he took over from nasser hussain there was a definite mood shift even in the week he took over
1269909 michael is relaxed and wanted people to express themselves and have fun playing and i think we did that for a long time it is sad that he has gone
1269910 it is massive boots to fill but i am sure kevin will be confident he can he is very single minded and talented i am sure he will be relishing it now
1269911 i dont think he will be thinking of the boots hes got to fill he will have a plan of what he has to do and how he wants to go about it
1269912 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1269913 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1269914 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1269915 hopefully his captaincy will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
1269916 the idea of twenty20 cricket at the olympics is definitely worth pursuing
1269917 if you want to globalise the game then you have to look at including countries like china and the united states and getting cricket into the olympics will fast track that move
1269918 i had the time of my life at those games
1269919 winning the silver medal was one of the highlights of my career
1269920 twenty20 is going through a honeymoon phase at the moment
1269921 but in the next few years i believe it will become a worldwide phenomenon
1269922 should cricket make it to the olympics it would be significant especially to our country where the game is most loved
1269923 it will help the players to be part of a worldwide movement cricket is an exciting sport and should definitely be part of the olympics
1269924 it would be a great feeling for cricketers to be part of the olympics and the icc should take the initiative
1269925 the twenty20 format of the game is an exciting prospect and i dont see any reason why it should not be included in the olympics
1269926 even though playing for the country at various international events is a thrill to represent the nation at the olympics would be a great honour
1269927 our strategic objective was to obtain ioc recognition for the benefit of our members
1269928 we achieved this at the first time of asking in december 2007 and now that we are in a position to compete for a spot on the olympic programme its only right that we now look at whether cricket and the olympic games would benefit from being reunited
1269929 im delighted to be a part of the volts set up and am really looking forward to playing some good cricket for them next season
1269930 playing cricket in new zealand has always been something ive wanted to do because i love the country and otago seemed an obvious destination with such a talented playing list who will be looking for success
1269931 after my experiences playing odi and twenty20 cricket for england and in the ipl with the rajasthan royals i really feel like i have something to offer the volts in terms of leadership and experience
1269932 i really cant wait to get out there and meet the boys
1269933 dimitri is a dynamic cricketer with the ability to win a match on his own
1269934 his aggressive approach to the game mirrors the philosophies of the volts and like new zealand wicketkeeper batsman brendon mccullum he is a cricketer who can change the course of a game in a very short space of time
1269935 the state otago volts are determined to build on their successes of last season and see dimitri mascarenhas as a player who can add excitement and skill in all three disciplines of the game
1269936 dimitri is clearly excited at the opportunity to play in an experienced and successful team under a management structure that encourages flair
1269937 with an english one day series against west indies in march dimitri will be well motivated to be in the best possible form during the state shield and twenty20 competitions
1269938 i think im playing well enough at this level still but the injuries are just getting too much its getting harder to get out of bed in the morning to start with
1269939 i know all of my family and all of laras family wanted me to come over here and play its hard being away from lara and her family but today was obviously very special to make a century knowing that my to be father in law would certainly have been proud of me
1269940 the constant speculation criticism and innuendo by former players and sections of the media have taken their toll in the interest of the team australian cricket and myself i have informed the acb of my decision to stand down as australian captain
1269941 i still firmly believe that this group of cricketers given the situation between england and zimbabwe and the political wranglings have been let down it leaves me as captain in isolation my trust in authority today and for the past few weeks has left me completely low
1269942 first of all thanks to bob we dedicate this to bob because he was a wonderful person an elder for us and hes not in this world now
1269943 every pakistani every cricket lover every man is sad about him
1269944 we decided well maybe the best way to deal with it was bring his wife hayley out
1269945 and then i was a little bit uncomfortable about that because was that going to help the problem
1269946 the doctor just had to sit and console him for about two hours or so after a while the doctor spoke to him and said to him its best if he does go home i only told the chaps last night after the game
1269947 i hope i can put the money to good use to try to redress the wrongs i have done to my game and my country

1269951 it wasnt a bad way to get through life that god loved the weak and suffering
1269952 por determinaci n de los compa eros se ha definido salir a las movilizaciones de los 5 000 mineros de huanuni lo que significa que se acata estrictamente la huelga general indefinida con bloqueo de caminos
1269953 los mineros estamos asumiendo esta medida de presi n por el caso omiso que hace el gobierno en el pedido de que se apruebe una nueva ley de pensiones que beneficie a los trabajadores de todo el pa s
1269954 lamentablemente el gobierno sigue con su tozudez porque no hace caso al pedido de los trabajadores considero que el presidente evo morales est rodeado de ministros neoliberales por eso existe una posici n radical de varios de sus ministros ya que no quieren escuchar a los trabajadores
1269955 los bloqueos tenemos que reiniciarlos porque no conf o en el di logo que es para desinflar y desorganizar pero s mantenemos la fuerza para que se cumpla y se ponga en la agenda de la c mara de diputados nuestro proyecto
1269956 hemos esperado por m s de dos a os y no hay nada el gobierno siempre usa el argumento de la conspiraci n de la derecha para desorganizar a los trabajadores para que dejemos de luchar por nuestros derechos
1269957 las reivindicaciones de la cob son leg timas pero ahora le est n haciendo el juego a la derecha si esa dirigencia intenta obligarnos a hacer cosas irracionales esto no lo vamos hacer as nos presionen
1269958 los dirigentes de la cob est n en movidas turbias
1269959 no se sabe si la dirigencia de la cob est desorientada o si ha tenidos puentes con la m s negra reacci n fascista separatista
1269960 veremos si seguimos con las medidas pero si no se soluciona nada y en el momento del revocatorio el gobierno dicta el auto de buen gobierno no se puede hacer nada

1269963 it was just great to get back onto the park again
1269964 we gelled as a pack of forwards so i cant take credit for everything because all the guys were awesome
1269965 i had five weeks to think about my injury every day every game so its great to be back
1269966 my main responsibility is to take the ball up and keegan daniel and jacques botes will support me so at the end we gel well as a loose trio
1269967 he was outstanding the guy has got springbok written all over him
1269968 there are not too many loose forwards who can make an impact on a game like that
1269969 it also emphasises the importance of having a guy who carries the ball that far across the advantage line

1269972 we thought of such an initiative after we came across some cases of child abuse at the child development service unit of imhans the paediatricians of kozhikode medical college wholeheartedly joined us to launch the initiative
1269973 we are coming across more cases of sexual abuses nowadays some children who are brought for unexplained fear or sudden disinterest in studies headache or stomach ache are found to be victims of abuse
1269974 a girl who was brought to us did not allow male doctors to examine her when we investigated further it was found that she was sexually abused
1269975 we will present the module before them and after due consultation will make changes if found necessary
1269976 our plan is to cover the districts of kozhikode malappuram and wayanad under the initiative the scheme will formally be launched on thursday

1269981 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1269982 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalised more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles
1269983 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1269984 at these high injected doses we hoped to see drug like activity that might be useful in cancer treatment
1269985 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1269986 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1269987 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1269988 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1269989 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception

1269994 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
1269995 it doesent matter if your goddamn head fell off or your legs exploded if you didnt make it you didnt make it one excuse is as good as another
1269996 as soon as we heard of the interest in robbie those of us who know him wanted the deal to happen
1269997 we know what he can add to the side and alongside fernando torres we feel weve a strikeforce to rival any in the premier league
1269998 a lot of liverpool fans see similarities to when we signed gary mcallister in 2000
