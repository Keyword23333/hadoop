7850019 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7850020 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7850021 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7850022 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7850023 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7850024 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7850025 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7850026 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7850027 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7850028 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7850029 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7850030 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7850031 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7850032 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it

7850068 the axon acquisition ought to strengthen infosys fast growing sap practice and enable it to increase its win rate in large size transformational deals going forward
7850069 we expect infosys to report revenue growth of 32 74 and 30 67 in fy2009 and 2010 respectively the acquisition while being a good fit in the long term would be viewed as a bit expensive in the near term the acquisition will be eps neutral in fy2009 and marginally eps accretive in fy2010 rs 122 5 v s rs 121 6 at the cmp of rs 1703 it quotes at 14 0x fy10e consolidated earnings we maintain market performer rating with a target price of rs 1837 15x fy10e earnings
7850070 we are currently marketing four portfolios totaling nearly 400 million that number will more than triple in the near term as we have over 1 3 billion in transactions slated over the next two quarters this increase in secondary market activity is representative of the changing economic conditions resulting from the general decline in the credit markets we are pleased to be assisting numerous financial institutions with the disposition of diverse portfolio types and are proud of the firms proven ability to execute successful loan sale transactions

7850073 i have been really encouraged by the players over the last few months in particular for the two pre season games
7850074 their commitment and attitude has been exceptional and the worcester game will be a good test for some players who havent featured against either bath or the reds
7850075 we play scarlets next friday at ravenhill and start what we hope will be a successful league campaign so obviously a win against worcester would be a great boost for the players
7850076 they are like us coming to the end of our pre season and gearing up for the start of a big league campaign
7850077 it will be another step up but at the same time what has been good for us in that we are seeing young players coming through who have shown us they are ready for the next step

7850080 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7850081 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was not planned to be disposed of by the company and investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
7850082 it seems that some organisations are still saying it cant happen here this latest incident involving data on american express natwest and royal bank of scotland customers shows that it can happen all too easily
7850083 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern

7850088 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7850089 that the russian government leadership now has chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
7850090 georgian president mikheil saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks
7850091 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
7850092 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7850093 we consider this is a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
7850094 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7850095 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
7850096 i hope georgian president mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
7850097 when ministers were appointed they made public and legally binding pledges which are not being fulfilled
7850098 this cannot continue a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for 18 september
7850099 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
7850100 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7850101 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7850102 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7850103 let me make it clear the dup will not respond to threats such as that which sinn fein has made
7850104 if we were to do so on this issue we would be vulnerable to having the republican threat of bringing the institutions down used again and again in order that we would comply with other sinn fein demands
7850105 nor indeed will we make political concessions in order to encourage any party to do that which it pledged to do and carry out duties which it is legally required to perform
7850106 let me deal with the inaccurate propaganda which is being disseminated by republicans about policing and justice the st andrews agreement between the government and the government of the republic of ireland neither bound nor required the dup to accept the devolution of policing and justice nor did it impose any timetable for such devolution
7850107 for some time i have sought to have the executive called together to deal with important outstanding business
7850108 i have cleared executive papers in order for business to be presented to ministers indeed i have approved sufficient work for several executive meetings

7850111 resolved that the primary effect of the alleged ongoing war on terrorism as launched and promoted by the bush administration and embraced by the ldc has not been significant progress toward the defeat of terrorism but rather the maintenance of either the existence or the appearance of a significant existential threat to the united states which masks and or purports to justify a massive transfer of wealth from the pockets of taxpayers to the bottom lines of corporations which support the american political status quo with campaign contributions sweetheart post government sinecures for cooperative public officials etc and other forms of bribery
7850112 in russia even more than in america kosovo rhymes with i told you so many americans dont realize that the former serbian province of kosovo which broke away in 1999 after us led nato forces bombed serbia for 78 days helped set the stage for the recent conflict between russia and neighboring georgia but russian leaders who like most leaders care intensely about what happens at their borders georgia and to their longtime allies serbia warned earlier this year that support for kosovos independence would set a precedent that could trigger separatist conflicts in places like georgia it was a warning that washington and several of its european allies foolishly even recklessly failed to heed
7850113 will the u s treasury repudiate its obligations to its creditors be they citizens or investors around the world most observers would answer no without hesitation but congress with the complicity of the white house and the fed has arguably embarked on a stealth repudiation in his famous treatise the wealth of nations adam smith noted there had never been a single instance of sovereign debts having been repaid once accumulated to a certain degree we may have reached smiths threshold

7850120 it is the nhs and it doesnt feel like the nhs if you have got private companies involved
7850121 im sure that patient care is top of their agenda but above that comes making money i dont think that is right
7850122 traditional gp practice has failed in really delivering a lot more access that people want
7850123 it struggles with telephone systems it has struggled with investment
7850124 i can understand people having concerns but the real issue from a taxpayers point of view is transparency
7850125 whoever the provider is are they going to do a decent job and are we going to see what they are doing with their money it is a question of regulation not who the provider is
7850126 i have abused a lot of rights i went fighting killing a lot of people destroyed a lot of people people who were not even part of the problem
7850127 when i met christ i saw an image of a man this guy was bright very bright so that i could not look at him twice
7850128 if the punishment deserved according to law and for the future history of this country is death fine if it is to be hanged fine if its life imprisonment fine or if they can pardon me fine also
7850129 the last time i gave the government and the nation two options either collect every one of us dig one big hole and cover us to die or they consider us and work with us to give us some discipline and use us as rebuilding tools
7850130 i am trying to do a lot of good to appeal for their forgiveness
7850131 my question is why does the westerner think that if a man is a killer then hes going to remain a killer why is it so

7850136 we are also very pleased with the independent test results for our sam radioisotope identifier product line in which it was selected the best unit for the hazmat team environment such results should impact our product sales the next 3 to 6 months

7850148 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7850149 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7850150 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7850151 this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in un security council resolutions it does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the caucasus
7850152 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people

7850204 were just letting people know that theres been these five inci dents over the past two days and there may be a bad batch of some thing out there
7850205 we arrived there and he was sweating profusely having se vere mood swings
7850206 most of them told us that they had ingested some type of pills they had bought on the street or crack co caine or both in some cases along with alcohol
7850207 the cause of death was not obvious and further tests are required includ ing toxicology which can take some time
7850208 our family is very proud of bruces many achievements these past few years
7850209 hes obtained his grade 12 and his forklift certification hes come a long way
7850210 he was conscious and breathing at the time that he was taken to hospital he was talking he was coherent
7850211 we will explore all the possibilities and work with staff and talk to other people who may have interacted with him earlier in the day to understand ex actly what happened
7850212 well be dealing with him more ex tensively from this point forward we do understand from our preliminary investigation that both inmates took illegal drugs prior to their ar rest
7850213 you acknowledged that your addic tion had reached a very serious state and became all consuming
7850214 we have a zero tolerance policy on illegal drugs and we work closely with police and communities to stop drugs from entering our institutions
7850215 any time there is an incident at any one of our institutions everything is placed under review
7850216 we were accused of running dropout factories but those numbers dont look like dropout factories to me
7850217 i think the new method is much more accurate because were getting a student by student measure and this will make sure no child is left behind
7850218 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7850219 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7850220 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7850221 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7850222 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7850223 hes a team player who improves the people around him and he wont back down from any challenge

7850235 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7850236 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7850237 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7850238 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7850239 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7850240 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7850241 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7850242 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7850243 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7850244 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7850245 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7850246 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7850247 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7850248 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7850249 i didnt do any of my own stunts in the fart department it was all with the help of computers they dont have the technology to place the microphones in the inner canal of my inner cavity at this point someday soon i hope theyll have the science and it will catch up to my flatulent talent
7850250 im so so excited the books really intrigued me when i was little and ive always loved the story

7850257 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7850258 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7850259 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7850260 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7850262 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7850263 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7850264 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7850265 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7850266 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7850267 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7850268 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7850269 who are open to doing something on the production side
7850270 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7850271 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7850272 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7850273 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7850274 our initial testing of the bread indicates that it is very palatable
7850275 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7850276 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

7850279 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised
7850280 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7850281 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7850282 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7850283 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7850284 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported

7850296 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7850297 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7850298 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7850299 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7850300 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7850301 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7850302 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7850303 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7850304 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7850305 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7850306 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7850307 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7850308 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7850309 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7850310 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7850311 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7850312 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7850313 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7850314 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7850315 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7850316 ich kann nur eines sagen ich bin hier in new york zum tennis spielen und nicht um mir gedanken zu machen f r welches land ich spiele ich bin als sterreicherin angetreten habe meinen erstrundensieg f r sterreich gefeiert die olympia geschichte ist abgehakt ich muss nach vorne schauen
7850317 ich habe in wien schon gesagt dass es nicht in meinem interesse liegt die nationalit t zu wechseln ich denke an ein leben nach der karriere wo ich als tamira paszek irgendwo leben werde und sagen werde okay ich bin mein leben lang sterreicherin gewesen und ich hab mich immer wohl gef hlt

7850323 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
7850324 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
7850325 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information
7850326 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7850327 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7850328 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7850329 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7850330 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7850331 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7850332 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7850333 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7850334 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7850335 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7850336 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7850337 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7850338 this is what youd call a manic depressive market and the volatility at this point just continues to scare people
7850339 even though its a minor gain right now with the financial instability going into the market everybody is hoping oil continues its downward movement or is at least stabilizing
7850340 and now nobody knows if its stabilizing or if its pivoting and is about to go back up

7850342 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7850343 the patience of the afghan people has ran out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
7850344 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7850345 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7850346 actually former british prime minister tony blair is willing to come to help us because he played a very strong part in the negotiations of northern ireland
7850347 contribute to a secure and stable environment in which an overall peace process and transition can be sustained
7850348 young women who were exposed to a number of life events should be considered as a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
7850349 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one meaningful life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7850350 on the other hand general feelings of happiness and optimism can play a protective role against the disease
7850351 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7850352 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7850353 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7850354 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7850355 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7850356 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7850374 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7850375 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
7850376 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7850377 the fact that the president signed the recognition of the independence of both territories is an irreversible act
7850378 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
7850379 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7850380 it does nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7850381 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7850382 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
7850383 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7850384 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7850385 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7850386 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7850387 shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7850388 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7850389 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7850390 those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7850391 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for a world as it should be and that is the thread that connects our hearts
7850392 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbably journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7850393 and you see that is why i love this country
7850394 a bullet proof vest two rifles ammunition walkie talkies and drugs
7850395 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them

7850407 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7850408 and i said to myself something is going on here
7850409 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7850410 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7850411 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7850412 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7850413 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise

7850438 the questions posed to mr bonds by two different prosecutors at his grand jury appearance were imprecise redundant overlapping and frequently compound
7850439 they want to see if there is any interest there
7850440 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7850441 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7850442 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7850443 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7850444 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7850445 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7850446 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7850447 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7850448 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7850449 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7850450 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7850451 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7850452 according to kasper it is as if there had been an unwritten agreement between schutz and the church of rome crossing certain confessional and canonical limits
7850453 the scope for a company like gemalto is tremendous as we go beyond cashless and even use mobile phones for payments
7850454 i believe that digital technology can make life easier for all especially for elderly persons in particular gemalto health id solutions facilitate the transfer of records between health professionals and patients who hold their own record doctors can easily retrieve their medical history quickly and accurately and patients no longer need to keep track of their personal information manually
7850455 innovation in digital security technology promises many new and exciting services to the consumer gemalto has already started deploying innovative technologies such as nfc mobile tv and health id in countries around the region singapore remains one of the key markets for us here and we are strongly committed to growing the adoption of the latest in technology in the republic
7850456 industrialised countries should agree to stop green house emissions even as we urge our people in the villages to stop cutting trees

7850466 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7850467 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7850468 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
7850469 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7850470 the fact that the president signed the recognition of the independence of both territories is an irreversible act
7850471 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
7850472 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7850473 it does nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus

7850479 i dont suppose it may have occurred to you that the cecal valve feature may have been already encoded in the genetic information of the lizard and was selected due to a changed diet or manifested through interbreeding with the indigenous population or maybe nobody ever noticed it before like the aforementioned rat
7850480 changes in appearance dont prove the generation of new genetic information you can change the diet of birds to tougher seeds and the shape of their bills will change you can drink a lot of beer and the shape of your gut will change these lizards changed their diet
7850481 their gut got bigger due to a changed diet and thus we are told that

7850487 during the interregnum before the government forces arrived you can just imagine the helpless civilians scampering to safety fleeing their homes took the boats to avoid the butchery
7850488 they felt betrayed they felt neglected they felt having fed to the lions to be devoured they felt they were left alone helpless in the hands of the ruthless criminals who call themselves as milf

7850496 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7850497 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7850498 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7850499 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7850500 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7850501 i suggest that we look into the contracts of the seafarers so that they wont be allowed to board ships that will pass through dangerous areas
7850502 we cannot risk the lives of our seafarers we have to look into their safety
7850503 we are not talking directly with the pirates because the government has a strong policy against negotiating with kidnappers
7850504 this is an unconfirmed report so far we dont have news of filipino death in any of the four abducted ships
7850505 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7850506 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7850538 in the case of the constitutional court we have to add three to the number and submit that to the president out of which he will choose one
7850539 for that you need a larger number than in the case of the high court we didnt receive sufficient numbers
7850540 the article as you are reading it to me is not correct
7850541 what i was informed was that the list was insufficient
7850542 the trouble is im a college student and not an affluent one and i simply do not have the time energy or resources to fight this battle right now theres a point at which i am willing to give up and be practical to let the world have its way with that ever mistreated little ideal of principle

7850556 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
7850557 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7850558 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
7850559 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together

7850575 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
7850576 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
7850577 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
7850578 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
7850579 in addition aptanas backing of pydev will provide more support and resources for the project and its users alike
7850580 the impact of the deterioration in the u s housing market has affected our results and while uncertainty exists we are confident in the earnings capacity of the core franchise
7850581 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7850582 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7850583 the headline profit number is certainly well ahead of expectations and the commentary associated with numbers appears very positive at this point in time
7850584 rios exposure to the bulk commodities sector has been extremely beneficial for the company and i think that the results will be very positively received by the market
7850585 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders

7850596 i dont think any georgian government can accept losing those territories
7850597 absolutely in the future this is a recipe for future clashes if it is accepted by the russian government sooner or later the fighting will re erupt
7850598 recognition by russia of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia is the necessary condition for ensuring the security of these peoples

7850809 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7850810 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different

7850820 dar ber hinaus kritisiert die sp n eine verteilung die ihre eigenen leute mit vereinbart und bislang auch immer gut gehei en und daher in der folge wohl auch als gerecht erkannt haben
7850821 und wenn die sp n die veranlagung der n wohnbaugelder kritisiert sei ihr ein f r alle mal gesagt wir haben unser familiensilber nicht verkauft wie andere bundesl nder sondern vergoldet nur so k nnen wir uns beispielgebende ma nahmen f r den bund wie das n pflegemodell oder die vorreiterrolle bei der kinderbetreuung leisten das sind konkrete hilfeleistungen f r die nieder sterreicherinnen und nieder sterreicher
7850822 vom vp seniorenbund kann man wirklich nicht verlangen dass er werbung f r gute ma nahmen von infrastrukturminister werner faymann macht man kann aber sehr wohl verlangen nicht bewusst die unwahrheit zu sagen denn die behauptung des seniorenbund generalsekret rs becker dass es keine 7 euro aktion der bb f r senioren im herbst gibt ist wider besseren wissens falsch
7850823 dass dann aber sofort mit unwahren aussagen und diffamierungen gearbeitet wird ist einer seniorenorganisation nicht w rdig ltere menschen sind f r die bb sehr wichtige kunden diese treuen kunden weiter an das unternehmen zu binden ist eine der vorrangigsten aufgaben der bundesbahnen daher ist diese verunsicherungsstrategie der vp vorfeldorganisation nicht nur in einem wahlkampf ein unfairer winkelzug vor allem aber eine gesch ftssch digende vorgangsweise gegen ber den bb ich fordere daher die vertreter der lteren vp generation auf bei den fakten zu bleiben

7850827 faymann l sst mit dem ende der 7 euro tickets f r senioren seine soziale maske fallen
7850828 dass faymann nun als chef der bb das 7 euro ticket f r senioren abschaffen will zeigt seine wahre unsoziale seite
7850829 sein wahlplakat l cheln kann nicht dar ber hinwegt uschen was im inneren seines herzens thront n mlich eisesk lte

7850840 die finanzpolitischen zaubertricks sind also leicht zu durchschauen es gibt nur zwei m glichkeiten entweder ist mit dem faymann paket die steuerreform gestorben oder es ist der startschuss f r eine neue sp schuldenpolitik die k nftige steuerzahler belastet
7850841 die erkl rung von lh p hringer und lh platter zum auslaufen der atomstrom vertr ge der tiwag ist das papier nicht wert auf das sie gedruckt ist erstens ist die tiwag selbst massiv in die produktion von atomstrom involviert und zweitens sind politische abkommen f r den vorstand der tiwag nicht bindend
7850842 es wurde unterstellt dass die gegenw rtigen preise f r natururan und trennarbeit kaum steigen werden ebenso werden die entsorgungskosten durch derzeit unvorhersehbare komponenten nicht berdurchschnittlich steigen
7850843 es w re auch un blich derartige einschr nkungen unserer gesch ftspraxis zu machen
7850844 wir haben einen wasserdichten aktion rsvertrag und da haben wir keine zusagen gemacht
7850845 wird der erforderliche beschluss der hauptversammlung mit einer nderung der satzung der tiwag wonach dem vorstand ab dem zeitpunkt x das gesch ft mit atomstrom untersagt wird in n chster zukunft gefasst werden erst dann kann von einem rechtlich bindenden atomausstieg ernsthaft gesprochen werden au erdem sind die rechtsfolgen zu hinterfragen wenn die tiroler einen derartigen beschluss nicht fassen gibt es dann einen passus in den vertr gen der die r ckabwicklung des 8 igen eag anteils verkaufs vorsieht
7850846 die gr nen haben sich ihre zustimmung scheinbar teuer abkaufen lassen indem sie die energiezukunft 2030 und den atomausstieg der vp vermeintlich abgerungen haben jetzt zeigt sich dass das energieszenario von der vp hintertrieben wird stichwort widerstand gegen solarenergie und mit der tiwag ein miteigent mer der eag nach ober sterreich geholt wurde der tief in der deutschen atomwirtschaft verankert ist die forderung der sp o den verkauf der energie ag r ckg ngig zu machen ist damit wichtiger als jemals zuvor denn nur so bleiben die ober sterreicherinnen die bestimmende gr e am heimischen energiemarkt
7850847 das sp ma nahmenpaket gegen die teuerung liegt auf dem tisch aber die vp sagt immer nur nein es zeugt von besonderer unverfrorenheit dass die wiener vp jetzt einen angriff auf b rgermeister h upl startet w hrend die vp bundespartei wichtige reformen weiterhin verschleppt
7850848 die teuerung belastet die menschen in sterreich massiv deshalb m ssen rasch ma nahmen zur entlastung gesetzt werden
7850849 wien hat im eigenen wirkungsbereich bereits gehandelt b rgermeister h upl hat eine anhebung der mieten im verantwortungsbereich der gemeinde bis jahresende bereits ausgeschlossen und auch eine geb hren anpassung wird es in wien 2008 sicher nicht geben
7850850 sp chef werner faymann hat ein vern nftiges paket vorgelegt vp landesgesch ftsf hrer norbert walter ist aufgerufen seine vp kollegen auf bundesebene von ihrer sturen nein sager politik abzubringen
7850851 dieses vorgehen ist ein wichtiges signal wer in unserem land leben will muss wissen dass er sich an unsere rechtsordnung zu halten hat vor allem gewalt wird in keiner form geduldet wer das nicht einsehen will f r den ist hier kein platz
7850852 they are greatly in error who when communing rely on the fact that they have confessed or that they are not aware of any mortal sin and have said their prayers but if they believe and trust that in the sacrament they receive grace this faith alone makes them pure and worthy
7850853 of timid conscience who prepare themselves for the sacrament with much worry and woe and yet have no peace and do not know how they stand with god
7850854 faith alone must always be the proper cleansing and worthy preparation
7850855 he is truly worthy and well prepared who believes these words
7850856 they have interpreted this saying to mean that we should examine our consciences for sin although it means rather that we should examine ourselves for faith and trust since no man can discover all his mortal sins
7850857 i wish we would be driven away from works and into faith for the works will surely follow faith but faith never follows works
7850858 yesterdays ruling combined with the decline ininternational cement prices is seen to drive local pricesdown
7850859 people think that if this was the case for cement it couldbe happening also for ezz which is also investigated for allegedmonopoly practices
7850860 amf has a significant pipeline due to the demand for capital from a significant number of high quality asset managers
7850861 in addition amf has significant opportunities for growth outside the us we look forward to leveraging our single center of excellence model to expand and grow amfs business
7850862 we are here for one purpose to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7850863 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7850864 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7850865 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7850866 absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes senator clinton has pledged wholehearted support to my campaign as has president clinton
7850867 they have to make those voters comfortable with barack obama have to make them think hes part of the american dream
7850868 there is no stronger surrogate for sen obama among senator clintons supporters than senator clinton
7850869 so we are confident as we come through this convention that our party will come together it might take a little time for some people to come around but we cant let the few voices distort the vast majority of her supporters that i do believe support senator obama
7850870 many are coming our way it will take a little longer

7850878 you have to combine homecare with community and social care
7850879 its not enough to change the dressing for somebody who had a knee replacement if they have no food in the fridge or they cannot pick up their medication
7850880 this is my first opportunity to be in yarmouth and im very impressed
7850881 this is a very active branch and the board is very active in supporting the von and the community
7850882 the lives of tens of thousands of people would be very different if not for the incredible work that volunteers do
7850883 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record

7850889 you have some positive things going on the dollar strengthening is putting pressure on crude oil and thats helping some underlying support to the market after yesterdays sharp sell off
7850890 clearly the new home sales important for the economic outlook consumer confidence could also be key if we can see some better than expected numbers here maybe we can build on the gains spurred by the weaker oil price
7850891 we have been battling inflation from the start of the year it has been higher than in previous years but i expect it willcalm down by the end of the year
7850892 with central bank and government measures i expectinflation of 6 6 5 percent in december there are no reasonsfor psychological fears of a further inflation rise
7850893 taking any new debt just for public spending would bedisastrous it would only generate new deficit and inflation

7850895 i really want to make sure that not just my kids but the kids in our district get homework that is really driving them toward being successful

7850897 during an hour at a municipal pool you will ingest 1 12 liter of urine
7850898 what is so bad is this was a mixed audience
7850899 it was dealt with were not going to tolerate a presentation like this
7850900 for three straight years the mental health advisory team has reported that multiple deployments are affecting the armys mental health this year it reported that 27 percent of noncommissioned officers with three or more deployments had mental health problems compared with 12 percent on their first tour

7850906 there is enough talent on this team we should be brooks expounded on his goals yesterday
7850907 i think this is a real key year for us recruiting is going well finally after two back to back bowl wins and if we can make it three years in a row to the post season then i think national prominence is possible
7850908 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
7850909 i am grateful for the opportunity the federation president gave me to direct the team at the olympics but i want to train throughout the season not just for two months a year
7850910 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7850911 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7850912 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7850913 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7850914 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7850915 instead of looking for a particular kind of structure we came up with a broader algorithm that is able to look for all of these structures and weigh them against each other
7850916 i actually ran into julio in the spring recruiting i said hello to him i said well i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august and then he got out and got in his cadillac escalade and drove off thats serious
7850917 and then i went over and watched burton scott at vigor high school at the track over there and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off so im familiar with those two guys
7850918 como medida de precau o o comandante desceu e desviou o avi o ao aeroporto de limoges por volta das 23h30 hora local francesa 18h30 de bras lia os 168 passageiros desembarcaram bem ap s a aterrissagem
7850919 a minha n o enchia de oxig nio e a do meu filho tamb m n o olhei para a mulher que estava minha esquerda e a dela tamb m n o enchia
7850920 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7850921 and i said to myself something is going on here
7850922 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7850923 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7850924 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7850925 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7850926 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7850927 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7850928 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7850929 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7850930 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7850931 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7850932 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7850933 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7850934 a professional organisation holding this kind of data should have tested the disks to make sure the information was destroyed
7850935 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7850936 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7850937 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was not planned to be disposed of by the company and investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations
7850938 we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
7850939 it is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records are kept secure at all times the ico said in a statement
7850940 if companies are disposing of computer equipment they must take the necessary steps to ensure that any personal information stored on the hard drive is rendered unrecoverable we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring
7850941 if solutions are not forthcoming we will have no alternative but to marshal our forces for strike action
7850942 o jap o est preocupado com a decis o da cor ia do norte de suspender o desmantelamento de sua usina de yongbyon

7850946 todas as resolu es pr vias do conselho de seguran a da onu apoiaram a integridade territorial e a plena soberania da ge rgia esta foi e continua sendo nossa posi o
7850947 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7850948 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7850949 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7850950 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7850951 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7850952 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7850953 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7850954 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7850955 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7850956 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7850957 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7850958 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7850959 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7850960 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7850961 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7850962 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7850963 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7850964 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7850965 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7850966 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7850967 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7850968 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7850969 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7850970 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7850971 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7850972 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7850973 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7850974 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7850975 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7850976 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7850977 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7850978 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7850979 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7850980 senderos has gone to milan today and will complete a medical
7850981 at the moment he does not get the games here and so now he can play somewhere and remains in a top level club
7850982 we have johan djourou we have kolo toure we have senderos we have alex song william gallas and mikael silvestre now who can play centre back so we have a congestion there
7850983 um dia hist rico para nosso povo estou agradecido s autoridades e ao povo da r ssia pelo grande passo que deram hoje ao reconhecer a independ ncia da abkh zia
7850984 este um grande dia na hist ria de nosso pa s e nosso povo r ssia nos salvou do genoc dio e nos deu a possibilidade de nos desenvolver e viver em nossa terra
7850985 haver alguns seguidores da senadora clinton junto aos quais teremos de nos esfor ar para coloc los a bordo isso n o surpreendente
7850986 mas se voc s olharem acho que nesta semana estou absolutamente convencido de que tanto hillary clinton quanto bill clinton entendem o que est em jogo
7850987 foi criado pelos av s que eram gente da classe trabalhadora assim como meus pais e por uma m e solteira que lutava para pagar as contas assim como n s fizemos
7850988 venho aqui como uma mulher que ama o marido e acredita que ele ser um presidente extraordin rio venho aqui como uma m e cujas filhas est o no cora o do meu cora o e no centro do meu mundo

7850990 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7850991 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7850992 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7850993 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7850994 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7850995 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7850996 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7850997 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7850998 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7850999 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7851000 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7851001 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7851002 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7851003 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7851004 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7851005 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7851006 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7851007 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7851008 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7851009 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7851010 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7851011 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7851012 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7851013 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7851014 i think i have a much higher i q than you do
7851015 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7851016 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7851017 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7851018 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7851019 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7851020 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7851021 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7851022 una comunidad de acogida como la valenciana el conocimiento mutuo el respeto a la libertad religiosa y a la diversidad cultural son las herramientas claves para que la integraci n se propicie en nuestra sociedad
7851023 impulsa la integraci n a trav s del di logo interreligioso

7851029 el di logo interreligioso a adi es una herramienta de mediaci n social y cobra especial importancia si tenemos en cuenta que los flujos migratorios de los ltimos tiempos han contribuido al incremento de las comunidades religiosas

7851050 in den ersten beiden zellen haben wir material von der oberfl che und der eishaltigen zwischenschicht untersucht und die ergebnisse waren relativ hnlich
7851051 in der dritten zellen wollen wir nun eine probe untersuchen die vielleicht etwas andere ergebnisse liefert
7851052 die kleinen gr ben zwischen den waben sind eine art falle wo sich material ansammeln kann

7851054 the go ahead when zack snyder immediately after his surprise hit with
7851055 we love people so come on along oh and could you give me a scratch right there under my ear
7851056 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7851057 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7851058 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7851059 absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7851060 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7851061 make it buttony and employ mouseovers to give confirmatory feedback
7851062 go for creative ways of grabbing attention they do not have to be large things
7851063 i think youll be able to imagine many things senator mccain will be able to say
7851064 hes never been the president but he will put forth his lifetime of experience i will put forth my lifetime of experience senator obama will put forth a speech he made in 2002
7851065 takutnya kalau nanti pasang dan bosen takutnya bongkar pasang nah takutnya kayak gitu

7851067 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7851068 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7851069 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7851070 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7851071 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home
7851072 nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7851073 theyre very aware that it may be the last major speech he ever gives theyre hopeful its not but fearful it might be
7851074 one of the highlights of the evening if not the entire democratic convention
7851075 i dont care if youre a democrat or a republican youre going to be moved by that
7851076 wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7851077 this is the first time most americans are getting any sense of who michelle obama really is shes a very poised and accomplished speaker a real professional
7851078 piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7851079 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7851080 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7851081 i dont want to just introduce my sister i want to introduce you to my sister the girl i grew up with the poised young woman i saw her grow in to the compassionate mother aunt and sister in law she is the passionate voice for women and children she has become and the type of first lady she will be
7851082 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7851083 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it
7851084 having worked on the choreography of these before you need to grab peoples attention with a message early on not to let these sort of hours get frittered away
7851085 i think well have the majority of our customer growth coming here for the next several years
7851086 one of the things weve been working on is our high skill high wage effort and this is the perfect example of the type of company were trying to attract
7851087 i dont think it could have come at a better time for lakeland
7851088 there have been a lot of committee meetings and caucuses
7851089 and you know what they are they are gatherings of people you already know
7851090 im here for labor and there were union caucuses galore
7851091 it is a combination of rock concert and the super bowl and there are street vendors all over the city selling anything with an o on it
7851092 i am not aware that we have been released yet but i expect it either tonight or today
7851093 i like his message and i liked it in 2004 when he was the vice presidential candidate
7851094 and what has happened is tragic but it is not for me to judge my heart goes out to him and to his wife
7851095 i must have had my picture taken 50 times today
7851096 you had a right to expect an excellent job and we didnt do it next time around its going to be excellent
7851097 its hectic and even more so because of the storms because they wouldve come here once and at least put up their supplies
7851098 he went to pre k and we kind of started early so i prepped him early
7851099 i told him youre going to big kids school now
7851100 there was anxiety and she was anxious because of the storms
7851101 but she didnt cry and she was excited when she saw the crayons
7851102 i will guarantee you the electorate in 2008 is going to be changed fundamentally in some pretty important ways
7851103 both of these states have enormous numbers of african american and younger voters who either werent registered or were registered and did not turn out in 2004
7851104 so we have a great ability here to adjust the electorate
7851105 we stay laser focused on both of those things every day
7851106 the republican party turns out new voters at a higher rate than democrats proven time and again
7851107 i dont worry about the weather with the potential for rain later in the day i would encourage people to get out and vote early but i dont think it will be a factor in keeping people home edwards said
7851108 i feel we are poised for a smooth election we are very confident in our equipment and our poll workers
7851109 using the trucks is like taking a pistol to a gun fight instead of a machine gun
7851110 about 25 million gallons a day to three discharge points that eventually go to the st johns river
7851111 if we had that system in place today wed be so much farther ahead of the curve
7851112 we can just keep pumping the water and hope for the best
7851113 we had the pumps in place but this was an extraordinary event
7851114 it overwhelmed our drainage system and overwhelmed our pumps we had 20 inches of rain in 24 hours
7851115 replenishing those supplies and getting inventories back up to where they should be is driving a lot of defense contracts these days
7851116 in many cases the weapons need to be repaired remanufactured or brought up to date whether it involves helicopters tanks or vehicles
7851117 it was a pleasure to sit down with senator mccain and discuss firsthand an issue that is americas top priority ending our dependence on foreign oil which today is approaching 70 percent during the meeting i reiterated the urgency of the situation i told him that any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our foreign dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 in the next 10 years on top of conservation that is beginning to happen must utilize proven and available technologies and be 100 percent comprised of american resources while i can not speak for the senator my sense is that he was interested and encouraged by the work we are doing and recognizes that citizen education and citizen involvement is key to changing course and actually developing a real energy policy with teeth that will help this country from our current disastrous path

7851127 an acquaintance recently called right after they took a pint of blood from him it was taken because hes scheduled for hip surgery soon and its done so they can have a bit of his blood handy in case some is needed when hes under the knife as they say blood withdrawal is no big deal in my opinion but when he phoned he was an emotional wreck asking specifically what would be best for him to do to stimulate his body into rebuilding his blood lever back to where it was before they took a pint out of him and the crazy part is hes a dentist youd think a dentist would already know about such matters anyway he was dont practice medicine but if you explain a health problem to me ill tell you exactly where to go and who to see for the best treatment and care on planet earth
7851128 come on only an idiot would say no to that question
7851129 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

7851154 they made my d lineman moves pretty good maybe they saw the bowl game
7851155 i really have no idea how they do this they lopped me navarre and pretty much all the d linemen into one position so the strings are all out of whack

7851188 remember the 18 4 billion that congress appropriated at the urgent request of the president of the united states in the fall of 03 for which i helped floor manage and took on the responsibility along with others to push hard because i believe there is a nexus between the reconstruction and the physical safety and possible success of our military in the region just 6 billion of that 18 4 billion has been spent

7851194 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

7851202 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7851203 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7851204 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7851205 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7851206 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7851207 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7851216 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7851217 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7851218 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7851219 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7851224 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7851225 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7851226 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

7851230 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7851231 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7851232 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7851233 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7851234 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7851235 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7851275 but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
7851276 for some people having a fry up with bacon and sausages might seem like a good way to start the day
7851277 but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers in the uk
7851278 this is important because there is convincing evidence excess body fat increases risk of six different types of cancer
7851279 when you consume ordinary noodles made from wheat or corn you may soon feel your stomach empty but this soybean noodle delays such a feeling of hunger
7851280 one never knows what kind of bacteria and germs are found on them
7851281 we have reported it as a crime to the police and it is now being examined to determine whether it should be dealt with as defamation or incitement
7851282 its great coming back in the ranks and concentrating on your own job hopefully ill be scoring big runs
7851283 i just found the captaincy was added responsibility which was very draining
7851284 the thing was it was taking the form away in test cricket and that was the last thing i wanted it to do
7851285 i thought it was too much of a coincidence that i scored a hundred against west indies just before i got the captaincy last year and i scored another hundred the day after i gave it up
7851286 not less than one million people in the widespread flooding
7851287 the marooned people have to be evacuated to safe places to save their lives after the shift in course in the kosi river
7851288 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised
7851289 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7851290 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 23 30 local french time
7851291 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
7851292 no oxygen was delivered through the oxygen masks and i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
7851293 there was absolutely communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
7851294 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
7851295 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed as soon as the captain got the plane down to 8000 ft he did make the appropriate announcement that they were going to divert to limoges for safety reasons
7851296 this is always a traumatic experience for passengers but the crew dealt with it appropriately
7851297 such marriages violate human rights by depriving a girl of her childhood
7851298 we face no option but to oppose any sell off
7851299 and there is a simple reason i got elected to do what is right not necessarily what is popular
7851300 the easy thing would have been to not have taken action but that would have been the wrong thing by nsw
7851301 there are particular times in the life of the leader of the opposition when you actually have to show some leadership when you have to step up when you have to tell the people of this state what you stand for
7851302 the premiers made very clear what his position is at some political cost the leader of the opposition has to make his position clear too
7851303 i dont think barry realises how close he is coming to seriously getting the business community offside
7851304 ive invited a number of people to offer their views to me i invited the business community in this afternoon to see me
7851305 ill listen to that advice ill listen to the advice i get as i walk down the street today and on thursday therell be a decision
7851306 we have party meetings commencing tomorrow we have shadow cabinet on thursday and a joint party meeting on thursday and well have a vote on thursday or friday whenever mr iemma brings it on
7851307 seit monaten werden die m rkte von mehr oder weniger starken pessimismuswellen bewegt in den vergangenen stunden lief wieder mal eine neue durch
7851308 declared him medically fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
7851309 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
7851310 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history
7851311 in fact many people were very impressed to see mr zardari go through the trauma of the assassination of benazir bhutto but still hold himself together hold his family especially his children close to him at this very difficult time
7851312 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
7851313 this is clearly a limit implicating schoolchildren at the behest of casteist elements
7851314 obviously the bjp is trying to consolidate anti dalit sentiment and strengthen its base in the jat belt of chahar wati
7851315 the city was suffering from so many other problems these politicians should have focused on better living conditions for people instead they are raking up non issues ahead of the polls
7851316 children are above castes and classes they do not even understand the meaning of certain words
7851317 the state government has failed to a great extent to control the violence by the vhp the police was not taking any steps to control the mob
7851318 if the state cannot ensure the safety of its citizens the central government should deploy the armed force there we cannot allow the anarchy to continue
7851319 the christian community in india abhors violence condemns all acts of terrorism and opposes groups of people taking the law into their own hands
7851320 whatever steps are required to maintain peace and harmony in all areas of orissa to prevent further attacks on christians and to arrest those responsible for the deaths of saraswati and his associates
7851321 it is a reflection of the fascistic mindset of these organisations that they could attack a place housing innocent unprotected children
7851322 the communalists have been emboldened because of the support being extended by the bjp a coalition partner in the orissa government
7851323 the current spate of violence against christian clergy religious institutions including churches and service organisations such as orphanages is part and parcel of the sangh parivars larger conspiracy to turn state after state into a hindutva laboratory
7851324 all right thinking people irrespective of political and religious affiliation should join hands to stop this communal frankenstein who is out to tear apart the nations fragile secular fabric
7851325 it is a blatant lie and calibrated disinformation propagated by the organisations whose contribution to the nation was just chaos and destruction
7851326 christians have been living in orissa for the last 200 years still they constitute less than two percent of the population where is the evidence for these allegations we want to know what is the contribution of these organisations to indias social sector
7851327 the event will showcase 11 of indias finest couturiers and aims to provide a platform for indian couture in the same way that the wills lifestyle india fashion week has been a powerful stage for indian pr t a porter
7851328 we are delighted to formally announce the staging of indias first couture fashion week hdil india couture week this event will be a celebration of indian fashion and will feature some of the countrys finest couture designers
7851329 after a period of relative unrest in the industry it is wonderful to see the fashion community coming together on one platform to progress the cause of indian fashion
7851330 we are proud to be associated with hicw an event created to celebrate indias fashion heritage by showcasing leading couture designers of the day
7851331 this move into fashion is in broader synergy with the groups long term strategies and objectives we believe fashion especially in the area of couture and bridal wear is a central interest in the lives of a great proportion of indians we would like to be part of ensuring that indias fashion heritage is preserved and nurtured our core belief at hdil is in creating value and with hdil india couture week we would like to create value for the indian fashion industry
7851332 for most of us everyday stress and anxiety has become an inescapable part of modern life our new range of products provides apt solution to this problem
7851333 each range contains effective active natural ingredients based on traditional herbal remedies to address everyday concerns
7851334 due to the delay in the launch of new malls in hyderabad and chennai our store launches got postponed we are all geared up to get feedback from these two cities
7851335 we are also planning to open 5 10 more stores by the end of this year
7851336 ludhiana has the highest per capita ownership of mercedes benz cars in the country it was a wise decision and we are getting good response from the city
7851337 if india can help pakistan with better education and medical facilities pakistan can help india as we produce the worlds best sports material cotton textiles and surgical instruments

7851339 i think this is what our friend is trying to say
7851340 it was a premature birth and the babies were underweight
7851341 we used the nrc kit and the blood tested hiv negative
7851342 when there are conflicting results the blood has to be tested thrice more
7851343 we did that as well as test the blood of the parents to see if the infection could have come from them while the parents tested negative the babys blood however was found to be hiv positive
7851344 all over nepal hospitals are conducting blood tests using the nrc approved kit if the kit is faulty it is a serious issue as there could be other erroneous tests
7851345 we run a poor patients fund at the hospital and we agreed to put nepali rs 100 000 there for the boy on purely humanitarian grounds
7851346 we also agreed on the same grounds to provide free treatment for the baby as long as he is with us
7851347 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7851348 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7851349 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7851350 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7851351 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

7851355 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7851356 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7851357 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7851358 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7851359 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7851360 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7851361 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7851362 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7851363 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7851364 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7851365 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7851366 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7851367 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7851373 it is not just the downpour in the rivers catchment area upstream that is responsible for the sudden rise in the gomti water level here
7851374 the rise is also due to gomtis backflow on account of the rising level of the ganga river
7851375 we deployed boats to evacuate people from certain marooned villages on the citys outskirts while a large number of pumps have been pressed into service to drain excess water from low lying urban and semi urban localities
7851376 of these 93 were washed away in floods while the rest had met their end in house collapses largely in the rural areas
7851377 all the iits want formal exemption from implementing quota in appointment of faculty like in the space and atomic energy departments
7851378 since the last 46 years both the above departments have been exempted from quota in the appointment of scientists and we were in the same bracket too till recently
7851379 but since it has been pointed out that the iits are not immune to faculty reservation i personally conveyed to the prime minister today about the problem
7851380 we want the government to formally announce exemption to us for better educational quality at the iits
7851381 the sanctity of the iits needs to be preserved to ensure quality education
7851382 there is no discrimination or groupism within the iits we need to preserve this character
7851383 he assured that he would take up the case in the cabinet and the iit standing committee would also take note of it
7851384 the iits have served our country with great distinction i take note of the point that prof gautam barua has made with regard to the reservation issue i take that with me and will bring it to the notice of my cabinet colleagues
7851385 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7851386 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7851387 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7851388 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7851389 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7851390 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7851391 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7851392 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7851393 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7851394 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7851395 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7851396 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7851397 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7851398 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7851399 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7851400 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7851401 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7851402 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7851403 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7851404 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7851405 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7851406 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7851407 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7851408 weil die inflation weiter hoch geht sucht der anleger nach etwas rendite st rkeren investitionsm glichkeiten als renten die aktie f llt dabei aber weitestgehend aus hier haben sich viele schon ein blaues auge geholt

7851410 hier wird aus einigen fonds geld abgezogen und in andere wieder hinein gesteckt so dass sich langsam einige produkte herauskristallisieren
7851411 biotechnologieunternehmen sowie die gesamte pharmabranche trotzen der krise weitestgehend das liegt daran dass der sektor lange zeit ignoriert und untergewichtet wurde weil sich viele investoren vor allem auf finanzwerte und zyklika konzentriert haben die biotech werte erleben daher eine art revival das sich in einer outperformance gegen ber den meisten indizes zeigt

7851414 millbank is a high risk dangerous individual who thought he could evade the reach of law enforcement by travelling overseas this is yet another example of how collaboration by the police services involved has brought another offender to account
7851415 offenders who believe they can escape punishment by travelling abroad underestimate our determination to bring them to justice alongside our partners we use every power available and take every step to track them down
7851416 we are delighted with the success of the website so far by working alongside crimestoppers local police forces and most importantly the public we have managed to locate 11 offenders out of a possible 15 in less than two years
7851417 this is a great example of how well law enforcement agencies can work together in tracing a high risk sex offender we would like to thank those members of the public from across europe who contacted us with information

7851476 i see this nation differently than i did 10 months ago
7851477 that this travesty was committed by the democratic party has forever changed my approach to politics
7851478 this is not the usual reaction to an election loss
7851479 i know that is the way it is being spun but its not prototypical anyone who doesnt take time to analyze it will do so at their own peril
7851480 that the winter of discontent in politics had come for women
7851481 the american womans movement and her interest in great moral and social questions is splintered into a hundred fragments under as many warring leaders
7851482 the feminist movement is dying of partial victory and inanition

7851498 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
7851499 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated

7851507 although lumbar spondylosis is a major cause of low back pain and disability in the elderly few epidemiologic studies have been performed
7851508 we investigated the prevalence of radiographic lumbar spondylosis using a large scale population and examined the association with low back pain
7851509 the present cross sectional study using a large population revealed a high prevalence of radiographic lumbar spondylosis in the elderly
7851510 gender seems to be distinctly associated with kl 2 and kl 3 lumbar spondylosis and disc space narrowing with or without osteophytosis in women may be a risk factor for low back pain

7851551 we play scarlets next friday at ravenhill and start what we hope will be a successful league campaign so obviously a win against worcester would be a great boost for the players
7851552 they are like us coming to the end of our pre season and gearing up for the start of a big league campaign
7851553 it will be another step up but at the same time what has been good for us in that we are seeing young players coming through who have shown us they are ready for the next step

7851555 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
7851556 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
7851557 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
7851558 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
7851559 in addition aptanas backing of pydev will provide more support and resources for the project and its users alike

7851567 usted me habla de situaciones y elementos del pasado nuestro trabajo consiste en promover la recta fe de la iglesia el santo oficio o la inquisici n no representan la realidad actual cuando me preguntan sobre el dogma respondo que la misericordia de dios como recuerda dante tiene los brazos muy grandes he aqu la clave bondad y misericordia
7851568 ladaria no va a decir una palabra de m s ni va a hacer da o a nadie es impensable tiene todas las cualidades y conocimientos para el cargo que le ha dado el papa pero no veo c mo imaginarlo un inquisidor es prudente abierto inteligente serio y muy poco amante de las dignidades eclesi sticas estoy seguro de que se ha resistido mucho antes de aceptar el nuevo cargo

7851701 i think what you see happening is basically this hex is an intriguing character written well by a team who put a lot of thought and care into what they are doing
7851702 its also not a super hero title which is attractive to folks like myself a western with mostly one shot stories you just cant beat that combination this is why you see artists wanting to do this title
7851703 some artists come to hex because they like the book and are looking to do something different sometimes it is a love of the character and sometimes it is a desire to work on stories that allow them to illustrate stories that they might not normally be offered
7851704 thats the beauty of doing a single issue story format it allows an artist to dive into a project that is short and sweet
7851705 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
7851706 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
7851707 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
7851708 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

7851711 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
7851712 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
7851713 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
7851714 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
7851715 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
7851716 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7851717 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
7851718 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
7851719 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7851720 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7851721 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7851722 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7851723 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7851724 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7851725 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7851726 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7851727 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7851728 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7851729 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7851730 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7851731 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7851732 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
7851733 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
7851734 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
7851735 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
7851736 reinforcing what everyone thinks they know about the place this was brand marketing at its most effective
7851737 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
7851738 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7851739 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7851740 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7851741 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7851742 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7851743 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7851744 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7851745 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7851746 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7851747 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7851748 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7851749 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7851750 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7851751 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7851752 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7851753 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and
7851754 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7851755 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7851756 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7851757 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7851758 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7851759 i was delighted to work with the linenhall library on a retrospective tribute to davids work a few years ago
7851760 the range and innovation of the films we screened are testament to davids unique talents however the greatest joy was in working with david himself on the project
7851761 every meeting was punctuated with wit warmth and insight and it was a great privilege to see a great teacher at work
7851762 while the legislation will help employers hire staff before full criminal record checks have been completed there will still be robust safeguards and monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that all applications are suitable for the positions to which they are appointed
7851763 it means that you cant employ the people you need to provide the service that elderly people require and i think thats disgraceful
7851764 one had got funding to run a summer scheme for 35 young people with and without disabilities in fact those 35 young people have been denied that experience
7851765 we have a legal responsibility under our pledge of office to support the good governance of ni
7851766 the executive meetings should be called there have been important issues raised that should have been dealt with at the executive and very clearly we have a meeting scheduled for 18 september
7851767 if that were not to take place there would be very serious consequences not only for the good governance of northern ireland but for those who would stop northern ireland being governed properly
7851768 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men

7851884 asserting that a single football team could not produce a football game
7851885 is less of a legal argument than it is a zen riddle who wins when a football team plays itself
7851886 i t thus follows that only one source of economic power controls the promotion of nfl football it makes little sense to assert that each individual team has the authority if not the responsibility to promote the jointly produced nfl football
7851887 uncontradicted evidence that the nfl teams share a vital economic interest in collectively promoting nfl football

7851892 liberia hosts the last two significant blocks of the remaining closed canopy tropical rainforest within the upper guinea forests of west africa this is largely due to the fact that liberias forest and natural resource especially timber was sustainably managed before the liberian civil crisis the upper guinea forests has now shrunk to an estimated 12 7 of its original size estimated to be 727 900 square kilometers almost 42 of this remaining forest is in liberia although other factors contribute to the problem of deforestation in liberia logging companies have remained the single most destructive force and were responsible for the larger percentage of deforestation for example from 1997 to 2001 log production increased by more than a staggering 1 300 unsurprisingly this had an enormous impact on indigenous rural communities and local people who depend on the land and the forest for their livelihood their cultural and spiritual practices are so dependent on the forest that with the rapid loss of forest the survival and growth of these communities was severely endangered the livelihood of rural people the overwhelming percentage of liberians is inextricably linked to the forest they depend on the land and the forest for food clean water medicine and other forest products for survival their relationship with the forest is the cornerstone for their cultural and spiritual practices for instance in the poro and sande societies traditional bush schools can only be conducted in very isolated highly forested areas where hunting and survival skills are taught traditional legal institutions especially those involving elders and zoes elders who make up the supreme decision making body in rural communities usually sit in the deep forest to hear cases of grave significance to the people because the forest is so central to their lives the destruction of the forest will ultimately have severe consequences for future generations the oriental timber company was symbolic of what has been wrong with the liberian logging industry from grand bassa through rivercess to sinoe county the company spearheaded the destruction of the forest this fragmentation of the forest significantly contributed to the massive displacement of wildlife while rendering them vulnerable to hunting contrary to what the logging companies explain is development roads constructed by them were primarily to facilitate harvesting and delivery of logs several dozen logging roads of absolutely no value to local people when the company moved out severely fragmented the forest the most noticeable social impact on local communities where logging companies set up bush camps was the introduction of prostitution drugs alcohol and gangsterism most teenage girls involved in prostitution only returned to their homes when they realized that they were pregnant

7851952 the overall situation is that in the face of increased competition and conflict over land rights for mining development logging and other economic activities and as a result of trends towards market based land reforms and environmental and health disasters african women are fast losing their already precarious access to land and resources hiv positive women or widows and children orphaned by hiv and aids risk losing all claims to family land and natural resources
7851953 the targets and goals to eradicate hunger and achieve food security will not be attained unless governments and international organisations take specific action to end the persistent discrimination against women in matters of access to ownership and control over land and natural resources in africa because women produce up to 80 of the food in developing countries yet now comprise 60 of those suffering from hunger
7851954 improved womens access control and ownership of land natural and productive resources are key to the achievements of these aims the process and content of the above africa framework and guidelines must fully adhere to african governments commitments in the icarrd declaration 2006 and the african unions protocol on the rights of women in africa 2003 on womens rights to land and natural resources to realize its aims

7852035 the council promised to keep us informed and i am absolutely disgusted that despite our letters and phone calls no one told us the meeting was taking place
7852036 the first i knew about it was when i read about it in the evening star
7852037 because our sea views will be affected so much the councillors asked if they could come and look round the hotel which they did and the officers said they would let us know when the meeting was so that we could go along and speak for three minutes

7852052 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7852053 he was hyperventilating from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7852054 our engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly
7852055 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7852056 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7852057 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7852058 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7852059 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7852060 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway

7852063 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
7852064 ayers is clearly a relevant issue as it relates to obamas pattern of relationships
7852065 its hard to see how one actually could resolve having any sort of relationship with an admitted remorseless domestic terrorist
7852066 be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7852067 the last time obama saw ayers was about a year ago when he crossed paths with him while biking in the neighborhood
7852068 the suggestion that ayers was a political adviser to obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false
7852069 the notion that me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense
7852070 it was a difficult time but those days are long over

7852072 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
7852073 i said i had a thousand regrets but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength
7852074 i have met and like john mccain but he bombed and presumably killed many people in a war i opposed
7852075 if i can set all that aside i would hope that americans will accept
7852076 very disturbed by ayers past and by his refusal to disavow what he did
7852077 i think the implications of this for obama are zero

7852093 these are communities that are populated by the warriors themselves
7852094 these are all equipped with fortifications barricades trenches and bunkers which only shows that these are not ordinary civilian villages or communities but are converted fortresses in terms of military operations
7852095 they are asking the law enforcement activities to be stopped but at the same time they continue to harbour and coddle those who committed the atrocities
7852096 this adds to the severe credibility problem which faces the milf
7852097 we will take our orders from sheik osama bin laden because we are his students
7852098 al qaeda is the mother of the holy war in somalia
7852099 most of our leaders were trained in al qaeda camps we get our tactics and guidelines from them many have spent time with osama bin laden
7852100 there are indications of a fairly close shabab al qaeda connection though its not clear to what extent theyve been operationalized
7852101 is shabab taking orders from al qaeda i would say no they are still running their own show
7852102 once we end the holy war in somalia we will take it to any government that participated in the fighting against somalia or gave assistance to those attacking us
7852103 and they cant afford to do that because the clans provide their foot soldiers
7852104 they are still a threat but clearly their network and operations have been degraded
7852105 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
7852106 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
7852107 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
7852108 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
7852109 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them
7852110 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
7852111 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
7852112 paddlings swats licks a quarter of a million schoolchildren got them in 2007 and black children american indians and kids with disabilities got a disproportionate share of the punishment according to a study by a human rights group

7852117 ill teach you to laugh at a white man you black bitch dont you know better than to laugh at a white man
7852118 please mr jess dont hit me no more iz sorry i swear i is so help me jesus i aint gonna laugh at no white man no more i swear i aint
7852119 this tall blue eyed white wrinkled face son of a bitch ive been waiting to say this for forty years looked at me
7852120 like a texas jackrabbit i jumped behind my aunt lenas wide dresstail she turned and slapped me full in the face the day turned into a night of stars

7852123 even little kids can be paddled heather porter who lives in crockett texas was startled to hear her little boy then 3 say hed been spanked at school porter was never told despite a policy at the public preschool that parents be notified a 3 year old child beaten how the hell can a 3 year old child comprehend the punishment meted out to her him just because they are a little child that is just setting out exploring their world but then again black children are not supposed to explore reach out and learn about the world around them they are supposed to shut up and never be accorded their humanity then again america as a nation has never cared much for the humanity of black girls and boys even when a black child and a white child are both caught doing the same thing in class when push comes to shive or shank the black child will always bear the brunt of the worst punishment it is seen in schools it is seen in the criminal justice system it is seen in the prisons of this country it is seen in how america denigrates and defiles her black citizens per the article not only were black girls and boys paddled more so too were native american children african american students are more than twice as likely to be paddled the disparity persists even in places with large black populations the study found similarly native americans were more than twice as likely to be paddled the study found in states where paddling is most common black girls were paddled more than twice as often as white girls boys are three times as likely to be paddled as girls special education kids were more likely to be paddled
7852124 were sent to missionary schools to further learn the ways of the white man
7852125 the policy pursued toward the indians has resulted favorably so far as can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation through the exertions of the various societies of christians to whom has been entrusted the execution of the policy and the board of commissioners authorized by the law of april 10 1869 many tribes of indians have been induced to settle upon reservations to cultivate the soil to perform productive labor of various kinds and to partially accept civilization they are being cared for in such a way it is hoped as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination i recommend liberal appropriations to carry out the indian peace policy not only because it is humane christian like and economical but because it is right
7852126 there is scant research on whether paddling is effective in the classroom but many studies have shown it doesnt work at home said elizabeth gershoff a
7852127 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
7852128 the practice is banned in 29 states most recently in delaware and
7852129 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
7852130 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

7852139 i was undressing and a guy just came running in and said we need a goalie
7852140 there were three other goalies but their stuff was already off so i guess well they picked me

7852142 what a great opportunity im sure it was exciting for him
7852143 im sure it was fun for him and the boys were trying to get a rise out of him
7852144 all the other kids told me about it right away
7852145 its very cool he was so thrilled when he was coming home he has always been such a big fan of the senators and when they said they needed a second goalie he said for sure yes yes why wouldnt i play
7852146 at first the fingers inside my blocker really hurt the way they were throwing pucks at me and then it was the fingers on my glove hand smacking into my palm really hard but then i got used to it

7852150 a short term outlook and a reliance on quick fixes and fast profits have diluted the curiosity and patience that sustain true innovation and create the potential for future economic growth all sorts of forces from wall streets quarterly profit pressures to worsening government deficits have undermined support for the forward looking research on which future products will depend
7852151 if we as leaders of business do not hold our government officials accountable for the promises they made to increase stem graduates by the year 2015 we will have failed not only our businesses but our country

7852314 im not going to shut up until i buy something for myself so i need to find something to shut me up
7852315 the human brain is always trying to determine why things happen and when the reason is not clear we tend to make up some pretty bizarre explanations
7852316 christians and new agers paranormalists etc all have one thing in common a spiritual orientation to the world
7852317 i believe they do exist but im not sure about this
7852318 i guess we will find out if this is on the up and up
7852319 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
7852320 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
7852321 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect
7852322 that ability to predict the future is what makes humans smart but it also has side effects like superstitions and belief in the paranormal
7852323 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
7852324 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens
7852325 they didnt understand why a child was stillborn or why a drought occurred so they came to believe that such events had supernatural causes
7852326 all societies have invoked the supernatural to explain things beyond their control and understanding especially good and bad events
7852327 in many places even today people believe that disasters or bad luck is caused by witches or curses
7852328 i believe that new orleans had a level of sin that was offensive to god and they are were recipients of the judgment of god for that
7852329 paranormal beliefs are very strongly negatively related to religious belief
7852330 this may partly reflect opinions of christians in the samples who take biblical sanctions against many
7852331 my guess is that religiosity has a lot to do with how you were raised and less to do with genetics
7852332 those people who may have a high genetic susceptibility to faith based knowledge may end up being highly religious or may end up having belief in the paranormal depending on how they were raised those people less susceptible to that method of forming beliefs may still end up being highly religious if they were raised in a religious family
7852333 among christians those who attend church very often and are exposed to stigma and sacrifice within their congregations are least likely to believe in the paranormal
7852334 conversely those christians who do not attend church very often maybe once or twice a year are the most likely to hold paranormal beliefs
7852335 are much less likely to consult horoscopes visit psychics purchase new age items
7852336 however among those christians who do not attend church there is a much higher level of participation in these phenomena
7852337 perhaps amazingly paranormal beliefs are not related at all to education
7852338 ph d s are as likely as loch ness monster ghosts etc
7852339 creatures such as bigfoot and the loch ness monster will one day be discovered by science
7852340 many paranormalists claim that their powers only work sometimes or that they dont work if there is a non believer in the room

7852432 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7852433 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7852434 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7852435 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7852436 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7852437 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7852438 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7852439 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7852440 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7852441 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7852442 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7852443 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7852444 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7852445 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7852675 i clean it about 4 times a day but i have to be careful in the shower because if water gets in it ill die
7852676 the system we have here is not uniquely singapore it is a very common system adopted in practically all countries where we leave such decisions to the local hospital ethics committee
7852677 er hat nun hier in k ln sicherlich eine gro e chance erneut alle von seinen f higkeiten zu berzeugen

7852679 it sounded like they didnt want him to be president
7852680 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7852681 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7852682 clearly we feel that there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified those agencies
7852683 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
7852684 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
7852685 i dont want to say yes i dont want to say no
7852686 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7852687 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7852688 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
7852689 even if it does rhyme with harry potter surely there is a limit to cases
7852690 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7852691 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
7852692 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
7852693 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
7852694 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7852695 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7852696 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7852697 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7852698 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7852699 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

7852708 rather than run a campaign ad at this time the money for its creation has been donated to the shorewood school district for purchase of full time medical staff
7852709 the cost for creation of an ad for this spot has been used to purchase winter clothing for children in schools who have none
7852710 i doubt the majority of expat buyers gave a single thought to the echr or the rights of the legal owners before buying
7852711 when i was a young boy my childhood dream was to become a chimney sweep but i knew you would never sanction such an ambition and i have lived with the failure ever since
7852712 if ever i see you with a sweeping brush in your hands i swear i will kill you
7852713 creo que hubo solo una gran confusi n quien entendi mal quiz s no era en buena fe
7852714 hubo personas que intencionadamente lo malinterpretaron y decidieron especular sobre una iniciativa inocente
7852715 incluso pesadas injurias alguien me dijo que acabar en el infierno

7852732 four bsf jawans were injured in firing by pakistan forces along the loc in the sabzian area of poonch district where their post came under fire from across the border this morning
7852733 one cannot solve problems between countries if they do not talk to each other
7852734 the fight against militancy cannot be won without a comprehensive political strategy devised through a debate in the parliament where the parties with a wide spectrum of popular support come together to own it
7852735 that opportunity is lost with the pakistan muslim league nawaz pml n pulling out of the coalition and the parliament will now be turned into a ring where the two major parties will wrestle for power instead of tackling the security issues
7852736 the insurgents have shown that they can strike anywhere on their will and cause the sort of damage and destruction they want
7852737 it makes the writ of the government almost non existent
7852738 zardari is the only replacement for musharraf that could be acceptable to everyone who wants pakistan to win the war against the militants
7852739 the secular and liberal forces stand united now but they have become extremely unpopular the way they have played their cards especially zardari who publicly admitted that he had violated well documented agreements with sharif
7852740 it can turn out to be a major setback to the countrys war on terrorism
7852741 these islamic parties would try to use a popular figure like sharif to aggravate already existing anti american sentiments in pakistan
7852742 the ppp government will have to take mr sharif on board if it wants to deal with the menace of extremism
7852743 otherwise it will lose the war even before it begins
7852744 in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and of abkhazia
7852745 it is not an easy choice but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians
7852746 on the night of august 8 tbilisi had a choice georgian president mikheil saakashvili opted for genocide with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government
7852747 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards

7852752 i summary of the days breaking news stories delivered monday through friday receive advance notice of xbiz conferences and special events xbiz avi
7852753 it is as the lord of glory said a fixed number of days
7852754 o allah assist us in worshiping you in rajab and shaban and allow us to witness ramadan
7852755 we fear that we will miss the suhur praying behind ubayy and we fear that the fajr time will come causing us to miss the blessed meal they used to refer to suhur as the blessed meal so let our children rush to prepare the meal
7852756 i saw my teachers and some of them would not speak at all in ramadan rather they would only engage in worship either quran or prayer if someone were to speak to them they would count out their words and calculate them by the minutes and seconds
7852757 when i would ask the jinn who i would work with to relay to me any news they would say
7852758 she will not be cured unless she puts on a cross
7852759 you really are devils you are from the disbelieving jinn
7852760 from now we have nothing to do with each other
7852761 i dare you to try to hurt me we will meet at midnight at the graveyard the most secluded and frightening place i can think of
7852762 the brothers in america called asking if you could go spend the last ten nights with them
7852763 subhan allah i spend the last ten nights in america and i leave jalalabad qandahar and kabul erupting the hour in these places is better than standing in prayer for sixty years and i go and enter america even if in ramadan
7852764 ribat for one day in the path of allah is better than a thousand days in any other place even if one were to fast all day and pray all night
7852765 whoever provides food for the fasting person then he will have the same reward as the fasting person without the fasting persons reward being diminished at all
7852766 we wish to provide food for a thousand fasting mujahidin for all of ramadan how much does each mujahid require in ramadan
7852767 the money for the food of two thousand more is on the way feed them rice and meat as they are the best of foods
7852768 our lord descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night asking who will call on me so that i may respond to him
7852769 for me to sit with a group of people after the morning prayer remembering allah the mighty and majestic until the sun rises is more beloved to me than freeing four slaves from the children of ismail
7852770 and for me to sit with a group of people after the asr prayer remembering allah the mighty and majestic until the sun sets is more beloved to me than freeing four slaves from the children of ismail
7852771 a noun a verb and 9 11 guiliani joe biden will crush either one of these contenders in the vp debate if mccain chooses guiliani it would be a match made in a a well it would be

7852787 anchorage alaska federal wildlife monitors spotted nine polar bears in one day swimming in open ocean off alaskas northwest coast and environmental groups say the event is a strong signal that diminished sea ice brought on by warming has put u s bears at risk of drowning or dying from effects of fatigue the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears said kassie siegel of the center for biological diversity the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately the number spotted saturday on long distance swims in the chukchi sea was higher than has been seen in similar surveys

7852802 they are both going to do what they have to do
7852803 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7852804 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7852805 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7852806 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
7852807 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset

7852814 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7852815 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7852816 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again
7852817 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7852818 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and

7852823 there are particular times in the life of the leader of the opposition when you actually have to show some leadership when you have to step up when you have to tell the people of this state what you stand for
7852824 the premiers made very clear what his position is at some political cost the leader of the opposition has to make his position clear too

7852836 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
7852837 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms
7852838 roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
7852839 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet

7852957 the overall objective of our meeting is to define the existence of the womens network and what has been done in the provinces of al jawf and amran
7852958 thus there is the possibility of interaction with these organizations and donors who are interested in community work
7852959 but our country has population clusters in remote areas distinguished by its geographical nature of high mountains arduous passage valleys and wide deserts
7852960 so to hear the importance of such non governmental organizations plays a supplemental role to the efforts of the government which is the guarantor of the effectiveness and continuity of those efforts
7852961 civil society organizations are the main source supplementing the role and efforts of the government they are the closest to the community providing services information and skills which anyone can use to live a better life
7852962 this network was established to unify efforts and strengthen the role of organizations in voluntary work by involving the community especially women volunteers for awareness these volunteers are called social activists
7852963 this great success is the role of social awareness activists and the assistance of usaid and the yphr project for their cooperation in the formation of the network and arrangement of this conference it is a giant step in defining the network and for its continuity and to make further efforts to serve the largest segment of society
7852964 as we know women have a big role in volunteer work that is still understandably difficult in yemen
7852965 the government cannot do all the work so it resorts to involve civil society organizations to complement these actions
7852966 i hope that the womens network has a plan on how to continue and how it can be expanded in other governorates
7852967 we were ignorant of these important things in our lives because we are marginalized in the society so the network comes and makes us aware of the issues
7852968 i used to refuse every vaccination because there were rumors said that it gives diseases and makes you ill but after i examined my thoughts i believe what i was thinking was incorrect thanks to the social awareness activists

7853080 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7853081 we recently concentrated on u s and u k primarily because we see value
7853082 the investment environment is expected to remain challenging with expectations of continued pressure on liquidity and possibly subdued trends in the equity markets
7853083 this may impact temaseks ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio
7853084 the performance to march 2008 while good is not that surprising since the markets started falling in october and there was a strong rally before that
7853085 the challenge is to perform well in the current year as equity markets have weakened since
7853086 citic capital certainly wants to have its own yuan denominated private equity fund as soon as it can following the industry trend
7853087 the nssf is also trying to expand its private equity fund business for high returns as well as to diversify its investments
7853088 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7853089 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7853090 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
7853091 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
7853092 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
7853093 there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability

7853108 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
7853109 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
7853110 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
7853111 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
7853112 in addition aptanas backing of pydev will provide more support and resources for the project and its users alike

7853176 when ministers were appointed they made public and legally binding pledges which are not being fulfilled
7853177 this cannot continue a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for 18 september
7853178 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
7853179 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7853180 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7853181 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7853182 let me make it clear the dup will not respond to threats such as that which sinn fein has made
7853183 if we were to do so on this issue we would be vulnerable to having the republican threat of bringing the institutions down used again and again in order that we would comply with other sinn fein demands
7853184 nor indeed will we make political concessions in order to encourage any party to do that which it pledged to do and carry out duties which it is legally required to perform
7853185 let me deal with the inaccurate propaganda which is being disseminated by republicans about policing and justice the st andrews agreement between the government and the government of the republic of ireland neither bound nor required the dup to accept the devolution of policing and justice nor did it impose any timetable for such devolution

7853224 i think youd be na ve to expect youre going to go out and pull the michigan deal all the time
7853225 there were a lot of circumstances against michigan we played well they didnt play very well i dont think they realized we had that kind of speed lsus a completely different deal we played lsu in 2005 a 24 0 lsu victory they know about us we know about them
7853226 we felt we were deficient in those areas and this was the best and easiest way to go and acquire those things
7853227 but it has become a way of life because of budget pressures
7853228 i dont think were in this business to play people where its a mismatch whether its up or down
7853229 we have all the intentions in the world of playing as hard as we can and ultimately win but the stats are there to prove that 98 percent of the time the i aa team doesnt win
7853230 we use it as an advantage not only with our current team but with recruits theyre pumped up as they can be to play in front of 90 000 people and see how they compare with elite programs
7853231 we have continuously worked towards positioning our hp pavilion range to create relevant offerings appealing to the dynamic market
7853232 and i also think hes a sleeper candidate to be a head coach in the nfl

7853236 be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease
7853237 aids is not an act of god against homosexuals it did not appear out of thin air and it did not come from africa
7853238 the us national cancer institute in collaboration with the world health organization manufactured the aids virus in their laboratories at fort detrich maryland
7853239 the world health organization who called for scientists to work with these deadly agents and attempt to make a hybrid virus that would be deadly to humans
7853240 new scientific evidence suggesting that immunization with the smallpox vaccine vaccinia awakened the unsuspected dormant human immuno defense virus infection hiv
7853241 i thought it was just a coincidence until we studied the latest findings about the reactions which can be caused by vaccinia
7853242 in the relation to the immune response a number of useful experimental approaches can be visualized
7853243 they suggested that a way to do this would be to put their new killer virus aids into a vaccination program sit back and observe the results
7853244 a strong correlation between the proportion of people in different central african countries who consented to the smallpox vaccine program and the proportion of those now infected with aids
7853245 the aids virus must be a man made bio engineered virus
7853246 started to inject aids laced smallpox vaccine vaccina into over 100 million africans as part of its global non european population reduction program in 1977
7853247 if the african green monkey could transmit aids to humans the present known amount of infection in africa makes it statistically impossible for a single episode such as a monkey biting someone to have brought this epidemic to this point
7853248 aids is expected to kill more people and orphan more children than all the wars of the 20th century combined
7853249 more than 70 percent of the people with the virus that causes aids are in sub saharan africa the poorest region in the world
7853250 aids has killed 11 million africans more than 80 percent of the worlds aids deaths
7853251 by the end of this decade asia will be the epicenter of the worldwide aids epidemic host to the fastest growing aids population in the world
7853252 the black men were never told they had syphilis nor were they told their disease could endanger their families
7853253 other doctors in macon county were forbidden to treat any of the men in the study
7853254 many had never seen a doctor much less been treated by one
7853255 the purpose of the study was to record the destructive effects of untreated syphilis and to follow closely the medical progress of the group until each man died
7853256 it was widely believed that black racial inferiority made them a notoriously syphilis soaked race
7853257 the smaller brains of these black men lacked mechanisms for controlling sexual desire causing them to be highly promiscuous

7853408 any literary project reflects the age in which it is written the voice is created for and by a church in great transition throughout the body of christ extensive discussions are ongoing about a variety of issues including style of worship how we separate culture from our theology and what is essential truth at the center of this discussion is the role of scripture instead of furthering the division over culture and theology it is time to bring the body of christ together again around the bible thomas nelson publishers and ecclesia bible society together are developing scripture products that foster spiritual growth and theological exploration out of a heart for worship and mission we have dedicated ourselves to hearing and proclaiming gods voice through this project previously most bibles and biblical reference works were produced by professional scholars writing in academic settings the voice uniquely represents collaboration among scholars pastors writers musicians poets and other artists the goal is to create the finest bible products to help believers experience the joy and wonder of gods revelation this is the first ever complete new testament in the voice translation writers include chris seay lauren winner brian mclaren greg garrett david b capes and others four key words describe the vision of this project holistic considers heart soul and mind beautiful achieves literary and artistic excellence sensitive respects cultural shifts and the need for accuracy balanced includes theologically diverse writers and scholars we have taken care that the voice is faithful and that it avoids prejudice as we partnered biblical scholars and theologians with our writers we intentionally built teams that did not share any single theological tradition their diversity has helped each of them not to be trapped within his or her own individual preconceptions resulting in a faithful and fresh rendering of the bible features include bronze highlighted text screenplay like format ideal for public readings and group studies devotional commentary and book introductions

7853473 everyone worked really hard and we flunked them all you cant blame the teachers and you cant say its one group of kids because weve got three elementaries it looks like its our curriculum
7853474 im going to apply our title i teachers to the fifth and sixth grade and well make sure were teaching to the tests the way were supposed to no one wants to teach to the test but were going to have to do it
7853475 the high school is really making a lot of progress
7853476 we actually just like the term continuous improvement even though thats not our rating because i dont care what your scores are youre always in continuous improvement
7853477 when you get the report card you enjoy it and then start the process of teaching all over again
7853478 its a good measurement because when youre in a district this small one or two students can throw your percentage off drastically and with value added you measure each individual students growth
7853479 it was good for us as was the students staff and the community really buying into the whole school improvement idea
7853480 i think our teachers have really identified our problem areas and been able to address them and theyve been working more closely together
7853481 what we did last year needs to be recognized and there should be a celebration at the high school but we always realize that were starting all over
7853482 we added the center children after center elementary closed in may 2007 so that changed the population and im sure that had something to do with it
7853483 high school science we missed by 0 6 percent which when youre talking about a class of 200 students is essentially one student
7853484 the high school has been excellent for a number of years and im expecting the high school will be excellent again next year
7853485 but we had a 10 percent improvement on our test scores for economically disadvantaged students and we didnt get that designation
7853486 we should be thumping our chests because 26 out of 30 is really good but 28 is very reachable for us

7853503 this is a methamphetamine and firearms case that arose from a traffic stop made by an aurora police officer
7853504 firearms and methamphetamine were seized and a number of individuals are in state custody the matter continues to be under investigation well provide more information as it becomes available
7853505 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7853506 two of the men had tattoos and jewelry popular with white supremacists
7853507 we dont want to let carlisle come here and beat us
7853508 its all about momentum and continuing to win games and hopefully we will do that
7853509 but im really enjoying playing in the middle hopefully i can now start adding some goals its about time because ive only scored about a dozen in my career so far
7853510 the expectation is that qpr will turn us over with the millionaire squad theyve got
7853511 they will be a very good side but it might be a good time to catch them at the start of the season when they might not have fully gelled together
7853512 we can just go there and enjoy ourselves and if we get something out of it thats brilliant we can use it as a test for where we are as a squad these are the teams we want to be playing thats the league the team and the fans want to be in
7853513 we will probably have our backs to the wall at times in the game but its going to be a good challenge its something the lads should be looking forward to and relishing
7853514 i dont think qpr will go thinking its a stroll in the park there is a giant killing aspect with us being in a different league but we are probably closer to them than most people would give us credit for
7853515 i didnt have that much to do but what i did i was quite pleased with
7853516 i would have preferred a clean sheet last week at home but im happy with how things went and how the team played
7853517 i thought we defended really well particularly in the second half when it was backs to the wall
7853518 we werent as clinical with our chances as we have been in the previous games but as a defensive unit we can be happy with a clean sheet our second in four games
7853519 once you start getting to the last 15 20 minutes if you cant nick it the important thing is not to lose it
7853520 weve had a difficult start to the season with so many away games and to still be unbeaten gives us a great unity and something we can build on
7853521 people have to be a little bit patient its a new face and the goalkeeper is a big part of the defensive unit
7853522 for the defenders its a big change from having keiren for the last four years but we are getting better with every game were cutting out the mistakes and learning each others strengths and weaknesses
7853523 ive said before that moving clubs is a bit like changing schools
7853524 but im getting used to it the lads and the staff have been brilliant and having timmo goalkeeping coach dave timmins around is giving me the chance to improve every day and every game thats what i want
7853525 we think very highly of gary at the football club
7853526 he is learning from people like michael bridges and scott dobie who have been around seen it and done it
7853527 gary is getting better all the time and at some stage is going to force his way through that group he is not far away from doing that
7853528 im aware weve got to look after him but at the same time hes champing at the bit and telling me he wants to play
7853529 richard isnt far away but it might be too much for him getting a start
7853530 centre half is a big position he might be ok for half an hour but probably not to start
7853531 if some of the lads need a breather and others need an opportunity ill happily do that
7853532 but make no mistake i want to win this game im not treating the game lightly the guys who will come in are first team people i have said from day one that we will need the full squad this season and you will see evidence of that tonight
7853533 this how much we want and not a penny less

7853539 we didnt want an escalation of the kind of tumultuous behavior caused by the coaching staff
7853540 i told him things like this happen in life and the message is dont give up stay focused and be positive
7853541 i said this is not always going to happen in life youre not always going to be number one
7853542 if you keep these kids on the field you keep them off the streets
7853543 id rather have him jericho in the midst of this controversy on the field than dealing drugs on a street corner
7853544 its really sad because its the children who are going to suffer
7853545 theres no such thing as any kid pitching too hard let him play and your kid is going to get better
7853546 a lot of these kids dont have father figures and we dont want them to end up on the streets
7853547 we want to be a resource for the family and find a place where hell be challenged and his talent can develop

7853558 it proved our lack of european experience and that is why we lost
7853559 i hope we can play well again as we want to improve if we do that then results in big matches like these will come

7853617 despu s de todo lo que ha ocurrido en los ltimos 19 meses el barack obama que conozco hoy es el mismo hombre del que me enamor hace 19 a os

7853621 juntos hemos conocido el xito y el fracaso pero nunca hemos perdido nuestra fe en que estamos llamados a mejorar nuestro pa s y a vivir en un mundo nuevo
7853622 me comprometo a estar el pr ximo enero en el senado
7853623 obama no llevar a nuestros chicos de uniforme a cometer grandes errores

7853625 well just make sure i dont see one no dead mice for me
7853626 i dont know set a trap and then put a paper tent over it
7853627 yes theyll fall for that theyve only been alive a month theyve not yet been around the block
7853628 p they will not fall for that i am not going to put paper tents over a mouse trap
7853629 how about strategically placing or draping some cloth so i cant see this
7853630 p i am not going to do that i will get rid of the mouse but i will not use paper tents you are out of your mind
7853631 fine then i will stay completely out of the garage until this is done its just too gory

7853633 declared him medically fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
7853634 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
7853635 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history
7853636 in fact many people were very impressed to see mr zardari go through the trauma of the assassination of benazir bhutto but still hold himself together hold his family especially his children close to him at this very difficult time
7853637 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
7853638 i mean they spent 9m on 1 goalkeeper when did we spend that kind of money on a player
7853639 we said before the game that it was important to get the win and maintain the momentum we started last weekend against manchester united but is not that easy especially against bolton because you know what you are going to get from them
7853640 they make it very difficult for you and it was a tough scrappy game there was not a lot in it and we have played better and lost before
7853641 it was a tough start playing man u and arsenal in the first three games so it is good to have four points on the board at this stage
7853642 we have something to build on it is a platform and we need to try to keep a run of not losing when we go down to arsenal
7853643 jon s english is good but fabricios is not great luckily my spanish is not too bad i can speak a little so that helps
7853644 they have both settled in well and they are both tough in the tackle
7853645 they are not flimsy in any way they like to get stuck in as well and that is what the premiership is all about sometimes
7853646 especially when you play a team like bolton you have to get fired into them and that is what fabricio did he did not shirk away from it

7853651 there is every possibility of me going a division up for london olympics in 2012 and i will take a call on this matter in the next few months
7853652 i am only 22 and i will grow which means increased weight and a change in my division which is quite okay for me
7853653 i think the entire team that went to beijing needs a break to rejuvenate as much as we enjoyed the grind and the results thereafter there is a need to get ourselves refocused for maintaining the momentum that has been built by our performance in beijing
7853654 the reception has been overwhelming but we have not been able to catch up on sleep amid all this
7853655 you must be the change you wish to see in the world

7853661 these excellent results mark another significant step forward in our continuing drive to be outstanding in all aspects of our work
7853662 i am thrilled that these results show outstanding success for students across the ability range our most able students have also responded magnificently to the opportunity offered to them to achieve success at as level a year early
7853663 it feels really good and im very proud of the work i have done with my dad
7853664 it was quite challenging but my friends were impressed i also enjoy pythagoras theorem and trigonometry
7853665 these issues however are small potatoes compared to the damage that the relationship will sustain if syria uses hizbullah to turn up the heat on israel again with all of lebanon paying the price
7853666 im sorry the house fell through i really wanted it to work out for us too maybe in a few months we can try this again
7853667 we still hope that the dalai lama will stop his separatist activities and in his late years make more contributions to the development of tibet and his motherland
7853668 the door for talks and contact with the dalai side is always open
7853669 imperative for the dalai side to take concrete actions to create favourable conditions for talks and contacts
7853670 as to the specific question on future round of talks please refer to competent authorities
7853671 i seek to apologise to mian nawaz sharif saheb i admit his feelings have been hurt
7853672 as far as judges issue is concerned mian saheb has himself said in his news conference that 10 judges were ready to be reinstated let them be reinstated and the reinstatement of the chief justice will also come eventually
7853673 we are still hopeful that he will accompany us in the democratic journey
7853674 i have been really encouraged by the players over the last few months in particular for the two pre season games
7853675 their commitment and attitude has been exceptional and the worcester game will be a good test for some players who havent featured against either bath or the reds
7853676 we play scarlets next friday at ravenhill and start what we hope will be a successful league campaign so obviously a win against worcester would be a great boost for the players
7853677 they are like us coming to the end of our pre season and gearing up for the start of a big league campaign
7853678 it will be another step up but at the same time what has been good for us in that we are seeing young players coming through who have shown us they are ready for the next step
7853679 senderos has gone to milan today he will complete his medical today
7853680 the thinking is that at the moment he is not getting the games here and goes to a top level club to play
7853681 we have djourou kolo toure senderos song gallas silvestre so there is congestion at centre back with losing him we want him to play
7853682 pushing the matter to raising the issue of visa regime between russia and ukraine which will happen if ukraine enters nato is by far not our choice

7853686 it appears that sales of agricultural commodities produced and sold by farmers in china such as wheat cotton and corn are exempted from the vat
7853687 when these same products are imported it appears that they are assessed the vat at the rate of 13 percent
7853688 but of course hes a friend and i cant say so myself
7853689 more intense more frequent and longer lasting heat waves in the 21st century
7853690 was the 2003 european summer heat wave unusual in a global context
7853691 the tsunami warning had been cancelled 40 minutes later after no tidal wave took place following the quake
7853692 i dont think there is any need for the board to make desperate attempts to organise some cricket in place of the champions trophy as it would be ramadhan
7853693 i dont think we need to beg countries to play against us especially during ramadhan i mean we have international cricket coming up later this year and we have a packed calendar in 2009 as well
7853694 we have a big gap in our international calendar this year due to the postponement of the australians tour and the champions trophy we need to give our players ample exposure
7853695 if afridi wants to take a break he should let us know the same we will only consider those players for selection who are truly committed to the team

7853702 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7853714 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him

7853716 in fact many people were very impressed to see mr zardari go through the trauma of the assassination of benazir bhutto but still hold himself together hold his family especially his children close to him at this very difficult time

7853718 when a sudden change in leadership happens it can surface all the poor planning or lack or planning within an organization

7853792 tim keel writes with the eye of an artist the heart of a pastor the mind of a philosopher and the hope of a visionary his intuitions will inspire your own and his voice will add so much to the conversation about what is emerging in our lives churches and world
7853793 tim keel has written a fascinating and engaging book that will quickly become both a starting point and a standard bearer for thinking about leadership in the emerging church in addition to reimagining the nature of leadership it also offers an implicit and enticing portrait of the type of community that will be formed in response to the vision and values described in these pages in other words if we follow the direction set forth in this volume things will start to look different in the church for many of us thats a reason to hope that this book is widely read
7853794 deeply personal and human in its approach intuitive leadership both charms the mind and informs the heart the result is a wise and gentle tracing of the contours of postmodernism that is as healing as it is liberating
7853795 read tim keels book let it invite you to connect with your stories the markers along the road that have been shaping you so far let it permit you to give voice to your questions lets see how these narratives and the metaphors shaping your life might provide all kinds of clues for the risky ways in which god is calling you to embrace the chaos of our time with hope and expectation thanks tim you resisted an answer book and in so doing invited others to embrace the radical hope of gods future
7853796 erudite eloquent and engaging tim keels intuitive leadership is a landmark in pastoral ministry for he brings together the multiple streams of emerging church postmodernity media theory biblical interpretation church planting cultural studies and holistic missional life this book is destined to be a church leadership classic
7853797 if you think this is your typical leadership book forget about it this book is part autobiography and part ecclesio graphy biography of a church and it is one fine book

7854014 employees said money in their pocket every week is more beneficial

7854127 pydevs popularity in the python community and eclipse ecosystem made it the clear choice for aptana
7854128 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers

7854164 although the major mechanism of bluetongue virus spread is undoubtedly that of culicoides midges feeding on infected ruminants growing the virus and then transmitting it to further susceptible animals other mechanisms may also be at work these may assume greater importance during the midge free season winter such as we in northern latitudes experience

7854167 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
7854168 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
7854169 weve become very good at growing some bacterial species what might be called the weeds of the microbial world
7854170 but many other species cant be cultured by current methods
7854171 although we know now that humans should respect and even cherish their microbial symbionts

7854180 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody strobel said
7854181 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
7854182 this reflects the dollar cost to australians and the human cost to individuals
7854183 governments the food industry the health and education sectors and individuals need to take responsibility for australias bulging waistline
7854184 the factors that contribute to obesity are complex and diverse there are no quick fix solutions and the key to success will be in a multi faceted approach
7854185 it is vital that individuals are not stigmatized but that they are supported and afforded the dignity of what for some can be a very difficult issue
7854186 doctors play a vital role in early intervention but help for our overweight community must be backed up with government intervention public health programs changes to food marketing and advertising food labelling and taxation measures along with urban planning regulations to make leisure options more accessible for ordinary people are all vitally important

7854191 it is clear therefore that calls for higher taxes do not have public support on grounds either of fairness or effectiveness in fact piling more taxes on beer would drive more people away from pubs which remain the safest setting for the social pleasures associated with drinking responsibly
7854192 there are a large number of people drinking at a level that can damage their health many others who are not drinking excessively would be willing to pay more to protect public health

7854234 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and program of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and program regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution

7854262 si a partir de septiembre el senado se va a dirigir por dos fuerzas el pan y el pri que asuman sus consecuencias ellos decidir n qu hacer y si van por un senado divido con el pan y el pri pues que ellos asuman las consecuencias
7854263 ese compromiso dec a que el senado iba a estar dirigidos por tres fuerzas pol ticas y as ha ocurrido los dos primeros a os si a partir del tercero no va a ocurrir as nosotros sabemos ponernos el traje para la corresponsabilidad pero tambi n tenemos toda la experiencia para ponernos el traje de guerrero cuando sea en el senado necesario
7854264 los fuetazos en la cara bueno he consultado y no existe tal acuerdo no se est violando ning n acuerdo entonces no es una posici n que exprese de manera justa y correcta en torno a la gobernabilidad de uno de los poderes de la uni n que es la c mara de senadores
7854265 estamos construyendo las mejores condiciones para que se avance en las reformas pendientes en el pr ximo periodo pero no lo estamos viendo como cotos de poder sino como una situaci n que permita que el senado avance

7854341 what seems to be true from preliminary studies is that the gene variants that were under strong selection reached fixation over the last 10k years are different in different clusters that is the way that modern people in each cluster differ due to natural selection from their own ancestors 10k years ago is not the same in each cluster we have been at least at the genetic level experiencing divergent evolution

7854353 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
7854354 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
7854355 we consider this is a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia

7854389 it is evident by both scripture and reason infinitely eternally unchangeably and independently glorious and happy that he cannot be profited by or receive anything from the creature or be the subject of any sufferings or diminution of his glory and felicity from any other being
7854390 now if god himself be the last end then in his dependence on his end he depends on nothing but himself if all things be of him and to him and he the first and the last this shows him to be all in all he is all to himself
7854391 but god if god be indeed so great and so excellent that all other beings are as nothing to him and all other excellency be as nothing and less than nothing then it is fit that he should value himself infinitely more than his creatures

7854405 having a trained reserve force is of tremendous importance to our nations security
7854406 employers must do their part to ensure that our service members jobs are protected while they train to defend our nation at home and abroad
7854407 the department of justice has a strong commitment to protecting the employment rights of anyone discriminated against because of their military service
7854408 the justice department is committed to seeking and enforcing injunctions against those who promote or participate in tax fraud schemes similarly under the tax defier initiative the tax division will continue to take appropriate actions to stop those who promote and participate in tax defier conduct
7854409 since 2001 the justice departments tax division has obtained injunctions against more than 350 tax fraud promoters and unscrupulous tax preparers

7854411 the web site is a self care solution targeting post deployment adjustment concerns
7854412 individuals who might not otherwise seek out services can now be empowered to use afterdeployments resources at their own pace
7854413 we also recognized that our user population is knowledgeable about computers
7854414 the intent then was to build a site that offered more than just a lot of text based articles we wanted the materials to be interactive we wanted to give users a variety of ways to access the information
7854415 if a user wanted to get a better understanding about their stress level or their anger problem they can take a quick self assessment right on the site and get some immediate feedback concerning their scores
7854416 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the al qaida in iraq network
7854417 iraqi and coalition forces have made great strides in improving security in iraq especially in baghdad
7854418 the second is a declaration on a strategic cooperation between the united states and poland
7854419 this capability will be very important to our nato allies for their security just as its very important for the united states and poland
7854420 as if on cue the iranians just in the last couple of weeks have launched a space launch vehicle which again demonstrates additional capabilities and underscores the concerns we have about the growing missile threat from countries like iran
7854421 its not limited to iran i should hasten to add but its certainly an additional matter
7854422 we also talked about the desire of the united states and poland to pursue cooperation involving air and missile defense cooperation
7854423 well begin those deployments once of course we reach the necessary agreements with the poles and that could begin next year
7854424 and then we set the goal of establishing a garrison for the u s army patriot battery in poland by the year 2012
7854425 its a pretty broad coverage in terms of the subject matter in that document and i think its befitting of the fact that this is going to be a substantially changed relationship between the united states and poland in that you will have a much greater level of defense cooperation
7854426 it became obvious to me 18 months to two years ago that with the retreat of the multiyear polar sea ice the coast guard was going to have to do more than it had in the past to provide maritime safety and security to northern and western alaska the arctic ocean and the beaufort sea
7854427 through the spring and summer weve been conducting a test bed for moving various coast guard units into the arctic environment and determining their suitability for service in northern alaska
7854428 the biggest hazard frankly is ensuring that we avoid sea ice
7854429 and the second issue is that helicopter operations will be constrained because in the arctic we have a concern with the ability to self rescue
7854430 so when you start launching helicopters and sending boats over the horizon you now have to worry about how do you get them back
7854431 for example if i have a ship of a certain size with a certain crew and a certain cargo inbound to new york at ambrose we understand what that means because we know the infrastructure
7854432 we know the traffic patterns we know past history with the company we know all the surrounding information for a vessel contact in much of the world
7854433 in order to project a surface presence in that part of the world for any extended period of time we very quickly realize that because of the weather conditions meaning that even though its more ice free than ever theres still ice much of the year and the distances involved these places are very far away
7854434 the issue of the full function operations the requirement to do everything we do in southern alaska in northern alaska at least seasonally will take several years perhaps up to five years to ramp up to a capability
7854435 and thats why were pushing forward to be positioned and to be prepared to ensure that we dont have a titanic of the north like the motor vessel explorer in antarctica last november
7854436 its very simple these are the people who are protecting our safety and guarding our freedom and anything we can do for them is just a very small token compared to what they do for us
7854437 certainly we can never repay the men and women in the armed forces for all their hard work and sacrifice we do all we can but you can never do enough
7854438 when i got back it was not only as if i had never left but they just showered me with attention and appreciation
7854439 you get a great perspective being in the military not only because you know whats important in life but you are constantly in touch with a culture that values integrity commitment duty and things like that
7854440 and the other thing is you are constantly dealing with all types of people in the military and that helps you deal with your clients as a civilian lawyer
7854441 weve had good experiences with those people they typically have very strong leadership skills are willing and able to accept responsibility and have a proven track record of performance in the military
7854442 anything we do is only a small gesture compared to what the men and women in the armed forces do
7854443 you need to follow through with what you tell us to do
7854444 must be done and work your way down the list dont worry about what does not get done only you and god will know what else you planned to do so that is what i did i was able to focus and get done what god wanted
7854445 itll be just a minute were going to fry some up right now is that ok
7854446 dont tell me youre going to make us wait until next week to find out what to do about the problem youve described

7854481 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7854482 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws

7854509 this man was completely innocent and should never have been charged
7854510 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7854511 some of it is because i challenged the system at guant namo

7854535 this is a big choice for the american people and theyre really going to have to rely on more than a few convention speeches

7854544 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7854545 you know there are thousands of law abiding people living indenver who own rifles and handguns i guess youd be happy to have the police go out and round them up from the information that was reported on the guy who was checking into the hotel it seems very likely that he didnt break the law he made no threats against anyone the weapons were legal and registered our rights do not disappear just because theres a convention in town posted by roy batty

7854633 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7854634 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7854635 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7854636 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

7854659 it is being beaten at the moment through hard work and joined up working but it will become more challenging as the numbers of people working on site increases
7854660 sadly it seems to me that the reality does not match the talk it does not match what people have been promised the number of jobs that will be created or the billions of pounds of public money that have been invested in the olympics
7854661 the current figures are dismal despite the billions of pounds being poured into the construction of the olympic park the numerous training programmes and the huge amount of labour that needs doing the number of people from the east end who have received jobs there remains low
7854662 the olympics project should be raising the stakes it will have no sustainability if local people see 85 to 90 of jobs going to outsiders
7854663 the oda has claimed that there are many local people being employed anecdotal evidence from our local officials suggests otherwise
7854664 sub contractors agencies and gangmasters supplying labour to the site use existing networks or where they can procure workers most cheaply
7854665 looking for any signs of slippage and taking steps where necessary
7854666 when it comes to the crunch these are businesses mainly concerned with their bottom line not regenerating east london sustainable regeneration is not really built into the contracts its not a core requirement
7854667 there are targets for getting local people into jobs but its not clear what will happen if the targets are not hit
7854668 are those being taken seriously i dont think so at the moment and if being held to account then that could be a problem

7854676 winning its what i know i expect it every day
7854677 im going to work hard every day to help us win and thats what i expect out of the players i want to instill a winning culture and lifestyle we have to work hard every day and realize how that will affect our success i think this team will do that

7854686 the arts has to rely on the university itself to support them if we dont get this fee the arts will simply have less support
7854687 we want to keep the performing arts readily available to all students
7854688 my main concern is that it is a tuition increase and in this day and age when kids are struggling to meet the needs of higher education it does add up
7854689 i just dont see right now a lot of kids utilizing those opportunities and therefore i question if the demand is there and if the demand is not there i dont see any justification in raising the fees
7854690 the walls we built on the east side the water never got over them
7854691 it came under and around which was discouraging but our walls held
7854692 the recovery effort to open buildings has been a temporary one a recovery effort to enable the continuity of our academic mission
7854693 were halfway there space wise but time wise there is a very long road ahead
7854694 iowans care about their connection to the land and there is a quiet and unassuming pride born out of an eternal sense of confidence
7854695 the vitality of the city comes from the university and its students
7854696 this wasnt in my job description was it in yours
7854697 we know the river really well so we know where the corners are and we know exactly where we are in the race because we train on the river
7854698 the biggest drawback is not being able to have a fall home race have fans be there and parents come in for that
7854699 its in chicago and we race all the other big ten schools so thats really fun because theres a higher level of competition than in the head of the iowa
7854700 i think if you dont talk about championships within your football team and in your program youre doing your players a disservice and selling them short
7854701 last year every single game we went into we expected to win and i can honestly say we had a chance to win every single game going into the last three or four minutes of the game
7854702 there has been a lot more traffic in the mall
7854703 monday we made a lot more coffee than we used to
7854704 its inconvenient to eat somewhere else im all over the place now
7854705 i liked the location of the bookstore now because it is closer
7854706 plus beat the bookstore is here and we can compare prices
7854707 twenty five of 30 calls from 9 a m to 2 p m turned away because of what we can do
7854708 its a major impact on business because of space by losing the physical space we cannot do as much
7854709 just knowing that the family is hurting and the community is hurting
7854710 i was just expanding the search that was already in progress
7854711 it was a matter of picking up where the guys left off
7854712 it keeps the scent close to the ground ideally the scent is in the air
7854713 there were supposed to be eight women in our room
7854714 one woman got put into permanent housing and another is going home because she was homesick
7854715 the only thing that sucks is that you dont have a sink
7854716 you cant meet people you always have to go out to the hall to meet other people
7854717 you cant open your door so people dont think there are people in here
7854718 i had to work on saturday so i got to my lounge pretty late
7854719 i got the top bunk so that kind of sucks
7854720 these dont have a ladder so i jump from the heater onto my bed
7854721 we always try to get students out of temporary housing by the end of october
7854722 women will most likely have an easier chance of getting out we have a lot more men in housing right now
7854723 i already know people here and i dont really want the hassle of moving all my stuff into another dorm which could be like burge on the other side of campus
7854724 any vaccine that can lower the risk of contracting the disease is worth strong consideration
7854725 i havent ever really heard about it or been through it so i dont really think its that common
7854726 this is the kind of place i seek out everywhere i travel
7854727 they havent tried to spruce it up beyond what it is which makes it endearing
7854728 for a second there we almost had to go into crisis mode
7854729 if the grease doesnt take it down itll be here for another 60 years
7854730 not that many freshmen women knew about the site so were repeating the message more
7854731 thats a big part of making people aware of something
7854732 if everybody is saying the same thing and its repetitive you can create the kind of change im sure theyre hoping to create
7854733 respect is mutual and we want to help open these two way lines of communication as a fundamental part of our campus culture
7854734 if you treat people with respect youre going to reduce incidents of sexual harassment and sexual violence
7854735 the thought was that the time had come to start branding everything a little bit differently
7854736 right now i have out the novelizations of the mummy 3 and the x files 2 that sounds like a sports score
7854737 those kinds of things are a bit more ephemeral that a novel like this
7854738 over the years a sort of mosaic formed from all his stories
7854739 and i realized he had had a really unusual duty and it had resonance for our times he didnt ever remember seeing a black person except maybe once traveling to the iowa state fair
7854740 ill be frank in that i dont know that its a good idea im able to have something famous attached to my name with road to perdition and red sky isnt getting any of the benefit of that
7854741 well now youve got to move to new york or hollywood and i just said why
7854742 i didnt understand that why a writer cant write anywhere
7854743 i found myself in the middle of it shooting video being immersed in the whole thing
7854744 textbooks are important but nothing can compare to seeing something firsthand
7854745 i hate you from the very bottom of my soul

7854752 my father worked for a south african insurance company in the then federation of rhodesia and nyasaland and we travelled to and lived in tiny outback towns
7854753 in the old days it was important to look after wildlife but now we have so many critically endangered species it is so easy for a whole species to be wiped out
7854754 they have their own businesses but they do spend a lot of time on thula thula
7854755 i grew up in the bush and if you live in it you see a huge different over half a century i was prompted by my time in baghdad
7854756 in less than 100 years the earths survival potential has deteriorated to a point where we must now consider that man himself could one day become an endangered species
7854757 the charity is going really well we have seven countries involved at the moment
7854758 what we try to do is focus on something that we can actually complete we want to train people on how they can change a situation
7854759 our main job at the moment is getting people to join the organisation and we encourage members to be active even if its small
7854760 to find a rifle and shoot the lot in all my years in the african bush and in conservation i had never seen wildlife in such wretched condition
7854761 the us army has spent about 2 5million upgrading the zoo and park in the last two years
7854762 and there is a new plan to extensively renovate it to 1st world standards from what i have seen it has really improved
7854763 i think the reports say that they havent seen the rhino and there is speculation that they may be extinct the garamba reserve is extremely big and finding a handful of rhino not at all easy i hope that this is the case that they are there but have not been found
7854764 the un proposal is going along and we are tracking its progress and there is a lot of work to do lots of lobbying and it needs support
7854765 but its been in the pipeline for a while the writers strike put everything on hold for a while
7854766 wherever there is a situation where i can make a difference to raise awareness of the dire straits of the plant and animal kingdoms and the environment and to make a positive difference through positive action and example
7854767 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7854768 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders
7854769 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7854770 driving at such excessive speeds on roads such as the a702 is highly dangerous and poses a very real risk to other road users
7854771 we hope that the initiative that has taken place this weekend shows that this kind of activity will not be tolerated

7854773 open and frequent communication between parents and school staff is a key ingredient to keeping food allergic students out of harm it takes a partnership to establish effective avoidance strategies and emergency plans

7854810 it appears that sales of agricultural commodities produced and sold by farmers in china such as wheat cotton and corn are exempted from the vat

7854812 he refuses to do a book so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography im trying to paint a realistic picture of who my father is i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy yeah my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that the osbournes almost discredited who he is as an artist my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

7854821 this place is holy to the jewish people and we have a duty to be here
7854822 the whole land of israel belongs to us and we should not be afraid to live wherever we want to the arabs must accept that
7854823 we are connected to the water grid we have phone lines from the national company bezeq we have been hooked up by the electricity company and have street lighting
7854824 we also have a kindergarten paid for by the state and a group of soldiers stationed here to protect us how can we be illegal
7854825 we can also see all the arabs from here and keep an eye on what they are doing
7854826 and in addition we can see the other settlements and check on their safety
7854827 they are very afraid that this will become simply the first of many settlements to fall
7854828 the settlers know that preparation of an alternative site could take years
7854829 the danger is that migron will be destroyed only to be resurrected in legalised form by the government as a new settlement close by adam
7854830 we believe it is possible to find a solution for the outposts that will strengthen the settlements
7854831 it would be a big mistake if we give up what is rightfully ours

7854850 while economic development is alive and well throughout kankakee county i am a bit perplexed by the fact that many of the contractors and workers are coming from outside the area
7854851 we need local jobs for local people who get paid area standards with good benefits only then does economic development benefit the entire community and county and not a select few
7854852 i will say that to you and to anyone who comes into this village
7854853 the accusation is dangerous defamatory and blatantly untrue victoria takes her position as a role model to young women very seriously and is horrified by this hurtful fabricated story it is now with her lawyers
7854854 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting
7854855 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
7854856 technique and how to ideas have taken the place of deciding what it is exactly we want these children to learn
7854857 but i have nothing against the technology if its in the service of grown ups facing their responsibilities to decide what the students need to know precisely if they did that these technical gadgets will be valuable
7854858 it gives kids a chance to use things they already use in real life and make that connection in school
7854859 we did have to take a hard line approach to that
7854860 you can restrict all kinds of stuff and you can drive yourself nuts trying to police all of it they culbreth are probably kind of opening themselves up to something
7854861 these teachers say this pilot signals their commitment to our students to meet them where they are as opposed to where the teachers are comfortable
7854862 they state their commitment to teach 21st century skills because technology is the future for students and teachers
7854863 this is gonna be a good thing im really thrilled

7854922 the council will support the bid the land is there and we have been working with team ipswich about this over the years to get something done
7854923 there is a very strong cycling ethos in ipswich and the council is very strong believer in having a cycling centre here
7854924 the crusade against bleaching has taken tinu to virtually all the nooks and crannies of the united kingdom it is aimed at discouraging or completely eradicating the spirit of bleaching among africans she is more concerned about the health implications associated with bleaching and that is why she goes around the uk to let the people believe in the colour of their skin
7854925 i am out on the streets against bleaching because of the experience i had when my very close friend was admitted for operation in an hospital she did not survive the operation because she had been bleaching for over 15 years according to the gps report after the operation which was very successful they found it difficult closing her up after the operation because her outerskin layer hadbeen destroyed due to long years of bleaching because of that she died it was a painful loss in fact i am yet to overcome that loss that is just one out of very many tragedies occasioned by attempts by africans to want to look like europeans they forget that god gave them that skin colour because of the weather and made the europeans white because of their weather
7854926 black africans still see bleaching as the in thing in town i am yet to see any white man who wants to change his skin to black and that is why i have taken it upon myself to alert blacks on the dangers inherent in bleaching
7854927 the war has to start from here because africans resident here are largely influenced by what they see they see the whites and they want to look like them in colour forgetting about the health hazards associated with such things
7854928 i have africa the continent of the blacks in mind in the next couple of weeks i will move my campaign there because that is where we have the largest population of blacks but as they say charity begins at home nigeria my country will be my first port of call
7854929 we will need the support of government organisations highly placed individuals for the success of the crusade and it is my prayer that at the end of the campaign against this social abnormality the blacks will come to the understanding of the dangers inherent in bleaching there is dignity in the black colour because it is a special gift from god and any attempt to want to tamper with it is an indirect way of being ungrateful to god

7854958 thats why i want to help them out there are a lot of players who go to belgium for example and have had terrible experiences i know players and they have come to me we need to make sure they have more support and that will make their families happier because they know they are being looked after
7854959 the foundation i hope will be a big organisation covering lots of different areas and whatever help the players need then we can direct them in the right way and give them the best a talented footballer comes over his family depends on him and if his agent or club dont treat him well he might not succeed and then he feels hes let everyone down for years african players have been exploited i know a lot who have suffered and the foundation is going to have a big responsibility

7854974 so i took a rope and a chair and ascended the stairway into the attic of my home i fastened the rope securely to a rafter in the roof then stood on the chair and fastened the other end of the rope around my neck
7854975 standing on that chair so lonely and brokenhearted i was about to leap off when suddenly the loud ringing of my doorbell downstairs startled me i thought ill wait a minute and whoever it is will go away
7854976 i waited and waited but the ringing doorbell seemed to get louder and more insistent and then the person ringing also started knocking loudly i thought to myself again who on earth could this be nobody ever rings my bell or comes to see me
7854977 i loosened the rope from my neck and started for the front door all the while the bell rang louder and louder when i opened the door and looked i could hardly believe my eyes
7854978 there on my front porch was the most radiant and angelic little boy i had ever seen in my life
7854979 then he gave me this gospel tract that i now hold in my hand as the little angel disappeared back out into the cold and rain i closed my door and read slowly every word of this gospel tract then i went up to my attic to get my rope and chair i wouldnt be needing them any more
7854980 you see i am now a happy child of the king and since the address of your church was on the back of this gospel tract i have come here to personally say thank you to gods little angel who came just in the nick of time and by so doing spared my soul from an eternity in hell

7854992 if california voters reject the amendment banning gay marriage it will be the first and only state where voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage

7855123 both mr balanchine and jerry robbins worked in paris at different points during their careers and they both loved the city a great deal
7855124 i am thrilled that the opera has invited the company to return to this wonderful city which is so important in the history of ballet and i am honored that we are the first international company ever invited to perform on the stage of the opera bastille
7855125 it has been a long time dream to have new york city ballet dance at the paris opera where george balanchine created le palais de cristal and to have this ballet performed at the gala on september 18 by both nycb and paris opera ballet dancers in the american version known as symphony in c will be especially exciting and meaningful

7855154 while the web hosting industry does not view social networks as a threat to its business people are going to functional hosts for services that allow them to share information online this demonstrates that there are opportunities for web hosts to tap into consumers who embrace social networks but these opportunities are being overlooked by the very industry that knows the internet best
7855155 its important that as the web hosting industry moves forward we understand that internet users are seeking a customized personalized internet experience for both personal and professional reasons ultimately its about customer relationships providers and resellers need to work together to provide the support services and infrastructure that give users the best experience

7855167 information technology pros will go extinct if they dont start thinking about their jobs differently more
7855168 the information which the accused had given to caroline amounted to disclosing serious illegal insider trading activity and also raised great concerns about the fire and the insurance
7855169 carolines possession of this information was potentially very damaging to the relationship between the accused and rene rivkin a relationship which he valued very very highly
7855170 sometimes he gets so angry its like he wants to kill me
7855171 hes under a lot of pressure sometimes i fear for my life with gordon
7855172 the only reasonable explanation for his knowledge is that he was there when she went over
7855173 weve been very clear what the stakes are and what were looking for
7855174 i think that really communicates pretty clearly what we have suspected which is that theres no interest by the liberals to have a conversation about a legislative agenda for the fall
7855175 whats the rush the meeting is to be about the fall sitting of parliament the house doesnt return till sept 15
7855176 there is no crisis except the one being manufactured by harper weve never been told there was a time limit for this meeting other than it was to happen before the house reconvened
7855177 the facts dont support conservative spin that parliament doesnt work in fact harper is manufacturing a crisis when none exists three federal budgets have passed twenty nine bills have passed
7855178 were not asking for a blank cheque weve asked to have a conversation about what on the governments agenda if anything would you be willing to support so we can have a productive legislative session in the fall
7855179 the answer is theyre not even willing to have a conversation let alone agree on anything
7855180 it stretches all credibility to say that one doesnt have time in a three week period to take a phone call
7855181 if really in six weeks you cant get any agreement public or private you cant even have a conversation privately i think you have your answer
7855182 were not really optimistic about mr harpers wish to change direction
7855183 we dont have confidence in this government weve been opposing their policies and voted accordingly in the house of commons

7855192 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7855193 given that bats are far more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue

7855196 i hold marcus in very high esteem and he is a strong character guy miller said
7855197 this has been a horrible situation for marcus and we are in the middle of this horrible process of trying to figure out a best avenue for marcus while we are in that process its incumbent of me to respect that process and his privacy
7855198 we feel that we owe that to him tillman said while acknowledging it was unusual to have a player involved in the process
7855199 we are going to talk again monday and he will have a voice in what we decide we owe that from what he has invested in this club and the community
7855200 he came upon a beautiful escarpment of coloured rocks something he hadnt seen before and went over to have a look maybe strayed off the track a bit and some huge lizards came out
7855201 wild animals had attacked him and he was covered in wounds
7855202 flies had bitten him he ended up with maggots in his wounds which is a good thing people are saying but they ended up laying eggs in the good layers of the skin as well
7855203 he has several medical problems all interacting with each other and has a long way to go
7855204 both he and lynne are very happy with the care he is receiving and the australian embassy has been very supportive
7855205 its better news because its been a couple of terrible days

7855208 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7855209 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7855210 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true

7855236 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7855237 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7855238 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states
7855239 they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7855240 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines
7855241 then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7855242 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7855243 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7855244 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach

7855260 at the same time it introduces us to the works of guy ben ner that humorously but critically engages the everyday dramas of real life
7855261 real life draws connections between two very different artists who share a common interest in a direct hands on approach capable of bridging the gap between experience and our reflection on it in this neither ron mueck nor guy ben ner stray very far away from real life in artistic process or content as they work to diffuse the boundaries between art and everyday life

7855324 the avma believes proposition 2 standards for confining farm animals is admirable in its goal to improve the welfare of production farm animals however
7855325 proposition 2 may have negative impacts on animals consumers and the industry if its passed
7855326 we fully agree that more attention needs to be paid to the behavioral and social needs of food animals and proposition 2 is laudable in that it attempts to address these needs but the standards in this ballot initiative fall short in improving animal welfare because they fail to adequately consider other factors
7855327 animal welfare is a complex issue and demands that decisions be based on science
7855328 due to busy schedules many consumers are eating at non traditional meal times

7855335 is it a moderate financial crisis or is it a really serious financial crisis
7855336 if its an honest to god systemic crisis you should not touch financials now or really until current equity holders are more or less wiped out

7855351 i think even the bcci office bearers will agree that dilip has made a huge difference in his professional approach by first making it mandatory to become a selector for both senior and junior level even though the payments to the selectors norm was in the pipeline for a long time dilip took the initiative to impress the big wigs in the board to implement it i am sure this will only benefit the future selection procedures as every selector will be accountable to every decision he takes during a selection committee meeting
7855352 the bcci s new selection system passed last year mentions that a selector s tenure can be extended by a year if required dilip who has done a fine job has been at the helm for just two years and i will not be surprised if his tenure is extended by a year because he richly deserves it
7855353 moreover dilip has been instrumental in giving lot of youngsters their due most of these youngsters have done remarkably well and a case in point is india s triumphant debut in the world twenty20 championships in south africa where young unheard of cricketers became overnight superstars so i strongly feel that he should continue for one more year

7855383 this is particularly important given the fact that advertising money is being pursued by their immediate telecom competitors consumer device manufacturers such as nokia and internet related companies like google yahoo myspace and microsoft

7855529 theres a really important discussion going on about how to think about the economics of climate change the key player is marty weitzman who has made a simple point albeit using very very difficult math thats nicely summarized at env econ

7855548 they suggest about a 5 percent chance that world temperatures will eventually rise by more than 10 degrees celsius that is world temperatures will rise by 18 degrees fahrenheit
7855549 we simply dont have enough data to absolutely preclude a sensitivity that unlikely but the tail is a lot thicker on the positive side than the negative
7855550 roughly ten thousand times larger than the probability of a large asteroid impact
7855551 its a proud day no states have ever done this before
7855552 its a huge huge deal that we got this done
7855553 you americans live to work we filipinos work to live
7855554 i also think the 5 probability for 10 degc rise is also a scientific absurdity
7855555 a man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to leave alone
7855556 we have no way to know what the absolute surface temperatures were more than 1 million years ago and our knowledge of historical co2 levels is limited to order of magnitude estimates
7855557 climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
7855558 listen up you ghgs stop absorbing infrared radiation and stop accumulating in the atmosphere and oceans this is economics talking we were discovered way back at the dawn of the age of steam so we therefore naturally rule that goes for you too thermodynamics adapt to economics or else
7855559 if everyone had settled for an amish lifestyle wed possibly not got into this present mess
7855560 the guy seems to need to be reminded that economics has been studied and examined much more and for much longer than climate change hence it makes more sense to me that climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
7855561 really economics is the study of the entirety of human interactions
7855562 the guy seems to need to be reminded that economics has been studied and examined much more and for much longer than climate change hence it makes more sense to me that climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
7855563 is there a definitive answer to computer climate models are what they really mean for modelling the recent past and the future with any degree of accuracy
7855564 everyone carries a part of society on his shoulders no one is relieved of his share of responsibility by others and no one can find a safe way for himself if society is sweeping towards destruction therefore everyone in his own interest must thrust himself vigorously into the intellectual battle
7855565 the persistent communities i make in my computer model clearly work very well ill therefore take one of these communities and try to rebuild it from scratch using only the dozen or so species that make up the community
7855566 any attempt to impose large amounts of short term pain will inevitably face strong opposition because people will stop believing in agw as soon as it is no longer in their interest to do so
7855567 maybe if we ignore the environment it will just go away
7855568 in real life minimum wages hurt far more poor people than they help
7855569 but none of that changes the laws of physics or economics
7855570 after all the dinosaurs flourished for 50 million years or more without ice wouldnt we be better off without it too
7855571 the national center for atmospheric research an important hub for work on the causes and consequences of climate change has shut down a program focused on strengthening poor countries ability to forecast and withstand droughts floods and other climate related hazards
7855572 in a context of a return to a free market just changing that one policy would be all skewed up we are far from capitalism and free market in this culture anyway because of progressive taxation and designed government driven inflation with relentless increase of the government sphere we are lumbering through social democracy on the way to out and out so cial ism frayed word because it triggers spam detectors seems to march along no matter which party is in power must be what we want as opposed to what we made our revolution about 225 years ago
7855573 i dont want anybody to obstruct my lust for power
7855574 the cultivation of self interest and encouragement of private profit is not essential to economic efficiency an individual desire to be of service and to increase the wealth of the whole society can be an equally strong motivation work does not need to be seen as a necessary burden but as a desirable activity with physical social and spiritual significance and benefits allowing each person to have a recognized role and to make a constructive contribution to society just as the total productivity of an ecosystem is the sum of the net productivity of each organism within the system so does each incremental contribution of some good or service add to the total wealth of the community
7855575 some experts have pointed to climate change as a factor
7855576 and the average soil temperature in areas around the caves has risen by two degrees centigrade since 1982
7855577 market forces are really terrible for dealing with environmental problems
7855578 the us did its level best to destroy democracies in any country that had anything valuable
7855579 nothing adapts fast enough to make this a smooth transition its going to be very messy
7855580 but then you took it to ridiculous and silly extremes shows again your interest is in lambasting capitalists not improving economies
7855581 the trade theory assumes that we send apples to australia and they send something else to us presumably something that they can produce more efficiently than apples
7855582 why the heck didnt that get taught in history class i wonder
7855583 just an observation if you would look for info other than in your butt you wouldnt say things like
7855584 market forces are really terrible for dealing with environmental problems
7855585 the us did its level best to destroy democracies in any country that had anything valuable
7855586 im the ceo of a big company with a large workforce turnover so i must get much more money
7855587 capitalism is a primary cause of most of the problems we face not a wise solution that secures a sustainable future
7855588 usa caused the overthrow of 75 democratically elected governments since ww2
7855589 the chief executives of americas 500 biggest companies got a collective 38 pay raise last year to 7 5 billion thats an average 15 2 million apiece
7855590 has it escaped your attention that the worst pollution on record happened in the ussr and eastern europe neither of which could be remotely called capitalist the black sea is a sewer vast swaths of forest are gone and half a century after the chelyabinsk waste dump exploded its still radioactive central planners can be just as bad for the environment as capitalists
7855591 in a post marxist world looking for deliverance is there a better way
7855592 the needs even the survival needs of persona must never be a legal claim on
7855593 as acknowledged in 151 above wont canada russia and other northern nations who have vast lands of fertile soil but it is too cold there to grow important crops suddenly become enormously important
7855594 central planners can be just as bad for the environment as capitalists
7855595 to be interdependent as we inherently are is not to be slaves to each other
7855596 lack of awareness of the basic unity of organism and environment is a serious and dangerous hallucination
7855597 some rob you with a six gun some with a fountain pen
7855598 having an infinite number of players is not repeat not the definition of a free market
7855599 so even if there is only one manufacturer of a pant de farter as long as people are informed about the item it exists in a free market
7855600 climate change is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen and it interacts with other market imperfections
7855601 i didnt say the existence of supply and demand curves made a free market
7855602 mark you are maintaining that unless a market is a perfect free market
7855603 for your minimum wage scheme to work the supply and demand curves would have to be the same curve that can only happen in a command economy and the us is no closer to that than it is to a pure free market
7855604 ill readily stipulate that the labor market is not perfectly free but the supply curve is still up with price and the demand curve is still down with price
7855605 when the last cooling cycle resumed 800 years ago the greenland wheat farmers simply walked away from their farms
7855606 wont canada russia and other northern nations who have vast lands of fertile soil but it is too cold there to grow important crops
7855607 for the period from 1900 to 1980 142 of the 144 glaciers retreated
7855608 the evidence presented here unambiguously shows that five of the six major tributaries that formerly nourished the disintegrated portions of lis have recently experienced important dynamic perturbations this includes not only the detected acceleration and retreat 16 but also an active surging
7855609 accelerated ice discharge in the west and particularly in the east doubled the ice sheet mass deficit in the last decade from 90 to 220 cubic kilometers per year
7855610 between 1997 2004 annual mean sea ice concentration has decreased by 17 mean ice thickness has decreased by 0 9 m or 36 ice volume decreased by 40 which is gt 2x the rate of ice area decrease if this trend persists the arctic ocean will become ice ice free by 2013
7855611 america was once a paradise of timberland and stream but it is dying because of the greed and money lust of a thousand little kings who slashed the timber all to hell and would not be controlled and changed the climate and stole the rainfall from posterity and it wont be long now it wont be long
7855612 33 1 or about 303 089 000 hectares of united states of america is forested of this 34 4 or roughly 104 182 000 hectares is classified as primary forest the most biodiverse form of forest
7855613 the second largest continuous area of forest in the world the central african rainforest
7855614 if all countries of the world could eliminate or virtually eliminate deforestation as canada has done this would have an impact comparable to eliminating fossil fuel emissions in the united states in terms of advancing ghg mitigation efforts
7855615 the government of british columbia has dramatically increased logging in an attempt to slow the spread of the beetle by removing recently infested trees and to recover value from trees already killed
7855616 democracy and economic planning the political economy of a self governing society
7855617 it is obvious that economic growth is ultimately unsustainable especially given the narrow capital based definition used to define the term
7855618 the delta of the great colorado river where once it swept into the gulf of california used to be the most wonder filled wetland in the whole north american continent some 400 species of plants and animals including jaguars beaver and the worlds smallest dolphin thronged its 3 000 square miles of wetlands lagoons and tidal pools the local people made a good living fishing its teeming waters now it has become a forbidding desert of salt flats and giant heaps of dead clamshells the fishing boats have been long since beached the destitute people have to seek what work they can in wheat fields and tortilla factories far away
7855619 the worlds great rivers are drying up at an alarming rate with devastating consequences for humanity animals and the future of the planet
7855620 in tropical areas hydropower reservoirs may be much worse climate polluters than even coal power plants
7855621 deficiencies of neoclassical microeconomics that depends on its wildly inaccurate picture of human decision making its fixation on equilibrium phenomena and its cornucopian assumptions about natural resources

7855624 ideas are not truly alive if they remain locked in a single mind our need to transfer them to others focuses us to consider why and where we want them to go and how we want them to get there
7855625 who would have a seat right next to the field and not come
7855626 oh im sorry dont you have anyone else to come with you a brother or friend
7855627 it would be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7855628 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
7855629 there has been this decline in the number of loans approved in the last six months it is down to a very quiet housing market and partly driven by people not wanting to borrow in the context of house prices falling
7855630 i havent read the paper today or seen the internet
7855631 do we have a quarterback it seems like chris mortensen is making the decision on our quarterback for our football team but nothing has changed
7855632 one thing i learned from former steelers coach bill cowher is you dont want to make an emotional decision based on a half of football
7855633 look weve put in a lot of work and its based on a body of work we dont have to make that decision right now
7855634 were going to work on the things from the tape and correct it and when we do make a change of that magnitude im sure you guys will know about it
7855635 habr algunos seguidores de la senadora clinton con quienes tendremos que trabajar duro para persuadirlos de que suban a bordo eso no es una sorpresa

7855640 ojal ch vez hubiese recorrido a pie las veredas de la bombilla
7855641 ive played piano sung and written various things plays short stories etc since i was a kid but never officially started songwriting until my first band mason dixon
7855642 weve been really lucky getting great musicians to play with us
7855643 right now we are working with lizzie carena who is a talented vocalist dan loomis a very respected jazz bassist and my cousin kevin duda on drums who is a great player and a fantastic addition to the band
7855644 i usually start with an idea which could be a lyric melody character setting emotion news story whichever one i start with i then work to build the other elements around
7855645 when it came time to record working with jim was a no brainer i really respect him and learned so much about recording from him
7855646 which is a big theme in the songwriting its also my middle name so it makes the project feel intimate to me
7855647 as de la rosas suitors will find out you dont get jo without her ex fiance slade
7855648 when the idea to film the recording of my debut single for the show first came up the producers jumped at the chance to go one step further and have the song air in front of an international audience
7855649 as de la rosas suitors will find out you dont get jo without her ex fiance slade
7855650 i feel comfortable amongst international contemporary tastemakers including zero 7 royksopp and 4hero
7855651 ive been the teen girl sensation and group member solo r amp b pop diva the fashion ing nue and progressed every step of the way as a songwriter and artist whether im in or out of the spotlight as a progressive minded veteran artist i have taken my own path
7855652 im a pretty simple down to earth person in that i live for my music and work really hard for it
7855653 when i think about the musicians whove inspired me they have the same philosophy im talking about people whove been able to create something meaningful for 20 plus years despite the odds artists with real longevity
7855654 im still very close to my mother even though we live so far away from each other now
7855655 she gave me a great foundation first of all just with how to approach the music side of things and second just with the morals and responsibilities and hard work that come from doing things right i come from a working class family and that drive that persistence will always be part of my nature
7855656 settle for the safe ordinary path that was available which likely wouldve meant hanging up music to spend the rest of my days in some factory or shop back in ireland or take a chance to realize a dream
7855657 im not going to pretend it was fun to get up there and try to win over total strangers
7855658 but it taught me a lot about how to connect with people ive always been inspired by great singers who are also amazing storytellers people like bruce springsteen tom petty stevie nicks and melissa etheridge and listening to them has taught me that you cant be a true storyteller without that connection
7855659 for me its always been about the big questions what is this song ultimately going to mean to someone
7855660 when i look at some of the other singers out there the ones who are just in it for the short term or the party aspect of this whole experience or the ones who are just singing someone elses words i suppose my only response would be im not like those other girls
7855661 i watch that show all the time and the next thing i know im hearing my song on it
7855662 when youre holed up in the studio for months at a time theres always that sense of self doubt that worry that no one will hear this stuff and youll fade away but when you get back onstage it all comes together and you finally get the chance to see the impact youre making
7855663 there are a couple of themes that run through the album evolving around the many different aspects in relationships whether it is loss of love not wanting to be in love trying to help a friend through their own issues unrequited love and the happiness and excitement of being in love
7855664 i mostly like to write my lyrics from a personal point of view but have found it was also useful to write from a storytelling side as well i have observed situations and made them into my own little stories like short films i love writing and performing and cant wait to start playing for all the people that have showed their support
7855665 i hate my sister she ruined the whole family she is so spoiled why cant they discipline her i try to help amp i always get hollered at towards the end now i have lead poisoning in my hand amp every one hates me
7855666 unfortunately im in an industry where diversity is not celebrated the way it should be when some people see and hear something different it feels foreign to them and they dont like that everyone has a choice of what they like and thats a beautiful thing
7855667 record labels managers publicist journalist media ect sic have a tendency to see something work and try to reciprocate that with another artist thinking thats what makes success to me what makes success is letting people be truly who they are
7855668 im not her and never will be im no sister im just my god given name
7855669 its not surprising the biden book has done well but publishers were not ready for it
7855670 the shipping time on amazon is one to three weeks which means theyve run out of books and are waiting for the publisher to have more printed and delivered to them
7855671 customers tend to browse at brick and mortar retail stores
7855672 online purchases are driven much more by publicity hits and search
7855673 marketing is targeted at customers and isnt trying to trick customers into buying books if they wouldnt like them
7855674 there are so many books out there on so many topics publishers are always looking for a way to call out their product and get the attention of the masses
7855675 it was a stiff competition that needed extra driving skills to beat the field
7855676 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain

7855680 frank marshall davis alleged communist was early influence on barack obama
7855681 although identified only as frank in mr obamas memoir dreams from my father it has now been established that he was frank marshall davis a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the communist party in the 1950s
7855682 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama
7855683 was chatting with him davis that late autumn afternoon as dunham and barry obama approached
7855684 its possible he briefly went back to indonesia before actually starting at the school
7855685 frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7855686 bridges of course always denied party membership and attempts were made to deport him because he was a communist he was born in australia but he was able to fight back because he had very very sharp shyster lawyers and a lot of friends in the u s government that helped him and they prevented his deportation but he had been a major force promoting communism
7855687 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
7855688 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
7855689 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
7855690 left himself some wiggle room not least i suppose because of the possibility of prosecution
7855691 many of the requests were sequential and systematic that is 135 article requests in test record for j mech design 80 article requests in journal of pressure vessel technology 56 article requests in journal of dynamic systems measurement and control in addition to 0 requests from various journals were downloaded consecutively and within short intervals access from the ip range 129 252 86 83 to publications of american society of mechanical engineers international hosted on scitation has been temporarily suspended

7855702 as muslim student association msa chapters have become increasingly influential at universities and colleges around the country critics have charged that it is a hate group that sympathizes with the international jihad and promulgates an anti american and anti semitic ideology in its campus actions
7855703 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
7855704 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university

7855895 interest in python has been steadily growing and got a big boost earlier this year when google announced that python was the language for google app engine google is also a worldwide licensee of the commercial version of pydev pydev extensions which includes even more high productivity features for python developers
7855896 this has been a great year for the python developer community with the advent of great frameworks such as django and deployment solutions such as google app engine now the tooling is getting better all the time one of the great tools is pydev especially if you are eclipse minded having aptana take on pydev only means progress for that project and python developers
7855897 pretty much anyone these days who is creating web sites and applications is using offering pydev as an extension to aptana studio and therefore eclipse will make it even easier and faster for pydev users to create test deploy and manage their web applications
7855898 in addition aptanas backing of pydev will provide more support and resources for the project and its users alike

7855927 america cannot afford a third bush cheney term which is what a mccain presidency would be

7855929 the nomination is decided we have a vice president we will work together to go forward every convention has its areas of disagreement to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7855930 our families cannot afford four more years of stagnation and failure
7855931 the easy path of aging is to become a thick skinned unbudging curmudgeon a battle ax to grow soft and sweet is the harder way
7855932 europe should try to take steps to ease russias withdrawal from the security zones which are a real sticking point for moscow
7855933 russia doesnt want to retreat from areas in georgia proper that can serve as a staging area for the georgian military so thinking about how to make the sarkozy plan stick anything the european union can do to separate the forces and create a cordon sanitaire for diplomacy to proceed would be a step forward
7855934 the e u always has trouble speaking with a single voice
7855935 it will find consensus all the more difficult in this crisis in central europe theres a sense that we told you so russia is again an aggressor state and in western europe there is a much more complicated view of the war in georgia and an unwillingness to jump to the conclusion that its time to man the barricades and contain russia

7855937 after analysing the wtcc technical rules we felt that the tdi could deliver good results and when last years championship got complicated we didnt think twice about facing the difficult challenge of developing the car in such little time the results have proved our initial analysis to be correct and were extremely satisfied with the wins and our innovative contribution to the championship

7855988 in the case of individual scholars receipt of a competitively awarded fellowship or grant is certainly an honor and usually a sign of worthy past achievement and of scholarly promise the winner of such an award deserves recognition by that scholars employer but past achievement is past and scholarly promise is not scholarship the fulfillment of promise becomes apparent only with the completion of a project usually a manuscript or publication some grants may also be awarded to individuals or groups for projects that disseminate scholarship and that result in program development civic engagement community outreach or innovations in teaching in these cases too it is the results that count not the means to achieve the results i think we all know senior scholars who have received fellowships for specific projects but who failed to complete them i once had a colleague who received a coveted guggenheim to finish a book he never did grant monies in the humanities are notoriously tight and the major competitions receive many hundreds or even thousands of applications every year this means that in a given year large numbers of high quality deserving applications are rejected should a scholar who tries for a prestigious grant and narrowly misses out or is named an alternate be penalized in the same way as his her colleagues who never even bother with grant applications more generally counting grants in this way seems to be part of an ongoing effort within many institutions of higher education to quantify as many features of an academic career as possible in the process of evaluating faculty members for merit raises and promotions the professional division believes that unchecked quantification should be resisted in the historical discipline and in the humanities as a whole where evaluation of scholarship is of necessity largely qualitative how a fellowship or grant should count in a dossier should necessarily vary with the scholar the project and the goals of an institution

7856060 the new dispensation of collaboration across the political divide should now see us single mindedly devoting our energies towards the recovery of our economy
7856061 happily all political parties in the country have acknowledged culpability in this violence
7856062 we will not attend the clear message is that the dialogue is still under way and we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded

7856064 you are tuned into the von madd datalink netowrk im your host ed jackson and for the next four days we will be providing you with non stop coverage of the first annual von madd beach volleyball tournament so sit back put your vibrating experiments on pause and start picking your favorite beautiful players now
7856065 joining me is the lovely dr allison parker you may know her as the efficient project leader of the mechanical restraints division but did you know that dr parker played beach volleyball in college i bet you were a dominant player of that game dr parker
7856066 please call me allison ed i have to say i was a terrible player i kept getting distracted by the net i thought it would look much better wrapped around my opponents
7856067 ha ha maybe if we play our cards right today we might be able to net us a beautiful woman today
7856068 there is certainly no lack of beauty today ed the weather here at the beach is simply gorgeous we have a slight breeze coming in from the east and there is not a cloud in the sky the bleachers are jammed with sexy players and even sexier staff members if i do say so myself the handsome dr von madd himself is sitting in his vip box sipping a pina colada i think the women surrounding him with fans are a nice touch
7856069 dr von madd is laid back with his mind on the game and the game on his mind for those of you who may be unfamiliar with beach volleyball we prepared a little rules break down for you allison would you do the honors
7856070 certainly beach volleyball is a game between two teams of two players each a ball is bounced back forth over a net and if the ball lands on a teams side of the net the other team scores a point the ball can not be touched by the same player twice in a row and it can not be touched by one team for more than three touches before being returned to the other side play continues until one team scores fifteen points and has a two point lead theres other bits but i suggest you do your own research
7856071 well put dr who are the first players for today
7856072 first up is laura marie and victoria sage versus sassa ekwall and annika thorsen
7856073 shes swedens number one player she trains on snow last year she was ranked fifth in the world yeah shes fucking good
7856074 it looks like every one is wearing the same swimsuit i wonder why
7856075 who cares i bet its some sort of swimsuit theyre testing lets just go out there and have some fun
7856076 sure they might be better than us but really how much better can they be
7856077 holy shit allison the swedish team is really demolishing their opponents
7856078 i know ed the swedish team has scored four times in a row with barely any sort of defense from the americans the swedish team is just too powerful and fast this is what happens when a better team is completely in control of a weaker opponent
7856079 you know when you put it that way you make a massacre seem sexy
7856080 i was just told after the match started about the penalty lasers
7856081 the lasers go into effect at the five point mark if a team scores five points then the other team loses their tops at ten points they lose their bottoms its give the losing team encouragement to play better i have also been given this card to read to you hold on
7856082 von madd laboratories would like to assure you that the lasers were designed to only ignite the special material in your unique swimsuits the lasers are harmless to human flesh though it is not advisable to stare directly into a laser while it is being fired please also do not run from the lasers as the beam might strike an audience member and result in premature declothification
7856083 we cant play with our tits flying out for every one to see
7856084 i at least have done it before yeah its humiliating but ive had a year to get over it the question you should be asking is can ms sweden over there play like this can her partner can they keep playing know that they are about to flash all of their colleagues
7856085 i cant believe it allison the swedish team just seems lost out there victoria and laura have scored twice on them now
7856086 i have to agree ed i dont know if its lauras big tits flying at them on every spike or if it is the fear of losing their own tops but the swedish team is really distracted out there what ever the reason the americans are really pounding the swedish team now
7856087 allison you say the sexiest things the score is five four and victoria runs forward for the surprise spike b cups take to the air and score its laser time and the crowd goes wild
7856088 you know now they are going to play harder now to avoid losing their shorts
7856089 thats okay both teams know something that we didnt know before
7856090 its laser time again allison annika thorsen is butt naked for the von madd datalinks audience apparently the swedish women prefer not to shave
7856091 thats not all ed apparently annika is not a natural blonde either
7856092 ed check out laura working the crowd the girl thinks shes a cheerleader did she just do a cartwheel
7856093 allison we are at match point the score is 14 8 and the swedish team is looking tired
7856094 they also look very pink their tournament assistant should have rubbed their tits and butts down with suntan lotion i dont think annika knew she was nude sunbathing today they are looking a bit burned down there
7856095 speaking of burning allison the team of laura and victoria are on fire the girls might have their tits to the wind but they seem so natural out there
7856096 youre right ed these girls have declared war on the swedish team and they dont give a fuck about neutrality
7856097 umm allison i think you might have reached a little on that one

7856113 clearly such details should never have been included in the hard drive of the computer offered for sale on ebay we fully expect mr chapman to hand it back to graphic data as soon as possible we will of course work with graphic data to establish how it came to be available for sale on our site
7856114 environmental factors such as stressful life events may trigger an anxiety disorder more easily in people who have a genetic predisposition to the illness
7856115 previously addiction to benzodiazepines has been explained by reference to negative rather than positive reinforcement in other words the thinking has been that the reason people continue to use the medicine is that it helps to alleviate their distressing withdrawal symptoms and general discomfort rather than because it provides a sense of reward
7856116 our studies have shown that diazepam also affects the dopamine system which adds a new positive reinforcement mechanism of reward learning to the theory of benzodiazepine addiction
7856117 i was immensely relieved when the doctors and nurses explained to me and my wife that rapidarc treatments focus just on the tumor
7856118 earlier technology for radiotherapy limited the number of angles we could use for striking at a tumor
7856119 with rapidarc technology we are seeing excellent treatment plans that permit us to target the tumor from nearly every angle in a 360 degree circle around the patient the impressive thing is that when we use rapidarc to target the tumor from more angles we can deliver a treatment using less radiation and it only takes two minutes
7856120 the vast majority of our patients since then have had no complications following treatment
7856121 i couldnt imagine how we would improve on that but with rapidarc we have we can get the same results two to eight times faster than was possible with our earlier technology
7856122 whereas we generally treated four patients each hour rapidarc is making it possible for us to treat up to five patients an hour with plenty of time in between appointments having extra time for administrative tasks will help us ensure that charges are captured correctly and cut back on time consuming billing errors
7856123 ive been pleased with the thoughtful and efficient care ive been getting at image guided radiation therapy
7856124 im in the treatment room for only about five minutes per session because i live so close to the care center im only away from home about an hour each day the doctors told me that i was one of the very first patients in the northeast to receive treatments using this technology i think its wonderful that people are inventing these devices its a miracle as far as im concerned
7856125 i thought regular exercise and common sense would suffice i would happily sink a pint or three wolf steaks sausages and bacon sarnies
7856126 this success is tribute to the hard work of our staff in emergency treatment departments across lothian
7856127 cutting waiting times is a clear priority for this scottish government to ensure patients get the treatment they need as quickly as possible it is also important that they have a clear understanding of when they can expect to receive their treatment and our new ways of publishing waiting time statistics does just that
7856128 the unprecedented levels of transparency offered by the new system means patients are no longer at risk of finding themselves banished to a hidden waiting list
7856129 todays statistics released by isd scotland show an overall impressive performance from the nhs in scotland effectively meeting all our challenging national maximum waiting times targets
7856130 this is very good news for patients but it is not the end of the story
7856131 sexual health services need to be accessible and available at short notice long waits for help could be hazardous where sexually transmitted infections are involved and it is good to see that our service has done well in this test
7856132 we will have to live with whatever goes here for the next 100 years or more it would cast a shadow on the planning system if there were not to be a public inquiry
7856133 if it then goes ahead a lot of people might still be unhappy but at least it would have gone through due process
7856134 this is an absolutely enormous development theres no doubt something needs done with the gap site because its such an important part of the city but this development is not the way forward
7856135 we feel we have met the required standard in terms of the economic and social case and dealt with the issues to do with heritage and up till now the council and the government have agreed with that position we see no need for a public inquiry
7856136 as the market leader in hormonal contraceptive products bayer schering pharma is especially committed to enabling people to carry out conscious family planning

7856138 usaid has provided commodities for family planning and reproductive health activities since the mid 1970s since then contraceptive and condom use rates around the world have increased thanks to usaid and other international donors
7856139 usaid welcomes bayer schering pharma and its commitment to providing safe reliable oral contraceptive pills to hundreds of family planning programs worldwide in support of usaids global mission

7856143 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status

7856145 the american association of clinical endocrinologists aace is pleased to endorse the 1st world congress on interventional therapies for type 2 diabetes
7856146 aace recognizes the need for interventions that are proven to be safe and effective in the management of type 2 diabetes aace looks forward to participating in this very important scientific meeting which will critically examine the potential role for surgery in treating type 2 diabetes and other related metabolic disorders
7856147 i am excited about the collaboration between endocrinologists and surgeons
7856148 together along with other leading experts in diabetes and public health the congress will examine the emerging role of surgery not only as a therapy for type 2 diabetes but as a means to shed light on the causes of the disease the lessons we are already learning from studying gastrointestinal surgery have tremendous implications for the same future of medical therapies of diabetes
7856149 surgery has arrived like a comet across the firmament of diabetes and obesity unexpected brilliant with great promise for the future
7856150 teams of talented researchers are moving ahead to define the role of surgery in the treatment of both of these scourges
7856151 teasing out the agents responsible for the beneficial effects of gastrointestinal surgery on diabetes may lead to new discoveries and provide targets for new medications or even less invasive interventional therapies
7856152 this new surgery is an exciting option for severely overweight patients who do not respond to diet exercise and drug therapy we hope to show that like other weight loss operations the toga procedure will help them to lose weight and improve their health
7856153 the benefits of an endoscopic approach are less pain quicker recovery shortened hospital stay and decreased complications as well as a lack of scarring
7856154 eventually toga may also be an option for patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo more invasive surgery
7856155 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7856156 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7856157 in this study weve uncovered a previously unrecognized role for tumor capillary cell mechanosensing and contractility in the formation of irregular tumor vessels and have identified potential new targets for vascular normalization therapy that might be implemented in the clinic someday
7856158 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7856159 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7856160 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7856161 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7856162 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7856163 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7856164 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7856165 grading the states a report on americas mental healthcare system for serious mental illnesses
7856166 this is a landmark event in the evolution of focused ultrasound surgery
7856167 although there has been significant work done around the world in the field for a number of years it isnt until you see it all come together like this that you begin to understand the true potential of this technology to meet the challenges of modern medicine with less invasive and more effective treatment
7856168 mrgfus 2008 will highlight both current and potential future uses of mrgfus and will provide the most comprehensive and authoritative update of this highly promising technology this will help physicians realize the potential of mrgfus in mainstream medicine this meeting will be a great opportunity for the whole field to work together to accelerate the pace of development and collaboration for mrgfus
7856169 mrgfus 2008 will be extremely helpful to the field to date researchers using and developing mr guidance of focused ultrasound have had to meet a various other meetings be those in the field of mri or therapeutic ultrasound having a unified meeting will allow for all the newest information and development in this combined research field to be shared in the most efficient manner for us mrgfus is an extremely important technology we are presently developing new applications for therapeutic ultrasound that will take advantage of all the benefits that an mr guided system has over other systems including those for treatment planning optimization and validation of therapy our ambitious goals for these applications would not be technically feasible without an mr guided system
7856170 mrgfus has the potential to be an important interventional tool which has low morbidity and high efficacy
7856171 this sort of focused meeting is how mri started a generation ago this could be as big or bigger for stroke thrombolysis it could be the most important meeting in the country the pieces are coming together for the breakthrough techniques of the next decade mrgfus 2008 will be the place where critical mass is achieved and the solutions start to take real shape
7856172 mrgfus is an extremely important development as a neuroradiologist i have a major interest in stroke mrgfus could totally revolutionize the treatment of acute stroke by liquefying the thrombus the mrgfus 2008 meeting is very important for issues such as reimbursement the more users of mrgfus we have the sooner we will get category i codes for reimbursement
7856173 mrgfus is already very important in some areas of medicine and can become very important in neurosurgery because of the minimally invasiveness of this tool mrgfus could be used in neurooncology neurovascular and functional neurosurgical cases one of the most attractive features is the possibility to eliminate the need of radiation therapy and its unwelcome side effects mrgfus 2008 will be a very helpful meeting because more physicians need to be aware of mrgfus technology

7856237 dont worry youll be fine its ok to be nervous weve all been there
7856238 you want to set it on the table like this proc
7856239 this is like an event i want that kind of presence
7856240 its very complimentary its not like an actor people see on tv who is playing a role im the same here or on tv or whatever and people feel like they know me ive been on the air for so long that i have people coming up all the time
7856241 dont kid yourself its nice to have feedback its nice to know people are watching it would be very hard to be this excited this enthusiastic about what youre presenting if you never knew that anybody watched and appreciated
7856242 everybody needs a pat on the back or a well done you know its so easy to do that but so few bosses take the time to do that you know just pass you in the hall and go hey thats a good article you wrote last week well done that takes what five seconds its nice when youre on the receiving end of that
7856243 thats because i stay home when im angry or frustrated or tired or sick or whatever you are rude to one person and people go you know he seems so nice on tv but in person he didnt even say hello or anything so when you step out of the house or the office you gotta be prepared to give and give and give and give they want you to stand up have your picture taken with them you do it what would i have said no 1 thats not a good thing to do under any circumstances 2 if you said no 500 people would have known that by this afternoon
7856244 this is a typical huell howser story i didnt even know i was on the simpsons i got home on a sunday night and there were 50 different messages on my phone starting in the east coast and wrokin their way west were sitting here watching you on the simpsons falling off the couch laughing i get in the office the next morning and call matt groenig and said this is huell howser and there was this quiet on the other end of the phone because i knew he thought i was calling in upset i said if youre gonna do a parody of me i could use the money and the exposure you gonna continue just let me be my own voice next time
7856245 ive gotten lots of keys to cities drawer full of keys i dont have pasadenas key to the city though i dont think these keys carry any particular clout i think if youre stopped for speeding that doesnt help
7856246 i was stopped once for speeding goin 75 85 miles an hour on the grapevine toward bakersfield guy pulls me over i give him my license and he goes oh my gosh my wife isnt going to believe that i got to give you a ticket everybody else would have said huell my wife and i watch you all the time on tv slow down next time get on your way no he wrote out the ticket and the whole time he was writing it he was relaying his favorite stories that he and his wife had watched over the years so it didnt help at all that i was huell howser i just made the experience friendlier and nicer for him but i still got the ticket
7856247 what is so bizarre is that i can walk in here as somebody who is known from television i walked in here everyone knew who i was a heart surgeon who had just left huntington hospital and successfully operated on a child and saved her life could walk in here and not a single person would know who that heart surgeon is that puts it all in perspective
7856248 its pretty safe to say then you wouldnt be able to name the most amazing thing youve seen because everything is equally amazing in its own way
7856249 youre one of the few people who has ever figured that out thats a compliment to you spending the day in south pasadena with a woman who grows roses and takes them to the local post office to share them with everybody how do you compare that day with a day going to the top of the golden gate bridge no two experiences are the same theyre all part of life
7856250 ive made a list of 20 places my favorite 20 places in california and its going to be a 2 week vacation where my sister and her husband come to california and get my urn full of ashes and go to these 20 places staying in the best hotels eating at the finest restaurants and at each place they leave a piece of huell ive got it exactly mapped out
7856251 sounds like it would be a good 14 15 part pbs special
7856252 yeah i could see that i could live beyond the grave at least for a miniseries
7856253 how do you talk about suffering with people who are in the midst of it
7856254 gets about 144 results a ratio of 2 700 1 maybe we get so focused on the most recent year or two of rising prices for products like eggs that we lose sight of the longer term historical trends
7856255 right at the time oil prices are skyrocketing were struggling with the economy were concerned about global warming and national security threats remain intense we wake up and weve got this abundance of natural gas around us
7856256 ive watched the vmas in the past and the presenters are always like these mega stars like jamie foxx jennifer garner

7856262 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7856263 lidea pi assurda e ridicola come se io potessi mai trovare il modo di esistere senza aver bisogno di te
7856264 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
7856265 faceva parte della bugia amore mio non sono mai riuscito a cancellare lagonia il mio cuore non batteva da quasi novantanni ma stavolta andato diversamente non lo sentivo pi al suo posto cera un vuoto come se ti fossi portata via tutto ci che avevo dentro
7856266 la morte che libato il miele del tuo respiro nulla ha potuto ancora sulla tua bellezza
7856267 gt gt mormor e riconobbi i versi pronunciati da romeo sulla tomba di giulietta
7856268 non esattamente sono io stessa a darmi fastidio il mio volto cos facile da leggere mia madre dice sempre che sono un libro aperto
7856269 al contrario per me tu sei molto difficile da leggere
7856270 ho detto che sarebbe meglio che non diventassi amici non che non voglio
7856271 sarebbe pi prudente che tu non diventassi mia amica ma sono stanco di costringermi ad evitarti bella
7856272 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
7856273 credo che i tuoi amici siano arrabbiati con me perch ti ho rapita
7856274 no pi che altro sorpresa a cosa devo tutto questo
7856275 telho detto sono stanco di sforzarmi di starti lontano perci ci rinuncio
7856276 si rinuncio a sforzarmi di fare il bravo dora in poi far solo ci che mi va e mi prender quel che viene
7856277 e se non fossi il supereroe se fossi il cattivo
7856278 non dovresti trattare cos le persone non per niente corretto
7856279 abbacinarle in quel modo per fare colpo probabilmente corsa in cucina a cercare di riprendere fiato
7856280 e dai non dirmi che non ti rendi conto delleffetto che fai
7856281 non te ne sei accorto pensi che chiunque sia capace di fare quel che desidera cos facilmente
7856282 non ridere se te lo chiedo ma come fai a uscire di casa quando giorno
7856283 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
7856284 sei davvero convinta di piacermi meno di quanto io piaccia a te
7856285 si mi vuoi rispondere o si ne sei davvero convinta
7856286 probabilmente no ma allultimo momento avrei cancellato linvito avrei finto una malattia o una caviglia slogata
7856287 immagino che tu non mi abbia mai visto in palestra ma pensavo che avresti capito
7856288 ti riferisci al fatto che non sei in grado di camminare su una superficie piana e solida senza inciampare
7856289 e il crepuscolo per noi il momento pi scuro della giornata lora pi leggera ma in un certo senso anche la pi triste la fine di un altro giorno il ritorno della notte loscurit fin troppo prevedibile non credi
7856290 a me la notte piace se non ci fosse il buio non vedremmo le stelle b non che qui si vedano un granch
7856291 avevo paura perch per ecco ovvi motivi non posso stare con te ma daltro canto vorrei stare con te molto molto pi del lecito
7856292 si non c dubbio una paura legittima voler stare con me e tutto fuorch una scelta vantaggiosa
7856293 avrei dovuto lasciarti perdere tempo fa dovrei lasciarti adesso ma non so se ci riuscirei
7856294 il che precisamente la migliore ragione per andarmene ma non preoccuparti sono una creatura troppo egoista desidero troppo la tua compagnia per comportarmi come dovrei
7856295 bella arriverei a odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male non hai idea di che tormento sia stato il pensiero di te immobile bianca fredda di non vederti pi avvampare di rossore di non poter pi cogliere la scintilla nel tuo sguardo quando capisci che ti sto prendendo in giro non sarei in grado di sopportarlo ora sei la cosa pi importante per me la cosa pi importante di tutta la mia vita
7856296 sai gi cosa provo ovviamente sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire piuttosto che rinunciare a te sono unidiota
7856297 sciocca correre per me un gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
7856298 non prendertela con te stessa se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
7856299 e domani sar pi difficile ora sono assuefatto alla presenza costante del tuo odore se ti resto lontano troppo a lungo mi toccher ricominciare da capo non proprio da zero per
7856300 stavi dormendo sodo non mi sono perso niente i discorsi li avevi gi fatti
7856301 ma cosa devo fare con te la prima volta che ti bacio mi assali la seconda mi svieni tra le braccia
7856302 a vedere una partita di baseball non mi sembra che tu abbia pi tanta voglia di giocare ma sono certa che gli altri si divertiranno anche senza di te
7856303 non sono mai arrabbiato con te come potrei esserlo sei sempre cos coraggiosa fiduciosa calorosa
7856304 ci che mi fa infuriare limpossibilit di proteggerti dai rischi la mia stessa presenza un rischio per te a volte mi odio dal profondo dovrei essere pi forte capace di
7856305 ti amo e una giustificazione banale per quanto faccio ma sincera
7856306 bella bella smettila ti preoccupi per le cose sbagliate credimi se ti dico che nessuno di noi rischia niente sei gi abbastanza sotto pressione non caricarti del peso di preoccupazioni superflue ascoltami la nostra famiglia forte lunica paura che abbiamo quella di perderti
7856307 edward rimasto solo per quasi un secolo ora ha trovato te dopo tutti questi anni passati assieme a lui certi cambiamenti non ci sfuggono e lui diverso adesso pensi che avremmo il coraggio di guardarlo in faccia per i prossimi centanni se ti perde
7856308 lo so bella credimi lo so e come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
7856309 ci credi se ti dico che malgrado tutto quello che ti sto facendo ti amo anche io
7856310 per aver rischiato di sparire dalla mia vita per sempre
7856311 non ce lho con billy e suo figlio a irritarmi
7856312 prima di tutto mi ha costretto a violare la mia promessa avevo promesso che stasera non ti avrei mollata neanche per un secondo
7856313 grazie ma c dellaltro ha detto che sei carina il che praticamente un insulto stasera sei molto pi che bellissima
7856314 di nuovo il crepuscolo unaltra fine ogni giorno deve finire anche il pi perfetto
7856315 non proprio pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
7856316 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
7856317 e allora preparati alla fine preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
7856318 se la vita ti offre un sogno che supera qualsiasi tua aspettativa non giusto lamentrasi perch alla fine si conclude
7856319 mentre li studiavo il pi giovane dei cullen alz lo sguardo e incroci il mio e stavolta la sua espressione era evidentemente incuriosita mi voltai di scatto e allora mi sembr di notare che il ragazzo fosse stranamente sorpeso quasi deluso
7856320 per un interminabile istante il silenzio fu assoluto poi iniziarono le urla in quel pandemonio sentivo gridare il mio nome dappertutto ma nitida in mezzo al frastuono vicina al mio orecchio udii la voce bassa e affannata di edward cullen
7856321 bevitori di sangue la tua gente li chiama vampiri hai la pelle doca
7856322 e sbagliato e rischio bella io sono pericoloso ti prego renditene conto
7856323 anchio te lho detto non mimporta cosa sei e troppo tardi
7856324 sedevo l il viso cinereo e gli occhi sbarrati un uccellino ipnotizzato dallo sguardo di un serpente
7856325 non avere paura prometto giuro che non ti far del male non avere paura per favore perdonami sono capace di controllarmi mi hai preso in contropiede ma adesso ar impeccabile
7856326 e stato a quel punto che hai rischiato di morire schiacciata nellincidente proprio sotto i miei occhi
7856327 si accucci con il volto appoggiato dolcemente al mio petto ascoltava il mio cuore gli sfugg un sospiro non so per quanto tempo restammo immobili in quella posizione ore intere per qul che mi sembrava sapevo che avrebbe potuto perdere il controllo in qualsiasi momento e la mia vita sarebbe finita l eppure non riuscivo a provare paura sentivo il contatto con lui e non pensavo ad altro
7856328 corsi alla finestra laprii e mi sporsi nelloscurit della sera a scrutare le ombre impernetrabili degli alberi
7856329 dammi solo un minuto per rimettere in moto il cuore
7856330 incrociammo i nostri sguardi attenti la sua espressione si fece pi rilassata ma allo stesso tempo perplessa
7856331 e poi nel sonno ti ho sentita pronuinciare il mio nome tanto chiaramente da farmi credere che ti fossi svegliata ti sei rigirata nel letto hai mormorato di nuovo il mio nome e sospirato quel momento mi ha sbolrdito e segnato ho capito che non avrei pi potuto ignorarti
7856332 non mi sembra affatto giusto io non ho dovuto aspettare nemmeno un seccondo perch dovrebbe andarmi cos liscia
7856333 hai ragione dopotutto sei soltanto costretta a rischiare la vita ogni secondo che passi assiaeme a me e non un granch ti tocca soltanto voltare le spalle alla natura allumanit cosa vuoi che sia
7856334 pochissimo non mi sembra di dover sopportare una gran rinuncia
7856335 e sei preoccupata non perch stai per conoscere una famiglia di vampiri ma perch temi che questi vampiri non ti approveranno giusto
7856336 la musica rallent si trasform in qualcosa di pi morbido e con grande sorpresa
7856337 vuoi che blocchi le uscite cos potete massacrare gli ignari cittadini
7856338 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
7856339 avrei dovuto lasciarti tempo fa dovrei lasciarti adesso ma non so se ci riuscirei
7856340 il che precisamente la miglior ragione per andarmene ma non preoccuarti sono una creatura essenzalmente egoista desidero troppo la tua compagnia per comportarmi come dovrei
7856341 non esserlo non solo la tua compagnia che amo non dimenticarlo mai non dimenticare mai che sono pi pericoloso per te che per chiunque altro
7856342 vorrei vorrei sentissi la complessit la confusione che provo vorrei che potessi comprendere
7856343 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
7856344 e dward theres something that i want to do before im not human anymore
7856345 t ell me what you want and you can have it bella

7856348 i thought we were excellent we really should have won we dominated the game for about 80 minutes and we created a lot of chances i think we had that spark that we were missing last time against bohs ive told the players if they play like that week in week out i can have no complaints
7856349 hes a dogged hockey player and a smart hockey player
7856350 he can make plays at top speed he can play the wing or center ice there is nothing not to like about him
7856351 everybody comes to camp to compete for a job and hell have to do the same thing
7856352 hes been one of the best college hockey players in the country he was a first round draft pick those are the things that build the expectation and i think he has those expectations for himself but it does come down to how he does in september
7856353 hes got a good chance to be on our club next season
7856354 he has a great chance to be a top six forward in the nhl
7856355 there are obviously high expectations for him and hes really committed to getting great results
7856356 hes already a tall guy almost 6 4 and having seen the commitment he has made to getting bigger and stronger is great to see for a guy who has all the skill and talent
7856357 hes a creative forward centerman mostly hes got real good skating legs our scouts are really high on him
7856358 hes one of those guys that wasnt real big when we drafted him or even going into first pro year but he is making great strides the second year of pro will be a great challenge for him those guys that keep getting better and bigger and stronger have a chance
7856359 he didnt have a great season last year in london but he had the good tournament
7856360 i think hell have a great couple years in london and really develop and be ready to turn some heads in a couple years
7856361 he had a disappointing year and he would be the first one to admit it now
7856362 he needs to have a great summer and go back to get back to the level he was at hes a skilled player a scorer and not very big only 5 9 160 pounds so he has to be strong and explosive maybe he expected things to happen on their own after having a great year those small guys need to keep beating the odds all the time
7856363 im really excited about his first year after the draft
7856364 he had a big role on a team that went to the frozen four he played first power play unit and had just a great year hes a competitive kid a smart hockey player with good instincts he plays with an edge and his skating has improved this kid wants to be a hockey player and thats the passion and drive were looking for
7856365 we see a power play we see a lot of good things it was a real good pick for us it fit what our need was
7856366 we dont have to worry about him committing to strength and conditioning program
7856367 hes a bull strong as an ox he just needs some more hockey under his belt going back to notre dame next year will be good for him hes a great prospect
7856368 hes a small guy and he needs to know he has to be strong
7856369 he might be quick and explosive enough for college or world junior stage but to do that in the nhl is different so he needs to get bigger and stronger
7856370 he came to our development camp so hes committed to getting stronger
7856371 he knows what he needs to do i think were really pleased with what we saw in his first year i think hes a great prospect
7856372 he has a great attitude and hes a great kid
7856373 he plays solid defense hes not flashy but a competitor and a real good team player hes a classical defensive defenseman who takes care of his own end and battles hard
7856374 when you have young goaltenders they just have to play
7856375 the more they play the better they are now we give him a chance to play

7856379 the beijing paralympic games are going to take place shortly after that talks will take place between chinese government and the representatives of the dalai lama keeping both these in view security cannot be relaxed at the embassy
7856380 as of now we dont plan any protests or campaigns anywhere in the city but we are conducting meetings and any action would be taken only after that
7856381 the state government has failed to a great extent to control the violence by the vhp the police was not taking any steps to control the mob
7856382 if the state cannot ensure the safety of its citizens the central government should deploy the armed force there we cannot allow the anarchy to continue
7856383 the christian community in india abhors violence condemns all acts of terrorism and opposes groups of people taking the law into their own hands
7856384 whatever steps are required to maintain peace and harmony in all areas of orissa to prevent further attacks on christians and to arrest those responsible for the deaths of saraswati and his associates
7856385 it is a reflection of the fascistic mindset of these organisations that they could attack a place housing innocent unprotected children
7856386 the communalists have been emboldened because of the support being extended by the bjp a coalition partner in the orissa government
7856387 the current spate of violence against christian clergy religious institutions including churches and service organisations such as orphanages is part and parcel of the sangh parivars larger conspiracy to turn state after state into a hindutva laboratory
7856388 all right thinking people irrespective of political and religious affiliation should join hands to stop this communal frankenstein who is out to tear apart the nations fragile secular fabric
7856389 it is a blatant lie and calibrated disinformation propagated by the organisations whose contribution to the nation was just chaos and destruction

7856393 i hear you had a little trouble here on wednesday
7856394 i would have been here sooner but my driver got lost
7856395 when we launched u pass last year ubc o students asked for transit service between vernon and kelowna
7856396 we are pleased the vernon regional transit system is putting the service on the road and were sure that students as well as commuters and shoppers will see the benefits of transit for themselves
7856397 im not the kind of guy who gets stressed out easily but i am starting to get a bit worried about where im going to stay i plan on being in kelowna on september 1 to be ready for school and may have to stay in a motel for a while until i can find something
7856398 there is a real housing crunch in kelowna right now and a lot of our students are dealing with the situation there is currently no space in our residences and housing in kelowna is scarce and expensive
7856399 once the particles are deposited into the lungs they tend to accumulate theyre basically like ultra fine shards of glass that penetrate into the lung tissue and the body tries to attack it but it cant break them down
7856400 i dont want to see them in subdivisions i would like to see them in places where there is going to be a mine which is technically what gravel pits are they would have to comply with all the mining regulations
7856401 what that allows the developer to do is actually comply not with the regional district guidelines for developing land but with the mines act for gravel pits which have far fewer regulations so in effect by getting a mines permit the developer can dive under the rules set by the regional district to protect the environment
7856402 it may mean that we will have to pay more for gravel but at what point do we want to safeguard peoples health
7856403 the parking and road improvements are all part of the ground work that needs to take place before the terminal expansion begins
7856404 the people that attended our event were people that really needed the extra help during the back to school season it was so rewarding to see that our community made a difference

7856415 i went through two box sets with over 20 cds to pick songs that felt good and would work well melodically for the saxophone

7856420 all about giving your man whatever he desires no limits
7856421 on august 9 a series of storms over the south okanagan resulted in a total rainfall of 48 3 millimeters in a single day that was a record breaking day in of itself
7856422 right now penticton is sitting at a total rainfall amount of 85 4 millimeters and the forecast for the next week is cool and unstable so there is a decent chance the record will be broken
7856423 to win one of these is few and far between you gotta enjoy it as much as you can its so bloody painful i had to work a little harder than i thought i would have to
7856424 it was always my aim to come back here and try to defend my title as soon as the gun went off at the swim i smashed in i held on for dear life on the course there were parts of the marathon that were very ugly but coming back it doesnt matter how you feel because the crowd takes you home its amazing
7856425 to ensure a full turnout of voters for the critical permatang pauh by election
7856426 i dont see why a public holiday is needed as the by election is exclusively for the permatang pauh constituency this declaration must have been a political decision
7856427 clearly reducing the voter turnout will affect the election results as it may be seen as favoring one party over the other
7856428 what was proposed was that in our low season or down time that we could out of compassion help out some of the sailboats but the houseboats no we are not built and cannot handle houseboats
7856429 what was addressed was the sailboats the way our moorage is built and our breakwaters are done we cant handle houseboats
7856430 theyre partying and bringing friends that we dont know and causing a lot of problems in the marina
7856431 in the course of making this decision i thought long and hard about what i brought and what i did not bring to the mayors office i took into consideration my family the many people that have supported me those that have encouraged me and those that asked me to continue to represent the citizens of this community
7856432 as i consider the positives regarding a second term as mayor i find 28 000 reasons to continue that being said when i consider my family i find many reasons to return to nursing
7856433 given that the position of councillor would allow me to continue to represent people on the westside apply the knowledge that i have gained over the past year and at the same time allow me to return to a part time position at kgh i feel that this would be the best way to balance the needs of my family and those of the 28 000 people on the westside
7856434 that wasnt my field i soon found out and because i liked cars so much decided this wasnt a bad profession either there were a bunch of us in salmon arm that liked the automobile business and a local businessman in the city saw what i could do without training and made me an offer that i would come to work for him and he would train me in the business i quickly jumped on the chance to see where it would go and whether i would like this as professional and business i wasnt all that sure i wanted to make the move for my future in this direction but decided to stick it out and it was a good career decision my dad was a heavy duty mechanic so i had that for a background the natural aptitude was there
7856435 i graduated from salmon arm high school and went to work in the shop where my dad worked in the parts department shipping and receiving then i decided to go traveling for a year when i was doing that job in the parts department i was most interested in how the place ran as a business when i came back from my year of travel i decided i was going to take the business program at ouc at that point it didnt matter what business it was going to be i just knew i wanted to get involved in something i had a mentor in salmon arm that helped me to get an inside look at the business world before i was finished school the opportunity to take over the auto body shop where todd worked in kelowna became available we worked out the details of what it would take to buy the shop and six months later we started in september 2003
7856436 we took over rudys body shop and in march 2004 and we renamed the business prestige collision we just didnt have enough room at rudys as you know it was a small operation for things like parking so we started to look the following year we had a couple of deals fall through before we found this space on kirschner road we put our offer in and it was accepted in june 2007
7856437 on part of the project we hired a general contractor because of our lack of expertise in this area even in the family there was no construction experience the contractor built the body shop and we tackled the strip commercial centre
7856438 in our first shop we hired a couple of people that were older than us but they didnt fit into our way of thinking about the future stuck in their ways probably describes it best were stubborn and very precise about the way we want things done with the customer front and centre all the time because we started this new shop we wanted harmony from the get go and hiring the young technicians has been the best thing that we could have done and the work they produce is outstanding it is great to have people on staff that actually care if the customer comes back in the future were trying to create a culture that you will feel when you come into the building where people will see the work that is being done by a crew who will care about the finished product it makes for a good place to work everyone on staff is part of what we are trying to accomplish here the last eight months in the old building were super stressful we were so tight on space and it was difficult for everyone but they saw what our plans were for this new location and they wanted to be a part of the expansion and the future we are four times the size now that we were back then our specialty is collision repair thats what we fix we dont really restore cars or do complete paint jobs our specialty would be making your car look as good or better than before it was in an accident
7856439 since the moment i set foot on this site i was inspired to create a place where the full resort get away experience could be enjoyed by owners and vacationers and we are thrilled that bellstar has come on board to help us create and implement such a program
7856440 the fact that bellstar is also providing technical and planning expertise operations management and their reservations system adds greater value to the resort
7856441 but we are trying to understand the label on a juice bar
7856442 it is one of those ideas that makes you wonder why didnt someone think of this before
7856443 i had an episode with summit energy they contacted me the day after my husband died and talked to my son he told them they should talk to me because their offer sounded good they never did and i never signed anything nor did anyone else but they told terasen that i was their customer and it took endless calls and several months of higher bills and an ultimate complaint laid by me with the utilities commission before summit let me out from under what they called compassionate grounds this was without a signed contract my advice is dont even talk to these people
7856444 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac

7856449 midway on the journey of my life i awoke to find myself alone and lost in a dark wood having wandered from between archaeologists absorbed in their speculations on the rites of the second century and modernists who wish to give as the extension of the franchise tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes our ancestors it is the democracy of the dead tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking about all democrats object to men being disqualified by the accident of birth tradition objects to their being disqualified by the accident of death democracy tells us not to neglect a good mans opinion even if he is our groom tradition asks us not to neglect who love her but little and seldom have recourse to her how much more loving will she be to those who love her and often call upon her st alphonsus liguori does not loudly proclaim how we may come by a straight course will decay alas and will become dust it will come to the tomb which is the bane of all flesh but we are all part of christ pray to the lord that forgiveness of sins flows freely yea i shall enter where after lamentation have gone our brothers suited to the roman liturgy therefore other things being equal of the martyrs and tremble not before the successors of julian the apostate we are the sons of the crusaders take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i have set a guard to my mouth when the sinner stood against me i was dumb and was humbled and kept silence from good things and my sorrow was renewed my heart grew hot within me as far as possible i go to mass every day this is a rosary as far as possible i kneel down and tell these beads evey day if you reject me on account of my religion i shall thank god that he has spared me the indignity of being your representative

7856511 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7856512 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying

7856567 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7856568 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7856569 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7856570 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7856571 i think he was just so tired of feeling so bad
7856572 older people are more susceptible to the adverse effects than younger people so drug therapy must be approached carefully
7856573 i think he was just so tired of feeling so bad
7856574 older people are more susceptible to the adverse effects than younger people so drug therapy must be approached carefully
7856575 our medical personnel know from experience that service members are ruled medically nondeployable for reasons such as requisitioning a second pair of eyeglasses bringing dental records up to date and filling dental cavities
7856576 were there some mistakes made yes some soldiers should not have gone and did
7856577 my understanding is the majority of the soldiers not all of them once they got over there and realized they couldnt give them the care they needed they were sent home
7856578 i have a herniated disc in my neck and the army docs said i was fine
7856579 i know they sent us over here hurt so they could keep the numbers up
7856580 well have some units entire units that have served four tours over there
7856581 those are the kinds of things that at least scare me and they should be scaring mental health professionals and the department of veterans affairs and the department of defense
7856582 we do know at least from the research that has been done the more a person is exposed to those traumatic events and for longer periods of time there are real problems but we dont really know
7856583 this is the first time weve really had to deal with that
7856584 equitability is so keen and essential to making sure were taking care of our force
7856585 the increasing need for able warfighters has meant longer and multiple deployments for its soldiers
7856586 in any military plane youre supposed to be wearing your kevlar helmet
7856587 i had it on once for like five minutes and
7856588 i went into her office she said youre good to go she stamped the paperwork
7856589 the chain of command wanted to send me to iraq to get my treatment there they thought i could get enough treatment in theater
7856590 they told me to get ready to go they were getting ready to give my weapon back to me
7856591 we cant be relied upon to do our job were taking up someone elses time watching us to make sure were ok someone has to do that when they could be doing something else
7856592 look this soldiers not going to iraq theres no way
7856593 they need people is what was told to rear detachment send me people
7856594 i had to take out all my plates but two
7856595 no ammunition no water i had other people carrying my gear for me soldiers we help each other out
7856596 my first sergeant gave up his own 9mm pistol so i wouldnt be breaking a profile
7856597 he was released from the hospital into the loving arms of the government who sent him directly back to iraq
7856598 he was put on active duty while he was still on a liquid diet unable to eat solid food because of a throat hemorrhage due to a botched surgery at a military hospital
7856599 basically the only gear he can wear out of his combat gear is his helmet
7856600 after a couple of minutes it feels like a 100 pound weight on his chest he cant breathe
7856601 theyre trying to fill their quotas they dont care about lives they care about bodies
7856602 so when they got moved to the left were there problems getting them yes there were because the system never caught up
7856603 our goal was 95 percent we went through with 87
7856604 as the army starts backfilling everyone else over the last six months we have received over 500 soldiers again its just a goal that commanders have if you dont reach it you dont reach it
7856605 we have been having issues with reaching deployable strength and thus have been taking along some borderline soldiers who we would otherwise have left behind for continued treatment
7856606 theyre sending units so rapidly theyre having trouble getting them healthy
7856607 no initial indication that the units deliberately deployed medically unfit soldiers against explicit medical advice
7856608 the term medical no go is unclear and as witnessed by recent public media interest can easily be misunderstood
7856609 very good competent commanders that i think are doing a tremendous job and they work closely with the medical care providers and ill tell you i dont think there is any evil here these are americas sons and daughters and we dont put people in command who dont take that responsibility quite seriously
7856610 war is hard and there is no doubt you can see the army is working hard to get back to 12 month deployments from 15 months because we know this is tough on our soldiers and families too it is very hard
7856611 with his profile he was not supposed to go he stops breathing
7856612 he has a machine that goes over his face to help him breathe at night if his machine breaks down they have to send it back to the states to fix it he does have a backup but how long is that going to last
7856613 tim has a profile that says hes not supposed to go but his first sergeant and his commander said youre going anyway its numbers thats all it is they dont care who goes out there they dont care whats wrong with them they just need the numbers its really frustrating
7856614 you can create profiles and associate nearly anything in pop culture
7856615 they seem to care for the welfare of those they know

7856620 what it took for him to get here was something i never thought id see in my life

7856622 o morais deixa o time mais baixo por isso preferi deixar o carlos alberto de fora

7856624 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7856625 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7856626 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7856627 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7856628 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7856629 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7856630 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president

7856633 a adir al ya intenso dolor de la tragedia sufrida un menosprecio a los sentimientos de muchos de los ya fallecidos y de sus familiares
7856634 si se perpet a este acto religioso monoconfesional oficial para el conjunto de las v ctimas supondr a no s lo un monopolio religioso sino aplastar la dignidad de muchos ciudadanos en un momento de m ximo sufrimiento personal
7856635 se deber a haber hecho caso a la petici n de otras confesiones y resolver el problema de otra manera para no dar la sensaci n de que hay una religi n oficial en nuestro pa s
7856636 adem s la iglesia cat lica mantiene en su m s alto nivel un di logo ecum nico y plural con otras confesiones por lo que podr a desarrollarse un acto multiconfesional el fondo de la cuesti n es que en un estado laico no deber a haber ceremoniales religiosos de ning n tipo el gobierno no deber a organizar un funeral de estado ni amparar la sensaci n de que hay una religi n oficial
7856637 no tenemos una relaci n tan fluida con la moncloa como la puede tener la iglesia cat lica
7856638 si el funeral de la almudena s lo fuera para los cat licos me parecer a correcto o si las autoridades no asistieran tambi n pero el problema es que est situaci n se repite vez tras vez hasta cuando han muerto militares evang licos se ha oficiado un funeral de estado
7856639 se alega que espa a es mayoritariamente cat lica y que por eso debe ser as pero la igualdad no es algo que se mida por un criterio cuantitativo sino cualitativo tras el 11 s en nueva york se realiz una ceremonia pluriconfesional con representantes de todas las confesiones de las v ctimas y pas lo mismo tras el atentado de casablanca pese a que marruecos sea un pa s musulm n espa a en este sentido va mucho m s retrasada que otros pa ses
7856640 se trata de ir poniendo en marcha el contenido aconfesional de la constituci n
7856641 nosotros queremos certificar el costo de las placas y que no sea un programa electorero que no sea promoci n de partido

7856643 nosotros no estamos en contra s lo queremos m s informaci n lo que nos preocupa es el gasto
7856644 el motivo que nos abstengamos es una serie de dudas nuestro voto depende de las respuestas de gobierno del estado no necesariamente tendremos que estar en contra
7856645 si esas son las grandes pol ticas p blicas que tiene este estado en seguridad pues qu fregados estamos
7856646 es una jalada me est n vendiendo que con eso vamos a mejorar la seguridad del estado yo tengo mis dudas no me parece que sean las mejores medidas que pueda poner este estado en seguridad
7856647 no hay ning n antecedente de que gobiernos panistas hayan utilizado las placas con fines electoreros

7856649 mortality and cardiovascular events in patients treated with homocysteine lowering b vitamins after coronary angiography
7856650 vitamins are meant to be taken for preventative measures to support long term good health rather than treat disease
7856651 this study is a randomized controlled trial rtc which has become the gold standard for establishing the efficacy of drugs unfortunately it is poorly suited to the evaluation of the effects of nutrients this type of study is doomed to fail since nutrients and drugs have two different mechanisms
7856652 eat a healthy diet exercise and take your b vitamins as needed research shows b vitamins support heart health cognitive function and provide many other benefits when taken long term as part of an overall healthy plan

7856673 dissident republicans groups pose a significant threat to both the police and the general public
7856674 the secretary of state has admitted as much in the house of commons and the recent attempt to murder police officers in lisnaskea by way of a rocket propelled grenade shows that these groups are developing their capacity to inflict injury and damage on people and property
7856675 the chief constable has said that the dissident republicans will be pursued to the ends of the earth now lets see it backed up with serious and co ordinated action to take the criminals behind these groups out of circulation and put those involved behind bars were they belong
7856676 we therefore have no problem in supporting a serious and robust campaign against these dissident terrorist groups
7856677 people will be aware that the provisional ira itself started out as a splinter group and because it wasnt strangled at birth in the early 1970s it grew
7856678 tough action is called for now to eliminate these groups the police should be given the resources and the support they need to take the fight to the dissident republicans
7856679 the dup will continue to monitor the situation closely and we will be meeting with the security minister to discuss the threat posed by these groups and the resourcing of policing in the areas where these groups are most active specifically in the west of the province

7856695 we are extremely excited to announce this transaction for our third non core asset atrigel this licensing deal will bring our total proceeds from our announced non core asset transactions to approximately us 240 million

7856697 these data are exciting because they demonstrate that recombinant vlps are a valid and potent vaccine approach against influenza combined with our innovative manufacturing approach our vlp vaccine candidate has the potential to address an unmet need in pandemic influenza preparedness efforts being planned by health authorities around the world
7856698 this data milestone marks good progress in the viability of novavaxs vaccine which combined with ge healthcares ready to use bioprocessing technologies signals the promise of a solution to problems countries face in preparing for the inevitability of pandemic influenza
7856699 in the face of a global health threat innovations are required that can deliver safe and effective vaccines quickly and reliably
7856700 two doses of this novel vaccine which is designed to prevent bird flu gave strong immune responses the data are encouraging that this new vaccine approach can help prevent pandemic influenza

7856703 market drivers for both the innovator and generics sectors of the global pharmaceutical market are converging as both sectors accelerate their search for high quality manufacturing at the lowest possible cost this new agreement is targeted at addressing this convergence coupling proven biocatalysis technology with large scale manufacturing capability we are very pleased to be broadening our collaboration with arch which has become an important strategic partner
7856704 codexis and arch have built a successful partnership over three years based on anticipating customer needs and consistently meeting them in the rapidly growing global market for high quality low cost pharmaceutical intermediates and apis
7856705 we are now well positioned to build on this success serving the growing global demand for cost effective high quality pharmaceuticals
7856706 the rigorous trial design and the fact that all three primary endpoints were met with statistical significance reinforce the quality of the data supporting the potential for azilect to have an effect on disease progression
7856707 the successful outcome of the study provides further rationale for the early use of azilect among parkinsons disease patients
7856708 delaying disease progression is the most important unmet need in the management of parkinsons disease
7856709 the adagio study the first of its kind was prospectively designed to demonstrate if azilect can slow down the progression of parkinsons disease results of the study show that early treatment with once daily rasagiline 1mg tablets provided significant clinical benefits that were not obtained by those patients where initiation of azilect therapy was delayed by nine months

7856739 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7856740 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7856741 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it

7856743 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7856744 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded
7856745 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with seven to eight houses having been destroyed with serious damage to many others
7856746 local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7856747 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7856748 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7856749 repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7856750 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan
7856751 unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7856752 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7856753 he was hyperventilating from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7856754 our engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly
7856755 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7856756 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety take the safety first option
7856757 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7856758 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7856759 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7856760 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7856761 flakes made from fragments struck from a larger stone core
7856762 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7856763 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7856764 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7856765 thus during hard times and resource droughts these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members on the same team

7856773 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7856774 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7856775 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7856776 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7856777 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7856778 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7856779 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7856780 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class

7856783 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7856784 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7856785 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7856786 whether it is demographic or location whatever data sets they carriers want to pass to us enriches our targeting capabilities
7856787 its going to take 24 hours before they can really say definitively that he is going to be ok but there is some bleeding on the brain apparently so they are monitoring to see if that gets any worse or if they have to go in or if it will correct itself or what have you but right now he is resting comfortably in icu

7856810 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7856811 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7856812 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7856813 this case is about thomas wright collecting campaign contributions and not reporting them
7856814 its not anything hidden or secret about it its pretty straightforward
7856815 i think theyre proving things that they dont like but i dont think theyre proving a crime
7856816 youre certainly supposed to fix your campaign reports right but it doesnt mean its obstruction of justice
7856817 there was nothing intentional to do that that it must be a mistake

7856823 what attracts customers to any company is a great customer experience
7856824 a brand needs to stay relevant with consumers and consumer trends technologies and culture in general change all the time
7856825 therefore a brand must respond to these changes pick up these trends and thus stay relevant a great way to show that you are relevant to consumers ever changing lives is to connect with them and engage them in conversations and activities events and sponsorships are a great way of doing so
7856826 another key issue for companies is how to position brand
7856827 many products are undifferentiated these days they have similar features and even in fast moving markets like consumer electronics features are easily copied
7856828 a company searches for the brand identity the brand values brand core brand dna the brand personality or whatever they call it and at the end they usually come up with trivialities
7856829 for example our brand is warm or innovative or intelligent
7856830 they create emotional ads for example smiling faces of people performing some sort of lifestyle activity i dont like to be cynical but all of this is quite silly plus most of it is developed without any customer input
7856831 what really matters is the customer experience what the customer gets when he or she shops interacts with company people attends events visits a website what really matters is the interaction with the brand not what brand managers and ad agencies are trying to put into peoples heads
7856832 segmentation needs to be done based on experiences we need verbal and visual experiential positioning platforms not these long positioning statements and the four ps must include new media and other innovative touchpoints
7856833 most traditional marketing is despite what marketers say usually product focused some of these concepts complement experiential marketing but its all about the mindset always think customer first always think customer experience
7856834 we have created a formidable management team within the news agency who all bring with them impressive knowledge and experience
7856835 their key objective is to continue our progress in the digital arena ensuring that our content and technology solutions are market leading
7856836 under tonys leadership i am confident that the team will meet the challenges of the multimedia landscape and continue to provide innovative services to our widening customer base
7856837 total sales by the big three carriers will amount to 3 5 million iphones within the next two years
7856838 in mgs4 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent because maybe there is a new approach which i should think about im always thinking about it making it interactive but at the same time telling the story part and the drama even more emotionally
7856839 when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the series
7856840 die daten habe ich von einem bekannten der sie mir gesagt hat
7856841 i knew the moment i started reading depth takes a holiday that sandra was a kindred spirit
7856842 both of our books contained the phrase danskin crotch panel
7856843 sandras new book works on several levels including my own
7856844 theres something very satisfying about reading an account of someone who has a lot of initial anxiety about putting her kid in a public school but who ends up becoming an advocate and activist for public education ill be interested to find out from her at the reading now much of the hysteria about getting your child into a good school is genuine concern for the childs education and welfare and how much is status anxiety
7856845 i love the part where sandra puts all her jonathon kozol books into a wicker basket as if getting ready to drown them thats good stuff
7856846 a search for wisdom from old people while they are still on this earth
7856847 id always thought sandra was exaggerating when she said he uses a frosted flakes box as his briefcase

7856854 this is not an easy choice but it is the only way to save the lives of people
7856855 this is in violation of the principle of territorial integrity which is one of the basic principles of international law and this is therefore absolutely unacceptable and i think the whole of the european union will come forward in stating this very clearly
7856856 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7856857 it does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the caucasus
7856858 most people in their 20s and 30s will tell you that books are so 20th century
7856859 there is every reason to think that books will be a thing in the past in the next 10 20 years
7856860 what i find so frustrating is that when these concerns are brought up to publishers they will stare back at you with blank faces
7856861 there is nothing that we can do they will say and that is when they become victims of their own thinking a thinking that is grounded in the past that does not look forward we will see continued growth in e books in the next few years and many publishing heads are putting a lot of apples in this cart they will be sorely disappointed why because a mass market will never materialize

7856875 es macht immer gro en spa mit dem formel 1 auto au erhalb der rennwochenenden zu fahren weil die zuschauer n her an die action herankommen k nnen in brands hatch bin ich zwar seit ein paar jahren nicht mehr gefahren aber ich liebe diese strecke deshalb ist es toll dass mercedes benz diese demo organisiert hat ich glaube das letzte mal dass ein aktuelles formel 1 auto auf der strecke gefahren ist war 1986 als nigel mansell das rennen gewonnen hat es ist also ziemlich cool jetzt daran anzuschlie en
7856876 es war schon toll mit einem formel 3 durch die druids kurve zu fahren ich kann es kaum erwarten wie sich das in einem formel 1 anf hlt auch andere streckenabschnitte wie zum beispiel paddock hill bend sind fantastisch man kann die kurve nicht einsehen und dann rast man bergab richtung kurvenausgang wo es eine enorme kompression gibt
7856877 die dtm ist fantastisch es ist eine tolle serie die rennen sind immer aufregend und die atmosph re dort ist sehr herzlich
7856878 die fans kommen nah an die fahrer heran da sie problemlos ein ticket f r den paddock kaufen k nnen auf und neben der strecke ist immer etwas los es lohnt sich also auf alle f lle dort vorbeizuschauen
7856879 auf und neben der strecke ist immer etwas los es lohnt sich also auf alle f lle dort vorbeizuschauen
7856880 ich bin zum beispiel mit susie stoddart in der formel renault gefahren und wir sind dort ein paar mal zusammen auf dem podium gestanden bei meinem ersten formel 3 sieg 2004 auf dem norisring bin ich knapp vor jamie green ins ziel gekommen und gary paffett ist mein teamkollege bei mclaren mercedes
7856881 ich hatte das gl ck in diesem jahr in silverstone mein heimrennen zu gewinnen die stimmung dabei war etwas ganz besonderes es w re toll wenn so etwas auch in brands hatch gelingen k nnte
7856882 veranstaltungen wie diese sind eine gute gelegenheit um fans zu treffen und autogramme zu geben ich kann zwar nie so viele schreiben wie ich gerne w rde aber ich versuche mein bestes das ist mir sehr wichtig denn die unterst tzung die ich von den fans bekomme ist unglaublich und so etwas darf man nie als selbstverst ndlich ansehen

7856929 in 10 years iraq may be one of the middle easts most stable nations
7856930 america should not ignore world opinion which has been correct to worry about the way the us has compromised on human rights

7856945 kita majlis fatwa kebangsaan merasakan bahawa proses perundangan harus berjalan dan muhabalah boleh mengambil tempat apabila proses perundangan itu sudah diselesaikan
7856946 apa yang berlaku sekarang harus dijadikan pengajaran agar kedua dua pihak dapat dibawa ke pengadilan dan apabila satu pihak merasakan bahawa dirinya tidak terbela atau teraniaya maka muhabalah boleh dilakukan dengan melibatkan kedua dua pihak berkenaan
7856947 undang undang islam adil dan jangan harus khuatir memikirkan perbicaraan melalui perundangan dan muhabalah boleh dilakukan di mahkamah ataupun di luar mahkamah bergantung kepada keputusan yang akan dibuat

7856950 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
7856951 because mgs4 was optimised for the ps3 it is probably not possible
7856952 but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7856953 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if were referring to that if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore probably i will first create the software and then um its a strange word to say but port to other hardware if that technological ability rises in all areas
7856954 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked
7856955 a lot of them just shrug and go ahead with the connection potentially opening themselves up to attack
7856956 with mgs4 the theme and the world and also many of the gimmicks that i put in the game these are really personal for me

7857284 seek god and live do not look to your money do not look to your entertainment i promise that your money will be worth nothing and your entertainment will comfort no one seek the lord and you will live but if you dont you will experience his glory in his wrath and no amount of money will be able to buy your way out of it because of that there are those who choose to be bitter about gods justice there are those who would rather throw his righteousness away because they have sold themselves out to the follies of money and entertainment but he is the one who formed the stars into their shapes who brings the dead of night to the brightness of morning and who causes the same brightness to become the blackest dark of night who floods the land with the oceans he is the lord seek good not evil that you may live

7857335 june 5th 2002 approximately nine forty five a m this is doctor richard vale speaking with subject charlotte jake of whats your current address
7857336 so you told the arresting detectives that you work for a secret crime fighting organization called bad monkeys
7857337 human beings are more closely related to great apes than
7857338 yeah i suppose technically it should be apes instead of monkeys and technically
7857339 it is if you do it to pay someone back but the organization is not about that were just trying to make the world a better place
7857340 not all of them just the ones that cost benefits decides will do a lot more harm than good if they go on breathing
7857341 not usually its not like being a police officer i mean cops they have to deal with all kinds of people and sometimes upholding the law theyve got to come down on folks who really arent all that bad i can see where that would give you a crisis of conscience but the guys we go after in bad monkeys arent the sort you have mixed feelings about
7857342 he was a prick i didnt like him but he wasnt evil
7857343 i cant just tell you that even if i thought youd believe me it wouldnt make sense unless i told you everything else first but thats too long a story
7857344 no i mean its a long story this morning i could maybe give you the prologue to get the through the whole thing would take days
7857345 well you do understand that youre going to be here for a long time
7857346 im a murderer but thats no reason why you should have to waste your time
7857347 i suppose theres part of me that does i mean i didnt have to mention the bad monkeys to the cops
7857348 well if youre willing to talk then im willing to listen
7857349 youre just going to think im crazy for all i know you already do
7857350 why dont we just start and see how it goes
7857351 tell me how you first got involved with the organization how long have you worked for them
7857352 roughly eight months i was recruited last year after the world trade towers went down and my time in the army was beginning to fizzle out but to be honest thats not the beginning the first time i crossed paths with them was back when i was a teenager
7857353 i stumbled into a bad monkey op i think thats how a lot of people get recruited they are in the wrong place at the wrong time they get caught up in an operation and even though they dont really understand whats happening they show enough potential that the organization takes notice then later maybe days maybe a job opening and new blood pays them a visit
7857354 well it all started when i figured out that the janitor at my high school was the angel of death

7857384 im taking this fight completely serious as if its for a championship its these type of fights that guys take lightly and then get beaten i know that this is an opportunity for me to move up in the heavyweight division jenkins and i were sparring partners for tony thompson when he was getting ready for dominick guinn
7857385 i am the top united states heavyweight prospect and i m willing to fight anybody out there but i have no idea what its going to take to get a big fight hopefully itll get done sooner rather than later i respect their decisions not to fight me because this is a business and they dont want to lose out on a money fight losing to estrada before they cash in but they cant keep avoiding me if they really want to be considered top heavyweights just call my promoter jimmy burchfield
7857386 that siege the coast blockade and the overflights by israeli aircraft all bear witness to the fact that despite israels claimed disengagement in 2005 these realities on the ground establish that gaza remains under israeli occupation and as a result israel remains legally responsible for protecting the human rights of its civilian population
7857387 that has been ignored despite overwhelming evidence of deteriorating mental and physical health that has reached crisis proportions
7857388 above all what is being tested is whether the imaginative engagement of dedicated private citizens can influence the struggle of a beleaguered people for basic human rights and whether their courage and commitment can awaken the conscience of humanity to an unfolding tragedy

7857390 as the alliances leadership has ignored the important peacekeeping role of russia in the caucasus and south ossetia we believe it is expedient to suspend all peacekeeping operations between russia and nato for at least six months
7857391 this is not an easy decision but it is the only way to protect peoples lives
7857392 for the time being we can see no necessity and possibility of sending russias chief military representative to brussels

7857419 the blueant v1 works great right out of the box and is the easiest to use headset with more and safer features than any other bluetooth headset on the market
7857420 we were pleased to team with sensory on the v1 to be first to market with a voice controlled bluetooth headset
7857421 we believe the v1 will set the bar for the industry in terms of headset ease of use form and functionality
7857422 when it comes to checking headset status it will not be necessary to interpret confusing beep sequences or leds bluegenie

7857437 they are a living thing and like humans there are some good ones and there are some bad ones some people say their dog would never be aggressive but i think that could be brought out in most of them
7857438 humans like dogs are very social and you need to have certain rules of engagement otherwise there is complete chaos
7857439 people are interpreting morality in that sense when they look at dogs but they could well be very basic fundamental behaviours that animals exhibit
7857440 freedom of expression and action should not be surrendered upon the issuance of a healthcare degree

7857445 mental leisure activities occupational demands that are extremely demanding could help delay the effect of alzheimers disease then socializing with other people
7857446 i will never hesitate to look for where we can become more efficient and where we can make reductions
7857447 but i think we can say 8 million in program cuts if it were only done that way would have a significant impact on our kids
7857448 this virtually gives the board a blank check from all of madisons taxpayers checkbooks
7857449 it may very well allow the school board members to never have to do the heavy lifting of developing a real long term cost saving
7857450 why would they jeopardize the good will that they are already developing with the public
7857451 something different in terms of confidence that theyre doing something different that theyre working to get information and theyre not just taking them for granted
7857452 my sinker was very very good tonight and the guys played great defense
7857453 any time that that things working im definitely going to use it as much as i can just throw that thing down over the plate and let them hit it into the ground
7857454 hes probably one of the most prepared guys ive ever played with the way pelfrey pitches three runs is all he needed
7857455 this even goes as far as sitting down at the same table as al qaida leader osama bin laden
7857456 the minister of finance is being over ly prudent again
7857457 theres not a large probability at all of having a deficit this year
7857458 given the short term inflexibility in herent in expenditures it is likely that the government would run its first bud getary deficit in over a decade
7857459 i dont think there is anything in the numbers that would indicate a deficit would be a good bet
7857460 we knew that online was going to be a very natural extension to that
7857461 by 2010 20 per cent of our revenues should come from online from digital ap plications
7857462 so if theres a great restaurant you like why not once you have found it save that listing to your facebook profile
7857463 who would have thought that 100 years ago that we would have been repur posing our content for that kind of envi ronment
7857464 when we look at advertisers who in vest heavily online they also tend to in vest more in print than the average so they are looking at it as a way of growing leads
7857465 under terms of the arrange ment ypg will now be able to provide its base of about 425 000 advertisers an enhanced adver tising offering which will im prove the ability of small and me dium sized enterprises to fur ther market their businesses on line
7857466 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision

7857469 i believe in local control i come from a city council
7857470 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
7857471 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
7857472 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
7857473 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
7857474 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
7857475 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
7857476 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well
7857477 in order to have affordable housing you shouldnt have to live in tracy if you work in san jose
7857478 you should have a range of housing and transportation options
7857479 govern ment often has and indeed often must pick winners and losers in order to fulfil its responsibilities whether in the selection of weapons systems for example aircraft produc tion through environmental regu lations decisions on trade policy or regulations shaping whole industries as in telecommunications
7857480 the federal government also has a long history of picking winners that is funding winning technologies that range from the telegraph and radio to atom ic energy and the global positioning system to todays internet
7857481 the dollar wants to pull oil lower and the storm wants to pull it higher its a bit of a tug of war right now
7857482 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sus tained rally
7857483 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7857484 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by rus sia as a bargaining tool
7857485 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7857486 he decided to compromise by giving hyatt a chance to fulfill their commitments by managing this serving of alcohol in a secluded restaurant on the 40th floor so he would keep his hotel with the family atmopshere he would like to present to his guests
7857487 that period was basically a family period for vacations and it wouldnt give you the impact on the alcohol ban that much as if you were in the winter season which features business people and international tourists
7857488 we cant for the life of us work out why they do it
7857489 were doing systematic observations now to determine if theres something that may trigger it but so far we havent found anything
7857490 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7857491 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7857492 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7857493 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7857494 egypt is a consistent ally and a firm partner of the u s in the area

7857497 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7857498 it could be that the safety benefits of driving slower are proportionately greater than the fuel economy benefits
7857499 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7857500 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7857501 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
7857502 we have had two separate investors raise their hand as being interested but i dont know whats happened since then

7857508 it appears that sales of agricultural commodities produced and sold by farmers in china such as wheat cotton and corn are exempted from the vat
7857509 when these same products are imported it appears that they are assessed the vat at the rate of 13 per cent

7857525 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
7857526 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7857527 can easily be transposed in this context to argue that any human who oppresses another forges his own chains of nagging

7857532 we have had the privilege of meeting some outstanding men and women recruiting them to taylor watching them flourish and seeing them make an impact in the world
7857533 taylors tradition of global engagement is not a recent phenomenon
7857534 from taylors earliest days our students faculty staff and alumni have served and studied in many different overseas settings
7857535 taylor university is recognized as being a highly selective academic institution where students with vibrant spiritual lives live primarily on campus or in university approved housing
7857536 it is who we are we are pleased given current economic realities that our enrollment continues to be high evidencing a demand for a taylor educational experience
7857537 we are excited to welcome an extraordinary freshman class along with new and distinguished faculty members as we begin this our 163rd year we are all rededicating ourselves to the purposes of god for his kingdom and the work he is doing at taylor university

7857544 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
7857545 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7857546 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7857547 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7857548 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7857549 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
7857550 will work closely with relevant countries to have north korea resume the disablement work as early as possible

7857590 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised
7857591 forcing the feds chairman ben bernanke to resign and abolishing the fed is the most expeditious way to boost the dollar and help the economy recover
7857592 no country in the world has ever succeeded by debasing its currency
7857593 thats what this man bernanke is trying to do hes trying to debase the currency as a way to revive america it has never worked in the long term or the medium term

7857597 iads and dsl routers with built in voip capabilities are a hot topic in the residential market
7857598 sitel is the first to market with a simple and compact cat iq module that can easily be integrated into existing iad solutions to add cordless functionality irrespective of the manufacturers level of rf design experience
7857599 the new triumph wheel has been designed for all applications where the need is great for high capacity and ease of maneuverability
7857600 our customers especially those in the automotive industry and other tow line operations should be very happy with these new models for their demanding and specialized applications
7857601 it only toughens our resolve to do an operation like this
7857602 the result of this operation thus far has been a huge blow to the enemys ability to plant major ieds and more to plant them along highway 1 in southern kandahar
7857603 its thrown them off balance and well continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance in that specific area
7857604 this is our last hurrah this is the battlegroups last push to clear pashmul
7857605 it is literally a massive reflection of how far the canadian army has come over the last few years
7857606 all these individuals have said they wont even attempt to make a claim for compensation because they will be found out by the taliban and they will be killed
7857607 this is a historically significant operation for this rotation and its effects are very important in the context of the campaign at this time
7857608 men are handling the grocery shopping more than ever before either on their own or shared with their spouse
7857609 men are grocery shopping more because they say it gives them time with their spouse partner or family
7857610 in contrast women are more likely to shop independently and say it gives them some time alone
7857611 men tend to buy treats like three different kinds of potato chips while women tend to choose household items such as detergent cleaning supplies and paper items
7857612 shopping enjoyment decreases steadily as consumers age particularly among older women
7857613 when you think about it grocery shopping is not an easy task when you are in your 60s or 70s
7857614 the weight of the shopping bags the convenience or lack of it with parking and the size of some supermarkets can be a chore for older shoppers
7857615 you cant ask questions in a sermon i dont have answers i just have words

7857618 be patient with me and i will pay you back
7857619 the big thing thats been happening this year is la nina which has lowered global temperatures somewhat
7857620 la nina has faded in the last couple of months and now we have neutral conditions in the pacific
7857621 the principal thing is to look at the long term trend
7857622 2008 will still be significantly above the long term average theres been a strong upward trend in the last few decades and thats the thing to focus on
7857623 n o engula o chiclete ele vai ficar preso na sua barriga por sete anos
7857624 ent o cada pessoa que engoliu um chiclete nos ltimos sete anos teria vest gios de goma de mascar no trato digestivo
7857625 s vezes conseguimos ver um peda o da goma de mascar engolida mas geralmente ela n o fica l por mais de uma semana
7857626 nada duraria tanto tempo assim a n o ser que fosse t o grande que n o pudesse sair do est mago e ficasse preso nos intestinos
7857627 provavelmente passa por ele mais lentamente que alimentos de verdade mas as contra es do trato digestivo acabam a empurrando para fora e o chiclete expelido praticamente sem sofrer qualquer dano
7857628 uma pessoa engoliu sementes de girassol mas tamb m as cascas
7857629 todas as sementes estavam presas em volta de um chiclete
7857630 if i overdwell on this it cant be helped love is important and the reasons you get it or fail to are important the number of women in my generation who in retrospect anyone will apply the term great love to in any connection is going to be minute i needed to know if i had a chance here love is strenuous pursuing someone is strenuous what i say is that if you find yourself condemned to wanting love you have to play while you can play of course it would be so much easier to play from the male side they never go after love qua love ever they go after women and for men love is the distillate or description of whatever happened with each woman that was not actually painful in feeling tone there is some contradiction here which i cant expel what was moving me was the feeling being worth someones absolute love great love even and to me this means male love whether i like it or not cest ca here i am there i was i dont know if getting love out of a man is more of a feat of strength now than it used to be or not except i do it is its hideous its an ordeal beyond speech when im depressed i feel like what was meant by one of his favorite quotations a bitter feast was steaming hot and a mouth must be found to eat it men are like armored things mountainous assemblages of armor and leather masonry even which you are told will self dismantle if you touch the right spot and out will flow passionate attention and we know that this sometimes does happen for one of our sisters or has happened this comes full circle back to my attitude towards kissing which he never adjusted to you want kisses obviously but you want kisses from a source a person who is in a state this is why the plague of little moth kisses from men just planting their seniority on you is so intolerable of course even as i was machinating i was well aware i was in the outskirts of the suburbs of the thing you want or suspect is there but at this moment in my life i was at the point where even the briefest experience of unmistakable love would be something i could clutch to myself as proof that my theory of myself was not incorrect theories can be reactionary and still be applicable
7857631 i should not have been placed in that position i was never in such a position never ever
7857632 i have said right from the beginning that had someone come along to make a film of my book i would have been ecstatic because to me the book is a story that has everything that would make a really good film
7857633 i cannot understand why they had to change things to that extent
7857634 the only things that moved in hiroshima were the flies over the dead
7857635 i realized there are two kinds of courage the courage to die and the courage to live i chose the courage to live even if i was alone
7857636 even though we survived we couldnt live or die like human beings
7857637 overtime compensation will begin after ten hours of voluntary overtime have been worked
7857638 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised
7857639 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7857640 and i said to myself something is going on here
7857641 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7857642 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7857643 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7857644 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7857645 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7857646 il faut aller au bout de ton r ve si tu veux gu rir gu rir
7857647 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
7857648 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
7857649 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7857650 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
7857651 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7857652 the fact that the president signed the recognition of the independence of both territories is an irreversible act
7857653 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
7857654 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7857655 it does nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7857656 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
7857657 mohammad i believe was trying to make his way away from the incident and during the course of the incident he has fallen and struck his head on the pavement sustaining serious head injuries
7857658 the questions we need to answer are was he assaulted was he punched or pushed did he fall and try and find the exact circumstances of how it came to be
7857659 clearly much of the investigation will seek to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened to young mohammad
7857660 the young man had spent about five weeks in hastings and was due to return home next weekend his death is incredibly sad
7857661 the problems and issues they are involved in are very few in comparison to these large numbers
7857662 notwithstanding this no matter how rare an incident like this is the effect on the young mans family can only be imagined
7857663 i saw the english boys attack the arab boys in the street
7857664 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7857665 not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually i think they wrestle with these things in profound ways
7857666 the millions of international users who primarily use mobile devices instead of a personal computer to stay connected with friends family and colleagues
7857667 told us the kindle is definitely selling very well but they also said the analysts and reporters giving out these extremely high estimates did not run them by company

7857690 convene a joint committee meeting of civil and syariah lawyers to discuss and recommend measures to formulate clarify and rectify procedures relating to marriage between muslim and non muslim conversion custody of children and burial ritual
7857691 the bar council forum on saturday should have been allowed to proceed
7857692 a small group of us met to discuss the forum and we were unanimous that it should have been allowed to proceed there are valid reasons for such a forum
7857693 as was emphasised to us by international islamic university constitutional law expert dr abdul aziz bari and hanifah maidin the head of pas legal bureau article 121 1a of the federal constitution when passed had not envisaged the circumstances that could arise for example the impact on people of other faiths embracing islam
7857694 among the issues was that of one person converting to islam without the knowledge of the spouse and the conversion to islam of the children by one parent without the knowledge and consent of the other
7857695 the problems are due to the conflict of jurisdiction between the syariah and civil court in relation to divorce child custody and distribution of property
7857696 dap is disappointed that deputy prime minister datuk seri najib razaks irresponsible remarks in condoning extreme hooligan and rowdy behaviour that disrupted a forum held by the bar council and threats of using the internal security act against the bar council is a desperate attempt to revive the waning political fortunes of barisan nasional
7857697 he hoped that the bar council got the message that there are certain things that are out of bounds for public discussion even if held in a private place
7857698 it is regrettable that some members of political parties such as pas pkr and umno were involved in the almost violent demonstration
7857699 what have been stated as matters which should not be discussed we should not discuss
7857700 we will not rule out the possibility of anwar being arrested and it looks like they are planning to charge him by monday
7857701 we are not worried we will face it he is not a threat it is a democratic process good luck to him
7857702 you have people that are feeding habits drug habits alcohol habits people steal for a variety of reasons
7857703 were just concerned about the actual usage of the radios
7857704 there is the possibility of interference in anything we have going on
7857705 anybody with a little bit of knowledge can potentially hurt us in a situation that we really need to be on the right path with everything
7857706 it can be devastating if we had a critical patient and we came back to our ambulance and we couldnt start it
7857707 it is awfully coincidental that its all happened at the same time so theres a possibility that it is
7857708 whats a shame about that is the fire stations for years and years and years have been a welcoming place
7857709 its been a place where people felt free to come in and just sit down and talk to us
7857710 its a shame that now were going to have to really tighten down and re evaluate all our security procedures and probably these doors will be closed
7857711 if you need us now were still here you just need to come in the front door and ring the bell

7857740 we are arguing that the genuine theological task can be carried on successfully only when it begins from within an explicit framework of faith only from this starting point can there be carried on the exegetical task which has as its goal the penetration of the theological dimension of the old testament approaches which start from a neutral ground never can do full justice to the theological substance because there is no way to build a bridge from the neutral descriptive content to the theological reality it is simply a presumption of historicism to assume that tools which function adequately in one area can claim the right of priority in the theological task as well
7857741 the exegete interprets the single text in light of the whole old testament witness and vice versa he understands the whole of the old testament in light of the single text the circle of exegesis moves from the specific to the general and back again and in the process one seeks for increased illumination the exegetical circle is destroyed either if the analysis proceeds only in one direction and arrives at the general by summarizing the specific or the reverse if one moves only from the direction of the general and finds its illustration in the specific
7857742 interpretation in faith the theological responsibility of an old testament commentary

7857906 a souvenir in the corner of doron ovitss office attests to the challenges of farming in israel
7857907 the problem isnt only in israel many arid regions of the globe including the american west are dealing with growing populations and shrinking water supplies global warming could make matters even worse in a speech earlier this year the secretary general of the united nations ban ki moon said the shortage of water could lead to violence our experiences tell us that environmental stress due to lack of water may lead to conflict and would be greater in poor nations he said population growth will make the problem worse so will climate change as the global economy grows so will its thirst many more conflicts lie just over the horizon some economists suggest that arid countries should focus on growing only those crops that give them a competitive advantage like water sipping grapes and vegetables and buy everything else on the world market
7857908 the recent volatility and high prices in commodity markets have made many world leaders reluctant to rely on global markets some oil rich countries like saudi arabia are now shopping for farmland in more fertile countries like sudan and pakistan others are now more determined than ever to increase their own food production israel among them the question now becomes at what cost
7857909 israel has always been considered to be at the forefront of water efficiency in agriculture modern drip irrigation was invented in israel and israeli companies like netafim now ship drip irrigation systems all over the world israel has also aggressively pursued the use of treated sewer water for irrigation mr ovitss tomatoes and peppers for instance are irrigated with recycled sewer water that he says is even cleaner than the drinking water for all the countrys efforts though it cant control the weather
7857910 agriculture in israel now consumes 500 million cubic meters of potable water and an equal amount of other types of water primarily treated sewer water the country plans to provide a further 200 million cubic meters of recycled sewer water and build more desalination plants to supply even more water if the desalination and recycling projects are implemented a lack of water is not expected in 2013 mr simhon said
7857911 is such an investment wise for a sector that contributes just 2 percent to the gross domestic product some critics suggest that israel would be better off focusing on conservation others have predicted a dire future the chief scientist in the environment ministry yeshayahu bar or was quoted in the economist in june as predicting that global warming would cause 35 percent less rainfall contamination of underground water sources and pollution of the sea of galilee this nations largest source of fresh water
7857912 in the golan heights roni kedar 46 hopes his farm can survive long enough for a solution as a farmer for kibbutz ein zivan which abuts the syrian border he has spent the last 30 years trying to conserve water while growing grapes apples flowers and berries his crops are irrigated with treated sewer water and rain runoff that is captured in a nearby reservoir which is now severely depleted he grows plants that do not require much water and feeds them with irrigation lines that drip water directly onto a plants roots minimizing waste and he is now experimenting in his apple orchards with mesh nets that may further prevent evaporation but because of the drought israeli officials have cut the kibbutzs annual quota of water this years cuts were particularly harsh to 1 million cubic meters from 1 8 million forcing mr kedar to tear out some of his orchards and rip the fruit off of some of his apple trees to keep the trees alive but preserve water

7857920 recognition of the utility of stable isotope studies now spans applications as diverse as carbon water cycle environmental studies animal migration tracking and human metabolic pathway research full exploitation of this potential requires easy and fast access to high quality isotope ratio data but has been limited by the high cost and practical constraints of existing mass spectrometry tools we believe the advent of turn key cost effective instruments that require no special training or sample handling is going to completely revolutionize this field and more importantly significantly expand the number of practical applications for stable isotope measurements

7858001 weve done prototyping for a centralized power pack that would be on a vest on the back and weve also been working on decentralized approaches so you would have individual m2e units that would be integrated into various devices like night scopes and night vision goggles and different communication devices
7858002 we are in the process of building a small scale generator that can just show how if you put this in used it in a wind turbine that you would help reduce some of the gearbox problems that they have you would get greater efficiency which would then allow wind power and ocean wave to be more competitive with fossil fuel based power
7858003 noise shrugged his shoulders and said directly into the camera
7858004 the findings of this study are in line with our experience with respect to receivables and charge offs we are seeing continued program opportunities as vendor partners focus on their core manufacturing competencies our customer loyalty remains high as financing continues to represent significant value add to manufacturers end user relationships
7858005 business investment in capital goods continues even in light of the credit crunch and weakness in the overall economy it is a testament to business confidence and export demand
7858006 as we used to say when i was a kid it was bigger than a breadbox and smaller than a dump truck but they were able to get it in they literally put it in a room and showed and explained how literally off the shelf without doing anything illegal they actually constructed this device
7858007 it is unwritten law in chicago politics that nobody wants nobody nobody sent thus it is no surprise that joe biden and barack obama have friends in common in the daley machine
7858008 something tells me the graphics department at obama hq wasnt very excited about having to work late friday night on this announcement
7858009 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7858010 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7858011 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic

7858040 a few years ago i had lunch with the head of a major motion picture studio who declared that his central problem was not finding good people it was finding good ideas since then when giving talks ive asked audiences whether they agree with him almost always theres a 50 50 split which has astounded me because i couldnt disagree more with the studio executive his belief is rooted in a misguided view of creativity that exaggerates the importance of the initial idea in creating an original product and it reflects a profound misunderstanding of how to manage the large risks inherent in producing breakthroughs

7858060 the conquest of sin death and the devil and the establishment of the rule of god do not await some future cataclysmic realization it has in fact already been inaugurated although its presence is quite unobtrusive thus it is that in the period between christs two comings this age and the age to come coexist as a result eschatology or the penetration of gods future into the current time of sin and death is light that floods across a number of new testament doctrines certainly in doctrines of salvation everywhere there is the already not yet tension that the present of eternity in time creates or more accurately that the presence of christs victory that is already present amidst fallen human life creates
7858061 the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field though it is the smallest of all your seeds yet when it grows it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches
7858062 the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount

7858073 the vast majority of faculty view the role that librarians play as just as important as it has been in the past
7858074 tested three roles of the library purchaser archive and gateway
7858075 faculty dont want to have to pay for scholarly resources a finding which holds across disciplines and has remained stable over time
7858076 logical given the increasing prominence of non library discovery tools such as google in the last several years
7858077 despite the rising popularity of tools like google general purpose search engines still slightly trail the opac as a starting point for research
7858078 librarians at all sizes of institutions see this gateway role as among their primary goals along with the licensing of electronic resources and maintaining a catalog of their resources
7858079 faculty members are growing somewhat less aware of the librarys role in providing the tools and services they use in the virtual environment

7858088 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7858089 that was no easy choice to make but it is the sole chance of saving peoples lives
7858090 they are clearly trying to empty southern ossetia from georgians which i dont think goes by any of the books that we deal with in international relations

7858112 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7858113 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7858114 clearly we feel that there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified those agencies
7858115 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
7858116 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
7858117 i dont want to say yes i dont want to say no
7858118 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7858133 the first reaction that most people have when they think of more security is that this will increase cost
7858134 thats true in some cases but on the whole weve found that increased safety makes good business sense too when you get creative and find ways to change the design of your supply chain you can find different routings or different suppliers in a way that reduces the total freight and therefore reduces costs there is some investment but theres a return on the investment too

7858230 there has to be a way of separating genuine cases like mine from deliberate cheating no matter how much i hate someone i wouldnt want to wish what i went through on anyone
7858231 i was relying on my memory and it isnt infallible
7858232 exactly exactly if you dont remember you have to have another safety net
7858233 people think i just waltzed right back in it was not like that at all it was extremely stressful
7858234 they did not give me an easy time at all and they wouldnt want to give me an easy time
7858235 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
7858236 we have the cup competitions that we think we can win this year
7858237 this teams capable of doing that that would be brilliant
7858238 for me personally id love to win something and i know the lads are desperate hopefully ramos can bring the winning habit he had with seville lifting the uefa cup twice
7858239 because of the history of tottenham people always like to talk about the past but its up to us as the players to change that
7858240 if you look at the players we have at the moment were in a false position i think everyone realises that but one thing we have to do is get out of it its as simple as that its up to the players
7858241 but theres no question well get out of it and get back to back wins which were very capable of doing we did it last year and went on a great run its a matter of time
7858242 nobody likes to get beat i certainly dont and nobody likes looking at the table to see where we are
7858243 the way they planned it tonight was supposed to be sort of the personal michelle obama will talk about barack obama personally ted kennedy was a very personal emotional speech
7858244 but i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about barack obama commander in chief tax cuts et cetera et cetera
7858245 you havent heard about iraq or john mccain or george w bush i havent heard any of this we are a country that is in a borderline recession we are an 80 percent wrong track country health care energy i havent heard anything about gas prices
7858246 maybe we are going to look better tuesday wednesday and thursday but right now were playing hide the message
7858247 ive just got to go home and face the music some time my employers arent too happy to have found out ive been playing amateur rugby
7858248 but everythings about money these days and all ive been doing is running around
7858249 i will hopefully be able to train today and tomorrow as well but it is just perhaps too soon for the weekend
7858250 i have been out for five weeks and could do with a reserve game so hopefully i will be able to get those games in and be feeling really good for after that
7858251 after the year ive had it has been great to be back with the lads the training and all the fun you have with that you miss that side of it when youre stuck in the gym on your own so it is nice to be back involved
7858252 im really pleased for him i played with him for the under 21s i really thought he was a great player and loved playing alongside him
7858253 he has had a rough time going out on loan a lot but now he seems a lot more settled at west ham
7858254 now hes been given his chance he has really taken it but its no surprise i know what a good player he is and he is one of the best trainers
7858255 the popularity of other apple products particularly the ipod has drawn more users to the apple platform
7858256 as a result you see this halo effect of people buying apple computers in addition to their ipods quantifying the halo effect is difficult but we certainly believe that effect exists
7858257 if you look at just the u s home market apple had a 10 4 percent share at the end of the first quarter of this year compared to 7 5 percent for the first quarter of 2007 and 5 4 percent for the first quarter of 2006
7858258 do you notice the difference between people buying computers in an apple store and a store that sells windows machines it really is a different experience
7858259 the main thing is the level of the assistance you get in those stores is phenomenal
7858260 the one time i had a problem with my mac the ability to just head over to the store with my machine under my arm and leave after talking to somebody who really knows what theyre talking about thats really neat
7858261 was wonderful i would stay in an all star vacation home again in a heartbeat ive been raving about it since we got back

7858295 a member of your department becomes the lead story on the evening news
7858296 repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition
7858297 there is an agreement between both sides that no foreign soldiers will be in iraq after 2011
7858298 must be based on a specific deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces and that it should not be open
7858299 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7858300 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7858301 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7858302 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be
7858303 the agreement says that the iraqi government will decide if the security situation is good or bad and whether foreign troops remain in iraq not anyone else
7858304 the iraqi government could ask the americans to withdraw before 2011 if we wish
7858305 unless they change it will be difficult to have the agreement approved
7858306 we will not jeopardize the blood of iraqs sons by giving open immunity
7858307 so iraqi officials will resort to using the dates mentioned in the agreement to sell it to the public even though they might be intended to be used in a guidance way
7858308 if you ask the prime minister what happens if the situation on the ground changes before 2011 then he would obviously say that the dates might need to be changed

7858356 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7858357 for people that are on the show its a part of their journey if theyre going to become a huge artist or not theyre there to learn something and no matter what the experience is going to help them
7858358 kara is going to be right in your face if she has to be
7858359 she knows how to be tough some of that comes from her familys history her italian grandparents immigrated to the bronx but she certainly knows how to be tactful too
7858360 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
7858361 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7858362 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7858363 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher

7858367 flight attendants i mean do they really need something else to deal with
7858368 weve been working for a solution to help people be productive on flights whether thats watching a movie or e mailing or doing business
7858369 youre free to surf wherever you want to but theres peer pressure and the presence of flight attendants
7858370 american has a clear code of conduct with passengers if people are viewing pornography being the best example it is something american is empowering flight attendants to deal with
7858371 there is no way we can take on any additional responsibility here
7858372 we see pornography on occasion if theyre in a place where no one can see it well on a plane we have to approach it if its visible and we have before
7858373 thats on rare occasions but now with internet as you increase opportunity well well see it more
7858374 you can well imagine a parent flying with a child seated next to somebody in the extreme case seated next to somebody watching pornography
7858375 theres always going to be someone who probably steps over the line whats interesting is the question is how do we deal with this person
7858376 our flight attendants will listen if there are complaints theyre observant and trained and if they see something inappropriate theres a discreet way to discuss it with the passenger and ask the passenger to put it away and usually thats what happens
7858377 we cant kick someone off an airplane when were flying along so we have to keep things under control which sometimes means confronting uncomfortable situations
7858378 we are safety and security professionals thats our first priority but we have to manage a whole range of other issues not related to safety and security but that in an escalated situation could become a safety and security issue
7858379 if your own comfort has been disrupted then you need to speak to a flight attendant about it
7858380 as much id love to say that anyone can do what they want at any time in small spaces like that you cant go anywhere
7858381 theres no exit like on a train you can get off you can change cars on a plane the next stop is 3600 feet below you
7858382 just as most people have come to set boundaries for cell phone use in public settings we will see them develop social norms for using the internet in flight

7858386 i think whatever price theyre at i think its the games that have really really driven it
7858387 we started off at the beginning of the year with
7858388 were on rails and i think that those games are going to drive it

7858407 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
7858408 today barak obama is less known than he will be in 9 weeks
7858409 still dont know him well if every american jew had a possibility to talk to barak obama they would agree with him on most of the issues

7858411 why not play some golf with lobbyists while were all here

7858474 i only know the news that is in the press but really osasuna is not interested in a sale
7858475 it was good last night we played really well a vast improvement from the other weekend at chelsea
7858476 i understand an offer has been made but neither club has as yet confirmed that or spoken with me
7858477 a number of premier league clubs have asked about ali and there is no shortage of interest so news of a bid is not at all surprising
7858478 it is now up to bolton but we would hope that they would allow ali the chance to move on
7858479 hes a fantastic footballer with great abilities and weve not seen the best of him yet im sure
7858480 anthony would benefit from going out and getting 20 games hes good enough to go and play in the championship
7858481 if we get international clearance in time janos will possibly play and i think well also look at tullberg
7858482 nade has also done extremely well and this may be a good game to give him a start

7858486 while the existing investments in the pipelines were being adhered to may be newer projects which were at concept stage which were at the backburner may not come to the front burner
7858487 if inflation is an issue till we see inflation easing then it would be unrealistic to expect any easing of monetary policy
7858488 should look at it very positively that an 8 9 per cent growth is here to stay and this is backed by numbers
7858489 now this should augur very well if all these projects come to the front burner

7858515 essentially we combined two critical messages into one simultaneous priority
7858516 the educational agenda was designed to help corporations and suppliers maximize cost savings and growth opportunities in the current economic environment while raising awareness of the worlds eco structure and social environment and the industrys responsibility to both
7858517 mainstreaming csr in business travel management the strategic role of the corporate travel industry
7858518 the time has come to set up an industry standard by which we can measure each vendors carbon footprint to enable corporate buyers to make informed purchase decisions
7858519 the process begins by gathering data on your institutions carbon footprint analyzing it to form the basis of a carbon management program which would include a travel emissions management strategy which then becomes the basis for benchmarking future emissions gains or reductions
7858520 trafficking in persons is an issue of public and private concern and private sector companies including those in the corporate travel industry have a key role to play in addressing this challenge the international organization for migration recommends that companies develop a corporate strategy for an anti trafficking policy that permeates all of their activities ensure that their personnel comply with the policy and encourage their business partners including suppliers to do likewise
7858521 specific preventive actions would include raising public awareness and instituting training programmes for personnel to improve identification of and responses to trafficking situations
7858522 specific actions to protect victims may include the provision of skills training employment opportunities and or the allocation of material resources to support their sustainable rehabilitation and reintegration

7858527 in picking 25 years old born in 1983 we hope to capture some of that original spirit that isaacs had when we first got started with a 40 seat restaurant in downtown lancaster
7858528 i work right here in downtown lancaster at godfrey advertising and i saw the promotion and thought i would take advantage of it
7858529 mother as laughter filled the air you taught me to play and always to be fair she read
7858530 then came the day god called your name now in heaven you stay burning your eternal flame
7858531 having such distinguished writers involved with this project both sets a wonderful inspiration for indigenous children and also sends a really strong message about how important our efforts are she said
7858532 and it is wonderful to see an industry that is all about reading and is all about books reach out to indigenous communities and say we think it is just as important that you have access to appropriate and interesting well written reading material as everybody else
7858533 i love to read it gives me enormous joy to hear of these youngsters learning to write and of course being able to read themselves she said
7858534 im often reading the paper and throwing my arms up in horror thinking what can you do mr griffiths said
7858535 and empowering them with literacy is one of the most powerful things because large parts of the communities cant read or write and therefore they cant self govern or organise themselves in a powerful way
7858536 so this is the beginning of hopefully a whole new generation
7858537 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in dprk as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7858538 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities

7858544 the focus on military measures is distracting the government from the crucial initiatives that are needed elsewhere
7858545 it is true that governments in different countries when in elections tend to push the arctic sovereignty button
7858546 so its essential that minister of public safety stockwell day persuade his u s counterpart the secretary of homeland security to shut down the illegal operations on the u s side of akwesasne
7858547 these are not licensed as required by u s federal law and theyre the prime source of cigarettes that are smuggled into canada and if the reverse was occurring and there was widespread contraband in the u s originating from canada the u s government would insist that the canadian government take action
7858548 were very concerned that the decline in smoking rates has now stopped
7858549 and the reason for that in our view is the widespread contraband problem that is providing access to inexpensive cigarettes and that is impeding governments from increasing tobacco taxes

7858563 the consumer climate was depressed further by the very subdued economic outlook even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7858564 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7858565 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7858566 the german consumer is clearly no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7858567 high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of consumers with manufacturing and wholesale prices rocketing most recently there is little hope of an easing in the price trend of other fast moving consumer goods
7858568 real disposable income for consumption will therefore hardly see an increase this year

7858588 you probably noticed in the press the fact that the anti evolution bill was indefinitely postponed in the house of representatives the other day without objection i understand that there was some sentiment on the committee favorable to the bill but there was so much sentiment against it not only among the members of the committee on education to which it was referred but was among the members of the legislature generally that the proponents did not make an effort to put it across

7858591 we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves ndsh to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be and isnt that the great american story
7858592 its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7858593 it is because of their will and determination that this week we celebrate two anniversaries the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when dr king lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation

7858599 there was a lot of message discipline going on tonight even teddy kennedy and nancy pelosi were speaking to the themes of the convention but michelle obamas voice her personality came through loud and clear it was so impressive

7858601 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7858602 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7858603 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7858604 thus during hard times and resource droughts these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members on the same team

7858682 new evaluation techniques that monitor user experiences while working with computers are increasingly necessary

7858691 we have wanted to take advantage of this technology for several years because it seems a sensible solution to the problems we are facing in this area

7858694 degrading offenders in this way will do nothing for their rehabilitation and nothing for our safety as some will inevitably find a way round this new technology

7858780 i think that armando is different than the other two guys
7858781 you could take armando on one side and you could take robert and james on the other side if i were playing a game today you could pick one out of the hat today id pick armando yesterday i might have picked robert i know one thing all three of them are going to play and they all know it one of the reasons its helped from being divisive is the fact that they all know because weve interchanged them so much but still let them get into a flow in practice they could see how this could work
7858782 it will help the play action pass it will get guys open in the intermediate routes and it will help the pass protection because people are going to have to worry about stopping the run first
7858783 will would be the swing guy where he could go either way he could be a move tight end or a stationary tight end so hes the one that gives us position flexibility

7858798 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have every right to gain independence
7858799 and one of the main legal principles for recognizing independence is the fundamental principle of international law the right of people to self determination
7858800 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia
7858801 the precedent they most like to cite is kosovo although international law is not based on precedents
7858802 there are many examples in history of both successful resolutions of secession crisis when an internal solution was found within the state and situations when this didnt work out there exists no strict regulation in international law
7858803 political factors recognition and the reaction of countries that dont accept this recognition play a determining role
7858804 neither abkhazia and i will allow myself to speak for south ossetia too nor south ossetia will ever agree to live in one state with georgia and we ask you to cross this barrier which has been so hard to cross for many years and to recognize our republics as independent states

7858816 going to the asthma room was the beginning of a nightmare for giselle salandy and several other patients who found themselves in the same situation since 11 last night sunday she sitting in a chair and cant get a bed it affected me too because i am pregnant and because of the long hours on my feet i started feeling sick too

7858819 they could have sent her to a nursing home or something the asthma room crowded there is no space and the place is just claustrophobic so many patients packed into the room and suffering

7859107 from now on we live in a world where man has walked on the moon and its not a miracle we just decided to go
7859108 real beauty is not what you see on the outside but it is whats inside that counts
7859109 the technology available today is light years ahead of what was generally available just five years ago
7859110 add those advancements to increasing technical expertise as we learn more about graphically creating immersive worlds and the conditions are right to have graphics play a major role in telling the story of a game
7859111 cevat yerli and crytek are not only major names in germany but also the global video game market
7859112 130 000 may not seem impressive compared to package titles that sell in the millions but compared to other digital titles that is a friggin juggernaut
7859113 and while its great to have my first title be not only a critically acclaimed one but also a financial success there is a bigger picture at play here that we need to look at
7859114 we are tired of meta emulated crap we want the titles of yesteryear to be paid the proper respect we want them done right and if the price is right well buy
7859115 basically we have set a standard in digital gaming the bar has been raised and you have let developers around the world know that if they invest the time money and heart into making and remaking some great games you will support that initiative

7859124 creator grandfather we ask your blessings on this drum and all these people as they pray for the sacred earth mother that the grandmother might be healed
7859125 the mystical experience of life is that it is unified with every person affecting every other person every action rebounding in every other action every thought echoing in every persons thinking and every heart feeling all that every heart feels
7859126 healing with the heart is not trying to heal but allowing the hearts natural healing energy and cell memories of healing that have occurred to resonate within you and being still and thoughtless enough to allow ones own heart to fall into a shared coherence with other hearts in a form of compassionate prayer beyond words
7859127 now i truly believe that we in this generation must come to terms with nature and i think were challenged as mankind has never been challenged before to prove our maturity and our mastery not of nature but of ourselves

7859141 they are bringing in stupid events volleyball on sand beach volleyball and swimming upside down synchronised swimming is ridiculous its not sport and its not something to be proud of

7859149 its been blown out of all proportion in 1948 organisers did it all in their spare time i remember a bank manager who did it in the evenings they did a great job in terrible circumstances just after wwii
7859150 london should go back to basics the simplicity of the games they should make it more idealistic and not just nation against nation they should try to put over the olympic ideal

7859248 the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
7859249 it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society
7859250 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7859251 thats a big side of me that a lot of people dont know
7859252 they didnt get to see that on idol you know i have four older brothers i was never trying to even care about what i was wearing i was just trying to survive at the household

7859255 each one of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7859256 i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend
7859257 i think shes really connecting to a lot of people who dont necessarily know her as well
7859258 the more people get to know them the better they like them so i think this is really effective
7859259 to witness history history thats what im here to see that we havent seen before history
7859260 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7859261 i think that the fact that shes talking about the 18 million breaking the glass ceiling shes just acknowledging that clinton supporters have really made a difference and that theyre already really behind us all the way
7859262 i think it was really great how she emphasized her own background how she really tried to reach out to the americans in the audience instead of just kind of repeating her husbands point or instead of attacking the mccain campaign
7859263 she just built up her own story and let people connect with it because she knows they will and its really impressive how she chose to do that when she had some different alternatives
7859264 i think weve seen in the last few seasons we can beat anybody so you have to be positive you have to believe that you can do it again at least make it to the final

7859266 i think maybe because it was the one that we played better and the one we showed more desire we were all devastated after that final but i must say after that game we realised that arsenal was a big club and we could compete against anyone

7859291 while the lebanese authorities cannot guarantee these women happiness they should guarantee them the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and family and to earn a living wage
7859292 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognised borders of georgia and are going to remain so
7859293 as to the russian apparent intention to recognise two parts i think it is regrettable
7859294 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party
7859295 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honour the commitments that the russians have signed onto
7859296 the ceasefire also talked about the importance of moving forward to an international way to deal with these sorts of conflicts so to preempt those international discussions is extremely unfortunate
7859297 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
7859298 sometimes i wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it
7859299 he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how
7859300 these abnormal features of tumor vessels impair delivery of circulating chemotherapeutic drugs to the actual tumor site
7859301 because high cell density increases contractility across the entire cell layer these findings suggested that tumor capillary cells are inherently hyper contractile
7859302 previous studies have shown that life experience can affect facial features it also doesnt address what it was about the faces that led subjects to their conclusions he says an ongoing study is looking at that
7859303 being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast

7859305 the impact of the deterioration in the u s housing market has affected our results and while uncertainty exists we are confident in the earnings capacity of the core franchise
7859306 unusually elevated relative to the prior quarter due to the inclusion of 247 million for two corporate accounts related to the u s housing market that were identified as impaired in the first half of the current year
7859307 the size of the provisions for these two exposures reflects the weakness in the u s residential real estate market and the specific nature of the underlying loans
7859308 financial markets remain unsettled with continuing apprehension with respect to capital markets and concerns about an economic downturn
7859309 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners

7859312 ive lived in tennessee for 18 years and in half a dozen other states before that and ive never seen anything like this
7859313 what has been going on lends new meaning to the term police state and its unsettling and frightening
7859314 its kind of like debating what the meaning of the word is is thats what this is equal to
7859315 we expected they would twist the meaning of the metro charter and concoct some sort of opinion that supports the mayors opinion on this
7859316 what they are trying to do is create a stalling tactic to keep the people from voting on this measure we will do whatever it takes if it takes a day in court to get this measure on the ballot and make sure that the peoples voice gets to be heard
7859317 the fate of the english only initiative is in the hands of the davidson county election commission and its lawyers
7859318 i dont know that its an issue we necessarily need to address once we have certified the signatures we send it on to the clerk
7859319 on oct 7 the presidential debates will be held at belmont the eyes of the entire world will be on nashville
7859320 im hoping we can keep this english only referendum off the ballot so this wont obscure all the great beautiful things about nashville tennessee

7859331 senator mccain has talked for years about the dangers of russian policies in the way they conduct themselves and undermine the sovereignty of their neighbours
7859332 first time in my adult life that i am proud of my country
7859333 its healthy its important that people who have worked really hard during a campaign are able to express themselves at the convention on behalf of the candidate they worked for they have to respect the results if they dont want to participate they dont but we hope they will because we need to make the change we need to make for our country and i think they know what is at stake losing is hard and people need to recognize the outcome and decide what the choices are
7859334 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7859335 i think those polls also show among women sen obama is 20 points ahead thats a big gender gap
7859336 some of the people on the fence on this issue are catholics and i think joe biden will help take the message to the catholic community i know that he will be able to do that some are older in that undecided group and well have to show that the difference between democrats and republicans on issues that relate to older americans
7859337 democrats are coming together democrats know what is at stake in this election democrats want to take the country in a new direction and we are organized and unified to do just that
7859338 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim this is about you go out there and you fight
7859339 i think that what hillary clinton did was tremendous for the country she has kicked open many doors which now we have to bring many more women through millions more women through my being speaker of the house was breaking the marble ceiling in congress which is hard sen clinton had a bigger challenge to run for president of the united states what we have to do now is say we have to translate that not just for individuals but for all women
7859340 i most certainly think that calling roll over the states is an important piece of tradition its part of our culture as you say sometimes people say it might not look as clean and neat as some people would like but so what its the democratic way we will come out unified and organized the person that deserves all the credit is sen clinton because her statements have been absolutely great shes a pro she knows whats important for our country her leadership will be something very commendable coming out of this convention
7859341 president clinton knows probably better than anybody whats at stake in this country and what a difference it would make this is barack obamas convention he selected joe biden as the nominee
7859342 we have to recognize the significant contribution that was made by sen clinton and following her lead we have to move forward and select barack obama as the nominee
7859343 what i say to these young women is your work in politics is an extension of your responsibilities as a mom to make the world a better place so many things that all children need better policies so that they can thrive so whos taking care of the children im taking care of the children
7859344 there are real differences here this isnt about who and what its about what the policy is and what it means to the lives of the american people
7859345 we have a lot at stake in this election the harm that the bush administration has done to our country whether its the war without end in iraq what its done to the economy the growth of the deficit what its done to the credit and mortgage crisis the energy crisis you name it there isnt anything thats been improved in this administration we must turn this around and take the country in a new direction ill leave it to the academics and later ill see what happened and analyze it but right now were in a fight
7859346 barack obama is ahead in the states by and large that he needs to be ahead in these polls are polls of what are called likely voters likely voters are people who have voted in the last two elections
7859347 millions more people attracted by hillary clinton and barack obama and some of the other people to the political process who know we need change in our country they will be voting and many people who havent voted in a while will be voting again who voted in the last election is one measure as long as barack obama is even or ahead in that number im confidant in what the new voters will add to his count
7859348 people said to me how did you go from housewife to house speaker from the kitchen to the congress rather than respond to it over and over again i wrote it down in the book know your power i also wrote it as a message to americas daughters so they would feel comfortable and have the confidence to come forward and to be part of the political and governmental affairs of our country as ive said nothing is more wholesome that increased participation by women in the political process

7859391 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
7859392 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
7859393 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
7859394 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago
7859395 we have developed a method that enables us to visualise fingerprints even after the print itself has been removed
7859396 for the first time we can get prints from people who handled a cartridge before it was fired wiping it down washing it in hot soapy water makes no difference and the heat of the shot helps the process we use
7859397 the procedure works by applying an electric charge to a metal say a gun or bullet which has been coated in a fine conducting powder similar to that used in photocopiers
7859398 even if the fingerprint has been washed off it leaves a slight corrosion on the metal and this attracts the powder when the charge is applied so showing up a residual fingerprint
7859399 the technique works on everything from bullet casings to machine guns even if heat vaporises normal clues police will be able to prove who handled a particular gun

7859408 while it is an interesting choice senator obama didnt get it right
7859409 i dont see how picking a vp candidate who has been in the senate 14 years longer than john mccain strengthens the obama campaigns message of change
7859410 senator biden does shore up the ticket as far as foreign policy experience is concerned but given the vast difference in experience it actually makes senator obama look smaller in comparison
7859411 in the democratic primary debates and the recent saddleback forum senator obama has shown that when he is off the teleprompter he is not a particularly good speaker people who are following the campaign recognize why senator obama has refused to appear in town hall settings with john mccain
7859412 toxicology examination detected the presence of methamphetamine doxylamine and trace ketamine in his blood
7859413 no alcohol other common drugs of abuse including gamma hydroxybutyric acid ghb and phencyclidine pcp or common basic or acid neutral medications were detected

7859415 the police officer who executed steven hirschfield shot him from behind
7859416 it is our belief based on a witness account and information learned through the autopsy performed by the san diego county coroner that mr hirschfield was not the aggressor and was not involved in a brawl with police officers prior to being executed by this police officer
7859417 it is our heartfelt belief that the manner in which this police officer handled this situation is consistent with somebody who might hold some preconceived notions against gay people
7859418 approximately 10 minutes into the cruise mr hirschfield jumped overboard
7859419 staff of the cruise ship attempted to rescue him but he refused assistance san diego harbour patrol was called where he continued to resist getting onboard ship
7859420 a struggle ensued between the san diego harbour patrol officer and the decedent and at some point the officer told his partner that the decedent had grabbed his gun
7859421 he was then shot by the on duty harbour patrol officer he was pronounced dead at the scene via radio contact with a local hospital
7859422 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations

7859425 theres a lot of mis education about slavery and it hasnt really been taught in schools at all
7859426 its quite interesting in terms of todays history and what students need to know about the past to understand the present
7859427 you cant really talk about the history of the british empire without discussing this part of history
7859428 by any more reasonable assessment of profits and direct costs the nineteenth century costs of suppression were certainly bigger than the eighteenth century benefits
7859429 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
7859430 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
7859431 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
7859432 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
7859433 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
7859434 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
7859435 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
7859436 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
7859437 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
7859438 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
7859439 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
7859440 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
7859441 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
7859442 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
7859443 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
7859444 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
7859445 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
7859446 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
7859447 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
7859448 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
7859449 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
7859450 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
7859451 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
7859452 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
7859453 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
7859454 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
7859455 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
7859456 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
7859457 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
7859458 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
7859459 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
7859460 my advice to businesses is that if you are there or want to be you have to plan on expropriation so you must structure a deal so that you have very little to lose and if expropriation doesnt happen youre happy you cannot gamble because its clear they the kremlin and their business friends will change the deal on you the minute it interests them
7859461 the problem is that canadians in energy mining or automotive sectors which are considered strategic by the kremlin must be aware of the fact igor sechin one of the top three or four people in russia has ordered that multinationals be subject to very strict tax enforcement
7859462 bp invests in russia then step two because bp knows theres no rule of law in russia lobbies the british government to go easy on russia which is how bp thinks it can increase its political leverage in the kremlin then bp invests more in russia and instead of lobbying russia to improve governance it lobbies its own government at home to be soft on russia
7859463 bp is the pillar of complicity investing us 1 billion in the stolen assets of russias rosneft and now look at what it has gotten then in russia

7859503 if you just focus on a few simple fundamentals and buy with a margin of safety then you go a long way to minimize true investment risk
7859504 since you have indicated that you talked to some real estate agents in the eventuality of putting your house on the market i wonder whether or not the seller has to disclose the possibility of the presence of a windmill farm nearby in the near future if so it would already have an impact on the saleability of the house what would be the percentage of the decrease and have the real estate agents noticed an increase of people wanting to leave the area

7859514 ultimately however the society needs these men for more than defense they need them for reproducation
7859515 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7859516 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7859517 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7859530 we had a school trip round our factory recently at the end the teacher turned to her students and warned them if you dont study hard this is the sort of place youll end up that is the problem manufacturing faces
7859531 over the next four years well be creating two million new jobs that need science technology engineering or maths
7859532 were calling on the government to invest a modest 120m in specific careers advice to show young people exactly how promising a career in engineering can be if we dont do something britain will lose these jobs to foreign competitors
7859533 thats fine but we need technicians and engineers to work in these factories or nothing will get made

7859535 all the iits want formal exemption from implementing quota in appointment of faculty like in the space and atomic energy departments
7859536 since the last 46 years both the above departments have been exempted from quota in the appointment of scientists and we were in the same bracket too till recently
7859537 but since it has been pointed out that the iits are not immune to faculty reservation i personally conveyed to the prime minister today about the problem
7859538 we want the government to formally announce exemption to us for better educational quality at the iits
7859539 the sanctity of the iits needs to be preserved to ensure quality education
7859540 there is no discrimination or groupism within the iits we need to preserve this character
7859541 he assured that he would take up the case in the cabinet and the iit standing committee would also take note of it

7859550 it is being beaten at the moment through hard work and joined up working but it will become more challenging as the numbers of people working on site increases
7859551 sadly it seems to me that the reality does not match the talk it does not match what people have been promised the number of jobs that will be created or the billions of pounds of public money that have been invested in the olympics
7859552 the current figures are dismal despite the billions of pounds being poured into the construction of the olympic park the numerous training programmes and the huge amount of labour that needs doing the number of people from the east end who have received jobs there remains low
7859553 the olympics project should be raising the stakes it will have no sustainability if local people see 85 to 90 of jobs going to outsiders
7859554 the oda has claimed that there are many local people being employed anecdotal evidence from our local officials suggests otherwise
7859555 sub contractors agencies and gangmasters supplying labour to the site use existing networks or where they can procure workers most cheaply
7859556 looking for any signs of slippage and taking steps where necessary
7859557 when it comes to the crunch these are businesses mainly concerned with their bottom line not regenerating east london sustainable regeneration is not really built into the contracts its not a core requirement
7859558 there are targets for getting local people into jobs but its not clear what will happen if the targets are not hit
7859559 are those being taken seriously i dont think so at the moment and if being held to account then that could be a problem

7859563 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7859564 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7859565 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
7859566 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
7859567 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
7859568 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
7859569 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
7859570 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
7859571 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminum copper and iron scrap
7859572 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
7859573 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible
7859574 where that really becomes noticeable is when things soften for everyone

7859628 sometimes it may be the case that we want to have research in this area but dont dictate what research is conducted
7859629 we recognize that we dont have a monopoly on all the good ideas in the department were looking to capitalize on all the research that has potential value
7859630 in some cases it will depend on who is deploying it and in what environment its in
7859631 if its a large enterprise even if they drop a few percentage points of those flows youre probably getting enough information to be able to recognize different events
7859632 the android platform is part of googles strategy to eventually move against microsoft in the enterprise
7859633 google is coming in with the phone because its not a platform that microsoft currently controls and no vendor has reached a monopoly in the mobile space yet
7859634 just like microsoft rode the change from the mainframe to the pc into the enterprise google will look to do the same with the smartphone
7859635 google really needs to focus on the consumer first and we have said publicly that we do not believe android will be an enterprise candidate
7859636 if one of the developers or operators wanted to create an open source profile thats attractive to the enterprise however google would say go for it
7859637 with the economic times being hard its difficult to believe that enterprises will be jumping in and buying everybody new phones
7859638 so the path that apple and google are on for the most part is a good one go after the consumer market first and then alter the capability of the phone so it can address enterprise needs
7859639 developers are always looking at where they can make a buck and i know there are enterprise level developers that want to look at this environment
7859640 ive talked to some developers who have said they are looking at android because they expect it to be a major player
7859641 those guys want access to everything and they dont want google to be overly controlling

7859663 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7859664 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7859665 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7859666 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7859667 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7859668 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
7859669 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
7859670 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
7859671 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7859672 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7859673 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7859674 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7859675 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
7859676 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet

7859719 but these games have had the most positive response of any major event during my time in bbc sport
7859720 the bbc comes in for a fair amount of criticism sometimes justified and often not so it is all the more important that the trust underlines special achievements like this
7859721 these games were unusual precisely because they had so much achievement by team gb so if you compare our one solitary gold medal in atlanta with the fantastic 19 in beijing then inevitably more of our airtime is going to be taken up by uk competitors

7859731 if its out there and you can get it you know go ahead
7859732 im certainly not going to get into lars ulrich mode about this
7859733 if people are willing to have faceless cds in their collection good for them it would be absolutely ludicrous for a rock star to demand that people pay money for albums because the kids havent got that much money so if they can find it for free go ahead but dont do it on oasis records though because thats against the law pinch as many kaiser chiefs as you like and the pigeon detectives but dont nick any oasis im down to my last 4 million and i need to keep the evian water topped up in my swimming pool

7859750 these are not licensed as required by u s federal law and theyre the prime source of cigarettes that are smuggled into canada and if the reverse was occurring and there was widespread contraband in the u s originating from canada the u s government would insist that the canadian government take action

7859768 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7859769 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7859770 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7859771 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7859772 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways

7859775 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7859776 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7859777 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7859778 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7859779 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that

7859783 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7859784 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests

7859816 you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like somebody had opened a door in the back of the aircraft the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering i think people were properly terrified mr hadow whose son was one of those taken to hospital after the incident said a number of oxygen masks inside the cabin had failed to inflate mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he said he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either passengers and crew disembark from the stricken ryanair flight after it lands at limoges from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do however a spokeswoman for ryanair denied claims that the oxygen system had failed he said our engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly the pilot diverted the aircraft and made an emergency landing at limoges international airport in france as a safety precaution terrified passengers told how they had feared for their lives as the aircraft plummeted and a cold wind tore through the cabin of the 168 passengers and seven crew 26 were hospitalised with minor eardrum problems emergency workers said pen hadow with his family at heathrow airport in 2003 on a previous trip the explorer was on the ryanair flight which had to make an emergency landing you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold more bbc apologises after football reporter makes jibe about spanish air crash during match commentary the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask onto my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers

7859840 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7859841 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7859842 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7859843 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7859844 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right

7859855 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful

7859863 the results of this first study on the topic suggest that same sex partners who legalized their relationships in vermont may have been more committed to each other or functioning better prior to obtaining a civil union or that civil union status itself is helping to preserve their relationships
7859864 in contrast to old myths about same sex couples being deficient or less viable than male female couples this research project shows that same sex partners who seek to legalize their relationships actually may be among the best functioning couples in this society
7859865 three year follow up of same sex couples who had civil unions in vermont same sex couples not in civil unions and heterosexual married siblings
