1150000 ive played in running back by committee roles before whoever gets hot thats who its going to be
1150001 i dare to say that vivienne is proving to resemble angelina in spirit attitude and physicality she is quite elegant like her mother and knox hes a bit of me he likes music like his dad
1150002 but when he was born he looked like vladimir putin
1150003 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time shiloh calls the twins her babies she and zahara pick out their clothes help change and hold them its sweet they are like little mommies
1150004 brad and the kids came a few nights each week and spent the night
1150005 as it stands now john will be on the red carpet with her and dont be at all surprised to see jennifer sporting an engagement ring by then these two are serious
1150006 jennifer continues to be more public in her relationship with john than she has with anybody ever
1150007 this was going to be a work week and it turned out to be nothing at all lying around in bed
1150008 ive got some work to do the next couple of days
1150009 my swings all over the place i cant quite find it at the moment and butch and i havent given ourselves the time this week to work on it
1150010 you waste a whole day out on the course and really dont learn anything i get frustrated because its so slow i learned more playing in four hours on tuesday than i will any other round
1150011 a lot of the time i feel ive played three good rounds of golf before the tournament started
1150012 ive gone from such a big high winning the wales open to such a big low some days not wanting to get out of bed and play golf
1150013 ive had a bit of trouble trying to come to terms with everything im going home next week to catch up with the family again and deal with it a bit more
1150014 it was like hanging out with your headmaster for a day at the age of 40 it was brutal i knew everything by time i got on the plane but i have no idea what it was now just like all my other school work

1150017 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
1150018 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
1150019 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
1150020 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field
1150021 tear off a strip from your shirt and bandage it
1150022 cant you like do a spell and heal it up a little for me
1150023 like i did for lady peace i dont think either of us wants me to try that

1150032 you know there are al sorts of portals gateways etc
1150033 someone called one of them and put legs on it and somethings coming through lots of somethings at the same time the way it looks right alice
1150034 if jenn were here she could work up a binding maybe even close it off
1150035 i may need to go back to the shop i didnt bring the worke of boundary
1150036 i only brought the things id been using to work on healing spells
1150037 its not like looking for its kids or its mate or anything
1150038 that that may be something actually that may even be brilliant
1150039 its mate well its not like its intelligent or even a singular entity with a consciousness even but if we make another portal of the opposite polarity we might be able to suck this one through or at least maybe get them to cancel each other out
1150040 ijust i just did something a little bit like this
1150041 is this going to get us rained upon by those bony little monkey demons again
1150042 i can just reverse it send the energy out instead of in if i can do it in the right spot i might be able to fuse the two portals together maybe
1150043 thats what i was afraid you were going to say
1150044 shed be more proud if i could actually find her
1150045 id say youre welcome because id love the credit but i was really just trying to channel everything id seen in all of those japanese monster movies you know its babies mate mortal enemy nuclear power plant
1150046 he was probably there at whatever happened you have a spell or something that will let us communicate with

1150064 the hope of photography is not to capture something as we might apprehend a criminal rather the hope is to illustrate or illuminate something largely unseen by our culture in this way photography is a process of enlarging meaning not a police exercise perhaps its just semantics but i prefer to think of the photographer as illustrator rather than stenographer or cop

1150068 lonza misled the public but epa is turning this situation into a positive by overseeing this quality assurance program and sending a message to others that these deceptive actions will not be tolerated
1150069 i had this specially made and when i leave tomorrow well if youre ever in really big trouble if you ever need help and im talking oh shit im going to die kind of help you can push down on that ring around the edge and i will be there
1150070 what are you talking about is this like a walkie talkie or something i already have your cel phone number
1150071 not now you idiot tell you what tomorrow night at midnight go out to the edge of the woods and press it youll see what happens
1150072 why did it take you so long to get here
1150073 youve heard the stories coming out of nova city about the sun knight the golden warrior
1150074 youre about to go into the big bad world little brother and i just wanted you to
1150075 this from the guy who used to hold me down so he could fart in my face
1150076 the significance of this is for other groups of patients with neurological impairment
1150077 do all of these patients have the same mechanism for reflux and swallowing disorders if not performing a fundoplication anti reflux surgery may not help in fact it may make things worse like it did in the rett girls
1150078 this issue is of particular interest to pediatricians who refer these patients for their reflux problems
1150079 if we develop a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the problems being experienced by these children we just might be able to find a way to make life a little more comfortable for them
1150080 if all incompatible donors and recipients were simply listed in one common pool the problems related to incompatible and poorly matched donors and recipients would be a thing of the past
1150081 newyork presbyterian weill cornell introduced the registry to ucla a few months ago prompting ucla to join the innovative program
1150082 this is a rare instance of a living donor kidney being shipped across the country to initiate a chain
1150083 if we can become comfortable shipping living donor kidneys like we do with deceased donor kidneys then thousands of patients will have the opportunity to receive a kidney who otherwise would have been forced to remain on dialysis
1150084 the hope is that this marks the first of many such collaborations among the nations transplant centers
1150085 donor chains have enormous potential to expand the donor pool and to provide better matched organs for the many individuals who are in desperate need of lifesaving transplants
1150086 kidney donor chains could have a significant impact on the countrys organ donor shortage
1150087 whereas the chain involves an extra donor in the beginning so you can initiate a self propagating cascade
1150088 but in this case ucla received a live donor kidney from new york which hasnt been done before
1150089 living donor exchange represents the pinnacle of teamwork and professional and personal trust and good faith that ideally epitomizes the organ transplant endeavor
1150090 the team consists of surgeons physicians nurses coordinators patients and donors all working together toward the same goal
1150091 patients can wait up to eight years for a deceased donor transplant
1150092 this donor chain may enable hundreds of patients to receive a kidney thanks to one generous altruistic donor rather than in the past where only one patient benefited from an altruistic donor this could significantly decrease the waiting list for kidney transplantation
1150093 i have had the incredibly sad experience of having a colleague die while waiting for a kidney transplant
1150094 i have a close friend who donated a kidney to her brother and i have a close friend who received a kidney more than a decade ago and i see the terrific experiences shes had since
1150095 when i started thinking about it i thought im able and healthy at this point in my life to do this to help someone have more years of a better life why not donate the beauty of this partnership between excellent doctors transplant coordinators and staff at newyork presbyterian weill cornell ucla and a group of seven people a partnership connecting both coasts is that a chain of people have better lives and the chain goes on
1150096 if we can get this exchange program going its going to be the answer to lots of peoples situations
1150097 this is going to help so many people down the line
1150098 pam couldnt sit on the transplant wait list for several years something needed to be done im glad i could do my part to help
1150099 everyone would benefit if more donated today its me tomorrow its someone else
1150100 it was like a closed door that is now being opened again
1150101 randy and i talked about it and we said ok hes willing to give to somebody else and i wont have to take as many medications after the surgery
1150102 the fdas regulatory decisions affect the health of millions of americans and we dont make those decisions in a vacuum
1150103 its imperative that we seek advice from independent experts and that we do so in a way that is public open and transparent todays announcement strengthens our processes
1150104 i tried just about everything then the last thing we tried seemed to work well it turned around in about three or four days
1150105 he should have a nice fresh arm between now and the end of the year
1150106 hopefully we can get it done the next couple of days every thing is fine
1150107 ive missed time before but its frustrating when its something as small as this you miss some games and not part of the action in a pennant race its no fun to just be watching

1150115 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1150116 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1150117 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1150118 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1150119 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1150120 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
1150121 vivienne marcheline et knox leon jolie pitt une tonne de nouvelles images
1150122 she was supposed to meet me here half an hour ago she was looking forward to her first night back in real society
1150123 like she didnt nearly deliver chloe on the steps of the courthouse
1150124 then she took six months off shes going stir crazy
1150125 hold chloe for a while theres someone i need to find
1150126 but the sitter showed up and seemed a little a little off i guess and i thought what better way to get at us than through chloe and what if this woman was replaced with some evil robot clone thing and i just couldnt leave her and i couldnt stay away either so i brought her with me
1150127 oh no chlo not a toy definitely not a toy
1150128 this whole thing is just a little creepy i mean these things that happened people actually died all this stuff here its like were at disaster disneyland
1150129 it feels very strange now to look at some of this stuff
1150130 well you know but i guess this stuff here its powerless now it cant hurt us we made sure of it so really this exhibit can be here to remind people that theyre safe from all of it now
1150131 i had a hard enough time getting it tied as it is
1150132 im going to need a minute if im going to re tie this stupid thing
1150133 guys small child and little brother present and wed like to register and official eww
1150134 ive got my lady at my side for the first time in a long time not to mention my best girl
1150135 seriously though honey you know i had the sitter checked out right she was someone claire recommended and i even had derek trent run her file with the ncib
1150136 careful honey i dont think youre meant to touch that
1150137 ive attended several national conferences and cit was by far the best i came home with an overwhelming amount of information
1150138 this was my first league conference and i was extremely pleased
1150139 excellent conference i packed in a lot of very usable information and techniques in a short amount of time
1150140 i thoroughly enjoyed the conference my head is stuffed with new ideas and plans for our institution
1150141 one of the best conferences i have attended in recent years
1150142 it was good to rub shoulders with others who love learning and are committed to excellence in higher education especially in the area of technology
1150143 i look forward to attending next years cit and plan on recommending that more colleagues attend
1150144 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1150145 even at todays price as you know 14 airlines have gone out of business while others are hovering on the brink of bankruptcy and most have curtailed service and laid off personnel
1150146 at double or triple todays price none could fly unless nationalized a whole range of other industries would be quickly drawn into the quicksand ironically war would push america into a form of socialist economy
1150147 so the lights are on late in washingtons federal reserve sec and treasury department trying to figure out how socialism your tax dollars and credits can once again bail out these big time gamblers with our money reckless self enriching capitalists get on your knees and thank the rescuing washington socialists for without them you would surely be in chains
1150148 american fascists the christian right and the war on america
1150149 a change of that magnitude is more than we have seen in 20 million years
1150150 if we had wanted to destroy as much of life on earth as possible there would have been no better way of doing it than to dig up and burn as much fossil hydrocarbon as we possible could
1150151 i have enough money to take care of my family for generations im still playing because i love baseball i still have something to accomplish
1150152 trey tells me i should keep playing until he goes to college
1150153 because he knows that as long as im playing im not around to enforce the rules hes a smart kid
1150154 as soon as we have something we will announce it
1150155 its the same as when i was asked a week ago i have nothing to report i will comment to you when i hear something
1150156 if i made comments every time i heard a rumor ill be talking to you every day and have to answer every question you ask lets deal with reality well let you guys know when we know something
1150157 he doesnt deserve any of that because he is not a bad guy
1150158 i was so excited to be back out there pitching
1150159 i didnt take it for granted i tried to enjoy it more and appreciated it more than i did before i got hurt
1150160 to buy cheap fabrics garish jewelry or fake designer goods which we dont and 2 chinatown is so close the great chinese restaurants there dont need to advertise to the non chinese residents nearby and if they do it is usually of the poor quality flyers done by a machine from the typewriter era on cheap paper and runny pinkish ink

1150162 81 percent of incoming k families get one of their choices
1150163 one of the real benefits out of this particular roof is that it reduces the heat load that this particular building experiences
1150164 it reduces the amount of heat that our equipment has on the roof it reduces the load that is inside the building and it ultimately allow us to reduce our energy consumption in the building and that pays off in dollars
1150165 and to all of those who came home to have the purple hearts and their medals to show in their display cases were the lucky ones
1150166 the friends we left on the battlefield well mourn em forever
1150167 we may not have got all of matt home but hes here and i just want to say thank you for all the prayers and support we got
1150168 mr terrys selfless act of putting others before himself is why we are honoring him today
1150169 and i believe why the lord wanted him to live
1150170 its a good feeling that people come together to do this
1150171 if you support this youre making a very very strong statement to small businesses city wide our small businesses in clifton need that plaza in order to have a more customer friendly environment
1150172 what up home boy eagle packed come by were on the roof
1150173 union square is close to home but not that close and im more close to the eagle now than if i were at home maybe i should just go
1150174 my foot does hurt but come on this is the summer and its late saturday night with the options of countless familiar and unfamiliar shirtless men drinking beer in the open air yup i can walk this off
1150175 east village east village who do i know in the east village josh josh is home i know that for sure
1150176 hey josh i think i need your help you know where i can get crutches
1150177 you can feel like a pussy for a week and let this heal in 10 days or you can not use the crutches at all and let this minor injury heal in a month
1150178 what we gave the officers was what they would probably actually encounter when they went to enter the building
1150179 there were a bunch of people who were playing roles of victims
1150180 theyre in there yelling theyre crying for help some of them had injuries there were people shot people unconscious people who were just confused didnt know what to do
1150181 its just amazing all the people here and how nice they are how they pay for our meals and our lodging
1150182 hearing the diagnosis initially your mind kinda does strange things and they say no dont worry were gonna take care of everything which really helps
1150183 they give you everything they give you everything and ask for nothing
1150184 weve been very fortunate they take care of everything for you and take that stress away
1150185 second stimulus package that includes investments in our nations infrastructure
1150186 i was very very scared i was very upset i got a very big lesson that i had to learn today that i will never ever leave him alone not even for two seconds
1150187 at that point i spoke with the boy i gave him a stuffed animal and took custody of him the information we had at that point was that the mother was still at the greyhound bus station but a grants pass police officer was out with her so i was able to telephone the mother on cell phone and allow her to speak to her son on the phone which calmed things down significantly
1150188 thanks to the law enforcement around here i really appreciate everything theyve done for me and my son
1150189 why on earth even contemplate spending money on the bhp site
1150190 why not put that money straight into a proposal somewhere between tumby bay and arno bay wherever is the best location
1150191 were all about big portions my mother always was into flavoring food a lot and that is what i plan to present to the audience in big daddys house
1150192 i actually never sent anything in my wife had my hands tied she sent in my audition tape
1150193 i walked in thinking i had a chance to win week to week they took me on a rollercoaster ride but i never gave up believing in my chance of winning
1150194 my food presented on the show is going to be wide open in style and presentation my main goal is teaching people to use what they have at home in preparing their meals
1150195 my favourite family food tradition had to be fish on fridays and because of my italian background with a roman catholic upbringing i would always prepare pasta on wednesdays so on fridays i started to combine the two into a unique dish to serve to my family
1150196 the history is very important i call my food soul food but i keep it with an ethnic twist its about food that is flavourful and fun
1150197 my plan is to just get people to tune into my show with my show big daddys house there will be no competition i can be myself having fun and cooking
1150198 meeting the nine other finalists building relationships and getting good ideas from all of them
1150199 i look at everyone as an equal i feel like a star everyday i wake up
1150200 i love coors light cold but if i could eat anything my perfect meal would be a 16 to 18 ounce new york steak cooked medium with aparagus and fried mushrooms to start off i would have one of my salads with a special dressing and one of my homemade soups
1150201 i became a serious eater at the age of 4 i was served one piece of fried chicken and thought to myself when i get older ill cook my own whole chicken so i can eat it my friends and family think im a food junkie i go to work and cook i come home and cook i spend weekends cooking with my family i just am obsessed with cooking and i want to show the world what i can do and i think big daddys house will be the place to do it
1150202 people who think that cats cant love have never been loved by a cat
1150203 i certainly think australian homeowners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank
1150204 we have put in place a very big relief package for families we have tax cuts in the system for people who are impacted on by rising prices and on top of that there are positives in the australian economy
1150205 theres been eight interest rate rises in a row and on top of that weve had a global oil shock and on top of that weve had the increase in borrowing costs in both households and business and of course that has put both business and households under tremendous pressure
1150206 he has to say that his government accepts theres an issue and hes got the policies to combat it
1150207 when it comes to skilling up tasmanians when it comes to the cost of living in this place when it comes to providing appropriate transport infrastructure to allow business to prosper they are all things that this government can control
1150208 what weve got is a government mired in the past
1150209 theres a lot more floor area thats going into the scheme
1150210 thats not necessarily a problem per se because the city can accommodate a lot of space but i think whats worrying is that the buildings are becoming bigger and fatter in the process getting supersized the connection from the city to the harbour might well be compromised
1150211 if that was to be approved it would be all delivered in the southern commercial precinct
1150212 the southern commercial precinct is already approved with existing building envelopes and the 120 000 square metres would be delivered within those building envelopes so the overshadowing and the wind effectuation is being taken into account
1150213 its just a matter of whether the community wishes to be involved in the process and the future of the lake or if they just want it to just revert to how its been
1150214 some of the best managed wetlands have been managed well by community getting together and developing a management plan and then having ownership of both the plan and the wetland for the benefit of everybody
1150215 sometimes its good for local government to get involved and sometimes theyre better off getting out of the way
1150216 well leave each of the councils to come to grips with this issue in their own way
1150217 it has been said that ibn umar and a group of the messenger of allahs companions who lived after him in madinah would issue verdicts based on the madhhab of zayd bin thabit and the knowledge they had acquired from him that was not addressed by what they had learned from the messenger of allahs words
1150218 when the abdullahs died abdullah bin abbas abdullah bin az zubayr and abdullah bin amr bin al as all the knowledge that was present in all the lands was left in the hands of their servants so the scholar of people of makkah was ata bin abi rabah the scholar of yemen was tawus the scholar of yamamah was yahya bin abi kathir the scholar of kufah was ibrahim the scholar of basrah was al hasan the scholar of sham was makhul and the scholar of khurasan was ata al khurasani all except madinah as allah had reserved this position for a qurashi so the scholar of madinah was said bin al musayyab without dispute
1150219 if the messenger of allah had seen this it would have made him very happy
1150220 i ask allah to gather you and i in the marketplaces of paradise
1150221 this is a great opportunity to have some fun and learn more about keeping our neighborhoods safe
1150222 i invite all milwaukee county residents to stop by and enjoy this free event
1150223 weve seen a lot of kids who are aware of it more kids know about it than are actually using it its not classified but it probably should be
1150224 we were all on the internet researching it but then things died down
1150225 because its so easy to obtain and not regulated its something the medical community is talking about
1150226 because we know the internet spreads the word and because we know theres a great deal of information on the internet the sense was that it was important to address it
1150227 flanagan sees it as a gateway drug to harsher drugs he decided that if the federal government wasnt going to do anything he would try to do something here
1150228 currently there is a lack of information regarding plants or weeds commonly found in our environment that can cause serious legal harm when ingested smoked or rubbed into the skin most of these substances are not illegal research suggests that teen misuse of these weeds and plants increases when they are in bloom in the spring and summer months though they can be used year round and could possibly be purchased over the internet
1150229 the communist party forbade membership to homosexuals on the grounds that homosexuality was symptomatic of bourgeois decadence a perversion a byproduct of capitalism and fascism it also viewed homosexuality like drug use as a security risk that would make individuals susceptible to blackmail or exposure that would discredit it
1150230 although he left the communist party hay brought many residues of his stalinism with him the partys habits of organization combined with the circumstances of mccarthyism and anti gay repression which demanded at least some modicum of discretion led hay to conceive of mattachine as a hierarchical organization led by an inner circle while maintaining the secrecy of the underground
1150231 made no official prohibition against same sex desire and had no official ideology against it
1150232 no one was ever expelled from the socialist party or
1150233 could write freely without fear of suppression within the left such as the expulsions gay communists experienced ypsl members in the 1950s were attracted to libertarian socialism evincing for example a strong interest in rosa luxemburg the polish german revolutionary who supported the russian revolution but was critical of the early soviet state for its ominous consolidation of power
1150234 the freedom of the legally of age adult of both sexes to have sexual relations with whomever he or she wishes of the same or opposite sex without fear of sanction is an important libertarian principle that is part of the law in many socialist and semi socialist countries today e g in sweden norway the netherlands etc it means to the individual deviant that the fear of legal sanction as well as illegal repression blackmail etc are forever banished from his mind it means an area of operational freedom that will enable the emancipated individual to work and think more effectively in his tasks of everyday life it means the difference between health and sickness for thousands of people who are non productive members of society today whether we individually consider it right or wrong healthy or unhealthy to have a large or small vocabulary of libidinal expression repression of such expression or practice under fear does not make for a whole productive individual propaganda aimed toward the homosexual individual should stress his importance as a political concern it should point out his right to what the declaration of independence called the pursuit of happiness
1150235 prefigured the 1960s it urged socialists to understand the genesis of political commitment and their ultimate goals in a capacious sense transcending narrow economic terms it treated sexuality as a political issue comprehending the interrelationship between personal and public in a manner strikingly similar to the subsequent feminist position that the personal is political while the scant intellectual resources available to a young person exploring such questions in the early 1950s lent the article a modest temperament the document contains in embryonic form the admixture of socialism and gay liberation that would find more militant revolutionary expression in the post stonewall explosion of such groups as the gay liberation front for all these reasons socialism and sex is a document of great significance in the larger sexual history of the political left it stands as an arresting forerunner of modern gay civil rights consciousness
1150236 was instructed by the ypsl to attempt to put a homosexual rights plank before the platform committee
1150237 he said well vern if the ypsl thinks thats something that we
1150238 i just couldnt write anything that seemed to fit into the platform so i let it slide by i had no guidance we didnt talk about discrimination based on sexual orientation in those days that phrase would never have come to me and everything was going fast we were fighting over the korean war and everything and it didnt get done and i take responsibility but i believe to this day had i been able to do my job thomas would have joined me and we would have had it back then in 52
1150239 this membership rebellion reflective of widespread distrust of the initial conspiratorial and top down structure coincided with threatened inquiry by congressional investigative committees prompting hay and other radical founders to withdraw from mattachine in 1953 as its new and more conservative leaders sought respectability the mattachine society lost many members and pursued a timid self effacing course
1150240 intimate politics how i grew up red fought for free speech and became a feminist rebel
1150241 i was really surprised by how little activism there was
1150242 the question in my mind was what is it about these times that makes us feel that resistance is futile
1150243 and what would it feel like to believe you were part of a movement that could change history what would it feel like to believe you had the power to join together with your peers and change the political future of your country
1150244 if this project goes forward im struck by how powerful the experience is of standing in a park in the same place where a speech was given forty years ago and hearing how relevant it is

1150246 this is the most ridiculous thing we know this is not going to work
1150247 how can they ask us to self deport when they know our country depends on the money we send to accept this new proposal means we are accepting abandoning our families
1150248 we figured if we got in great if not we at least had fun finding the outfits
1150249 they said they might be interested in recruiting our dog

1150251 they asked me if i would do a nude shot and i said oh yeah
1150252 bloated self preserving federal bureaucracy whose power budget and continuing existence bear no relation to its performance
1150253 i read walden two throughout one day breaking only to get up and
1150254 my mother was disappointed that twin oaks did not turn out to be the model for what the rest of our society would be
1150255 when she found out that it was really just a nice place for some middle class people to live she was disappointed
1150256 and she started a new commune that also frustrated and disappointed her she ventured into the outside world for a while then surprised herself by coming back
1150257 each member receives food housing health care and personal spending money from the community whose income derives primarily from making high quality rope hammocks and casual furniture
1150258 my mother was disappointed that twin oaks did not turn out to be the model for what the rest of our society would be when she found out that it was really just a nice place for some middle class people to live she was disappointed
1150259 they really thought that the rest of the world would see their community and follow its example
1150260 today i think twin oaks sees itself more as an eco village living lightly on the land
1150261 20 more minutes of agony feed a family of four for 2 25

1150263 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1150264 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1150265 when i would be playing with brass bands in the uptown section of new orleans louis would steal off from home and follow me during that time louis started after me to show him how to blow my cornet when the band would not be playing i would let him carry it to please him how he wanted me to teach him how to play the blues and ball the jack and animal ball circus day take it away and didnt he ramble and out of all those pieces he liked the blues the best i took a job playing in a tonk for dago tony on perdido and franklin street and louis used to slip in there and get on the music stand behind the piano he would fool around with my cornet every chance he got i showed him just how to hold it and place it to his mouth and he did so and it wasnt long before he began getting a good tone out of my horn then i began showing him just how to start the blues and little by little he began to understand
1150266 now here is the year louis started it was in the latter part of 1911 as close as i can think louis was about 11 years old now ive said a lot about my boy louis and just how he started playing cornet he started playing it by head
1150267 at first he was actually a member of the lil hardin armstrong band and working for his wife
1150268 er blijft altijd nog een prijsverschil maar dat is niet meer zo groot
1150269 de meeste zogenaamde natuurlijke cosmetica en huidverzorgingsproducten zijn niet 100 procent natuurzuiver
1150270 al telt een verzorgingsproduct n natuurlijk bestanddeel dan mag het toch als natuurlijk verkocht worden
1150271 ik ben veertig jaar werkzaam in de cosmeticabranche in die tijd heb ik voldoende kennis opgebouwd om me te realiseren dat verreweg de meeste cosmetica rotzooi is die niet waarmaakt wat beloofd wordt acht jaar geleden besloot ik daarom dat ik alleen nog 100 procent natuurlijke producten wilde maken
1150272 natuurproducten zijn niet per definitie beter voor de mens de natuur bevat talloze producten die de huid behoorlijk kunnen irriteren
1150273 mensen denken al snel dat alles wat natuurlijk is ook gezond is fabrikanten van verzorgingsproducten spelen daar op in
1150274 wellness gaat niet meer alleen over er mooi uitzien maar vooral over je goed voelen het kopen van eco producten geeft consumenten het gevoel dat ze goed bezig zijn

1150278 roetfilters zullen de luchtkwaliteit rond snelwegen op termijn verbeteren maar gemeenten kunnen daar niet op wachten
1150279 gemeenten willen een eigen perspectief hebben daarom komt amsterdam met een milieuzone en steken de twintig gemeenten van onze stadsregio zes ton in deze proef

1150285 in het oude stelsel kregen de ziekenhuizen jaarlijks een budget toegewezen aan de hand van nogal grove parameters zoals geschat aantal opnames en het aantal inwoners van de regio dat door het ziekenhuis wordt bediend werd dat vastgesteld bij overschrijding van het budget werd de kaasschaafmethode toegepast maar hoeveel een bepaalde verrichting kostte de ziekenhuizen hadden geen idee dankzij de dbcs en de kostprijzen die het amc inmiddels jaarlijks voor alle ziekenhuisactiviteiten berekent zijn de kosten per pati nt en per pati ntengroep nu wel inzichtelijk dat is een grote vooruitgang het heeft me verbaasd dat er helemaal geen inzicht was in de kostprijs per pati nt terwijl er veel geld in omgaat
1150286 het kan zijn dat een verrichting meer kost dan oplevert moet de directie dan maar besluiten die behandeling aan andere ziekenhuizen over te laten nee niet per se je moet ook kijken naar de relevantie in een universitair medisch centrum umc als het onze kan het zijn dat je een bepaalde pati ntengroep toch in huis wilt houden voor onderwijs of onderzoek of je neemt nog eens kritisch de kosten onder de loep waarom zijn die zo hoog en is dat wel nodig maar valt er niets aan de kosten te doen en is de pati ntengroep voor het ziekenhuis ook niet relevant te maken dan kun je in overleg met ziekenhuizen in de regio proberen pati ntenstromen te verleggen in het kader van taakverdeling en concentratie
1150287 dat hoeft helemaal niet in het amc gaan we eerst bij de medische afdelingen te rade wat is voor jullie relevant daarna wordt berekend wat dit financieel betekent zo wordt er een koppeling gelegd tussen het medisch en het financi le beleid vroeger gebeurde dat nauwelijks
1150288 de dbcs dwingen ziekenhuizen na te denken over hun activiteiten mijn systeem maakt het mogelijk keuzes te maken op basis van objectievere informatie dan voorheen vroeger werden ook keuzes gemaakt maar dan op basis van pressie van belangengroepen binnen ziekenhuizen
1150289 de reacties van de medische afdelingen op de informatie uit mijn systeem vari ren van fantastisch dat het er is tot waardeloos zo wil ik niet werken soms schrik ik van de impact die deze nieuwe informatie heeft op het handelen van mensen ik ben bezig met een proefschrift over de vraag hoe op de afdelingen met de informatie wordt omgegaan die mijn systeem oplevert mijn onderzoek richt zich op de medische afdelingshoofden de sleutelfiguren de medisch specialisten die tegelijk manager zijn wat doen ze met de informatie die boven water komt verandert hun manier van besluitvorming lopen ze ermee naar de raad van bestuur om extra budget te vragen zijn ze bereid pati ntgroepen af te stoten kijken ze jaloers naar collegas die een winstgevende afdeling leiden en andersom krijgen collegas die een dure afdeling hebben verwijten wat betekent dit alles voor de samenwerking met de raad van bestuur wordt die beter of juist niet
1150290 zon tarief wordt eerst landelijk vastgesteld het is een soort richttarief gebaseerd op wat zon dbc gemiddeld in een kleine groep nederlandse ziekenhuizen kost natuurlijk redeneren de verzekeraars we gaan niet meer betalen dan dat gemiddelde in de vrije onderhandelingen is dit voor umcs en topklinische ziekenhuizen wel een probleem we merken dat het in de afspraken met verzekeraars lastig is om de koppeling tussen inhoud kwaliteit en prijs te maken een hogere prijs voor dbcs waarin ons ziekenhuis zwaardere pati nten behandelt is bijna niet af te spreken uiteindelijk gaat het de zorgverzekeraar erom om onder de streep gunstig uit te komen
1150291 die topziekenhuizen schieten er bij in omdat de zorg die ze leveren duurder is dan gemiddeld nu is er wel een apart potje voor de meerkosten die umcs maken vergeleken met andere ziekenhuizen daar zit voor alle umcs 500 miljoen in het amc krijgt 90 miljoen maar stel dat de bekostiging in de toekomst alleen gebeurt op basis van dbcs dan hebben we een groot probleem de pati nten in universitair medische centra zijn nu eenmaal heel moeilijk te standaardiseren dbcs houden geen rekening met zorgzwaarte neem kinderoncologie als een pati ntje hier een jaar ligt dan zijn de kosten extreem veel hoger dan gemiddeld gelukkig komt er waarschijnlijk in 2010 een aparte regeling voor dit soort pati nten
1150292 wie denkt dat dit hier nog gebruikt kan worden het is pure afvaldumping om het hierheen te sturen en we kunnen deze spullen absoluut niet verantwoord verwerken

1150336 a heightened focus on regulatory compliance issues should ensure that corporate and securities law will remain a top practice area in the future
1150337 litigation also is expected to produce a significant volume of casework and intensify demand for legal professionals with relevant experience
1150338 but if the bubble bursts there is a lot of looking behind doors to find out whether anyone cut corners with respect to compliance and that means a lot of work for the lawyers
1150339 when something happens to cause a downturn or a distortion in the markets then the response of the government is more regulation the subprime meltdown the loss of confidence in the financial industry the downturns in banks every day you see new regulations coming into place and of course that makes more work for securities lawyers
1150340 regulatory counseling is very big and it will continue to grow
1150341 given my holocaust background albeit one generation removed from the horror it should come as no surprise that i became a public interest lawyer working in the areas of civil rights death penalty and poverty law
1150342 the government had this tremendous power to make a difference
1150343 but politics and ideology intervened and there was less and less will to use this powerful instrument we had
1150344 it quickly became clear to me that no matter how much i did the line of those in need was much longer
1150345 ive found that you can never judge a lawyers passion for a cause by where they work because you can always find people who defy expectations
1150346 thats partly because firms have grown and overall hours have grown but pro bono hours have certainly grown faster than overall hours
1150347 were just lucky today to have leaders at major law firms and legal departments that are what i call pbjs pro bono junkies peers who lead firms that are very financially successful and have a great deal of status and can demonstrate it doesnt diminish the bottom line to do pro bono
1150348 i also think it is a part of the post 9 11 world and a real sense that the rule of law and justice and fairness are critically important
1150349 prosecutors are on the front lines like federal agents they are the face of federal law enforcement
1150350 they are dealing with pretty dangerous people and have a legitimate gripe for the job they do they deserve more protection
1150351 it may sound like a small thing but its a big deal
1150352 i would endorse the concept of secured parking going to a public lot is an unnecessary risk youre a sitting duck

1150354 a lawyer shall not make a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge adjudicatory official or public legal officer or of a candidate for election or appointment to judicial or legal office
1150355 with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it was false or true
1150356 if an attorneys activity or speech is protected by the first amendment the disciplinary rules governing the legal profession cannot punish the attorneys conduct
1150357 those circumstances characterize you the judge as a racist and bigot for racially stereotyping me as unable to be an attorney because i was black
1150358 i am entitled to and i affirm my right not to have my attorney fees determined by a racist judge your dilatoriness in recusing yourself is delaying determination of my fee by a replacement judge i want my fee determined promptly by another judge i need not remind you of the dilatoriness standard for judges
1150359 brought a complaint against the lawyer charging him with violating
1150360 the right of a lawyer as a citizen to publicly criticize adjudicatory officials is particularly meaningful where as in texas the adjudicatory officials are selected through the elective system
1150361 the judges have now made it eloquently clear where their sympathies lie in regard to aggressive vice investigations by refusing to authorize use of the das funds to pay for the cost of closing down the canal street clip joints this raises interesting questions about the racketeer influences on our eight vacation minded judges
1150362 made a variety of unsupported allegations against several judges attorneys court personnel and members of the public
1150363 either with actual knowledge of the falsity of said accusations or with reckless disregard of whether they were true or false

1150398 we think that there has been a drastic reduction in confidence in small names
1150399 we estimate there is a 30 preference amongst customers for larger brands even if their products are more expensive so there is an exodus from small banks to large ones
1150400 thats very good for the big banks in the long term although in the meantime they have to get over the sub prime crisis
1150401 many of the older drugs are coming to the end of their patents and the big companies need new products to fill their pipeline

1150424 how many of you have only learned to speak english in the last few years
1150425 how many of you had very little school experience before you came to our school
1150426 do you have people at home to push and help you people to pay for extra lessons no so you will have got your a levels because of your own efforts in spite of difficulties that those private school kids never even thought of
1150427 when you get to university you will all have plenty of untapped potential but maybe those pupils crammed to the eyeballs in private schools may never get any better you will have proved you can work hard in hard circumstances with no spoon feeding you know what it is to work despite a lot of distraction and lots of temptations
1150428 the builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two storey suburban villa with pitched roofs end gables front porch picture windows chimneys and so forth
1150429 there is usually nothing about the ecohouse to signal that it is a new kind of energy efficient machine for living in
1150430 the slate in the roof may be recycled but with so many solar panels skylights sun tunnels and windows in it and on it theres no good reason for it being made of slate at all
1150431 explicitly believe in addressing a breach in one of societys central relationships between the top and bottom rich and poor
1150432 we have pledged to share the proceeds of growth so that government grows more slowly than the trend rate of the economy so government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp
1150433 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
1150434 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
1150435 the word for hazel whose nut does have associations with supernatural wisdom in medieval irish tradition is coll plural cuill
1150436 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
1150437 we were no longer able to burn our rubbish so we thought the best policy was not to produce any in the first place
1150438 i was working when the scheme started and found myself spending my lunch break dealing with our rubbish
1150439 it took ages to sort everything into different types but it comes naturally now
1150440 were still some way from reaching our zero waste goal but the difference is amazing compared with a few years ago
1150441 i cant say with absolute confidence that we will reach the target but were doing our best to make it happen
1150442 we still have opponents particularly because almost everything has to be washed
1150443 all we can do is talk to the doubters and explain why what theyre doing is so important i think consciousness is growing that this is a good thing that its not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do
1150444 etss problem masks a more endemic massive failure of sats that runs right through the system this is vanity testing so government can feel good about whats happening in primaries and show results are improving but its expensive for primaries not trusted by secondaries and damaging for children
1150445 there is an issue wider than the problems with ets school test results are not a reliable indicator of pupil performance
1150446 we are considering a boycott but some naht members think that wouldnt be a professional response despite the strength of feeling against sats
1150447 i have sympathy with that view but if you got to the point where there is a head of steam throughout the education community against sats and the response from the government is that there will be absolutely no negotiations then eventually you come to a situation where only a very strong campaign will have an effect
1150448 tests have changed several times over the period theyve been around trying to assess standards across the system over time using these tests is of relatively little value if you want to know how a system is performing you only need to test a sample not every 11 and 14 year old in the country
1150449 it is a tragedy that hundreds of thousands will join the millions who have left primary school unable to master the basics in the 3rs basics that are the keystone of future opportunity and success
1150450 standards in our schools are rising and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test
1150451 we are already trialling changes to testing which allow teachers to choose when their pupils take new single level tests
1150452 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1150453 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1150454 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1150455 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1150456 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1150457 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1150458 appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing disorder itself is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour
1150459 explicitly believe in addressing a breach in one of societys central relationships between the top and bottom rich and poor
1150460 we have pledged to share the proceeds of growth so that government grows more slowly than the trend rate of the economy so government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp

1150467 as good a shape as it could be to weather the storm
1150468 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1150469 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1150470 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1150471 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1150472 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1150473 but you dont have a say in making something a hit you can only try on the other hand a long tail approach collecting many many products among the tail
1150474 permits you to amalgamate a market that may be just as big or bigger than the short head
1150475 i am a creative planner brand and social media consultant based in bangalore india this blog is a scribbling pad for my thots and ideas on
1150476 the idea is to treat the elements like you would a real desktop putting temporary or urgent matters on the note things you havent yet organized into the outer parts of the desk and personal or work projects divided between the board and sheet for example

1150481 unnecessary printing of emails multiple copies single sided printing and the sending of massive documents to the printer which are unlikely to be read are just some of the regular scenarios lived out by businesses every day
1150482 most offices will find they can reduce waste costs by around 20 through simple no or low cost actions measures such as double sided or multiple page printing and recycling instead of paying for disposal can really help
1150483 4 is an average but weve found some manufacturing companies can save as much as 10 of their turnover
1150484 the builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two storey suburban villa with pitched roofs end gables front porch picture windows chimneys and so forth

1150493 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1150494 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1150495 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1150496 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1150497 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1150498 oh my god i saw a man carrying a girl

1150500 the newspaper wishes to make clear that it wasnt in any way anti polish
1150501 we are pleased that the daily mail could see that some of the wording they had in their headlines was harmful and they have taken far more care
1150502 i think that is a fair characterisation rather than a slur
1150503 if you buy the ftse you are not buying the uk economy
1150504 it is a truism that emerging markets hold up until they dont
1150505 they are largely about momentum and as long as they are going up they are doing well but when they fall they fall the furthest
1150506 the ones that became hot spots then collapsed vietnam doubled and halved shanghai tripled and then halved again the stockmarkets that didnt attract large amounts of foreign investors in the past werent subject to the same excess or capital flight
1150507 our view is that oil prices are likely to fall and they could be in for a rocky ride
1150508 if you are infected so am i were going to get out of this together the way we have overcome every other problem
1150509 we are sending out requests to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

1150512 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1150513 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1150514 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1150515 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1150516 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1150517 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1150518 this information will be considered by the lawyers and by the private investigators who are still looking for madeleine
1150519 anybody reading it needs to do so in the context of kate and gerrys arguido status having been lifted
1150520 the search for madeleine goes on kate and gerry are realistic they know there is a possibility that madeleine could be dead and could be long dead however there is absolutely no evidence that she is dead and because of that total absence of evidence they have to cling to the hope that she could well be alive
1150521 our belief that karadzic is different that he is a monster and nothing like us
1150522 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
1150523 everything was going well to camp four at 7 800m and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1150524 that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1150525 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1150526 i would like everyone to be able to contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers i am suffering for it but its too beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
1150527 k2 is the peak to climb in the himalayas it is a pyramid of rock with very little snow and a lot of ice
1150528 it is not like everest where there are fixed ropes bottled oxygen and sherpas who set camps and carry loads which make it possible for less practiced climbers those who take on the challenge of k2 are the best they have the right people and the right idea they will turn back but it is the unknown and unpredictable factors that make it so dangerous
1150529 after mughniyehs assassination the president apparently stripped shawkat of many of his powers
1150530 suleiman would have been involved in that process and it was known that shawkat hated suleiman
1150531 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hizbullah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel
1150532 the assassination means there is a power struggle going on in syria and it most probably concerns iran people like this dont just die unless something is going on
1150533 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1150534 i was having breakfast at about 8am when i heard two or three loud bangs they sounded like a car backfiring so i didnt pay much attention until later when i heard some police had been killed
1150535 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1150536 theres an independence movement but i dont expect it to succeed and dont expect many people will want to take part because they expect it to fail and know the result will be more repression
1150537 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
1150538 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1150539 if we pass on all costs to the consumer it will affect demand and if we dont it will affect margins
1150540 i cant see the 100 000 rupee price being maintained for more than three months largely to let ratan tata keep his price promise before the company raises it
1150541 sanjay jha is very well connected in the mobile industry and knows the challenges facing him taking on that role is a hugely daunting task but i think he has the personality to pull the company forward
1150542 hes very knowledgable and very no nonsense but i dont know if he has enough vision to turn things around in terms of design and brand
1150543 i guess we can talk about football if anybody wants id be all for that
1150544 its sad it certainly has been a distraction theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction
1150545 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1150546 you feel sick said richt that one of the guys you love and you care for has gotten himself in trouble you hate the fact that these guys represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state and anybody who claims to be a bulldog

1150552 how do we tackle this problem before it turns into a major fire an epidemic
1150553 to recruit a doctor willing to work with drug users is a nightmare
1150554 dass die menschen vor den olympischen spielen die menschenrechte nicht vergessen
1150555 ich werde mir die spiele nicht ansehen denn das w rde bedeuten die propaganda des kommunistischen regimes in peking zu unterst tzen
1150556 sie repr sentieren die anderen v lker dabei repr sentieren sie nicht die meinung aller b rger zu denen auch ich geh re sie vertreten ihre eigene meinung und es geht ihnen eher um macht und einfluss in china und das ist f r den gro teil der menschen nicht gut
1150557 man kann es gar nicht fassen dass es so etwas gibt dazu finde ich einfach keine worte wenn hier nicht darauf hingewiesen w rde w rde man gar nichts davon erfahren das ist ein absolutes unrecht
1150558 die d rften in china gar nicht stattfinden wenn ein land so mit menschen umgeht darf es die spiele nicht bekommen die olympischen spiele stehen f r freiheit und freundschaft und fairness dass die spiele jetzt in china stattfinden kann ich einfach nicht begreifen
1150559 davon halte ich nichts es gibt doch sehr viele beweise die die menschenrechtsverletzungen in china belegen diejenigen die so etwas unterst tzen k nnen meiner meinung nach kein gewissen mehr haben
1150560 das ist doch keine freiheit wenn man im eigenen land nicht frei reisen kann ich habe fr her die diktatur am eigenen leib erfahren wir wurden festgenommen wenn wir uns zu dicht an der grenze aufhielten dann haben sie uns aufgegriffen und verh rt anschlie end wurden wir mit dem zug zur ckgeschickt am liebsten h tten sie mich eingesperrt aber sie konnten mir nichts nachweisen und mussten mich gehen lassen meine akte hatten sie schon durchgeschaut ob sie mir etwas anh ngen konnten aber was in china geschieht ist nochmal schlimmer
1150561 davon habe ich schon geh rt aber das ausma war mir nicht bewusst
1150562 wenn ich das hier so h re dann schaue ich mir sicher nicht die olympischen spiele an die sportler sollten am besten auch nicht mitmachen
1150563 es wundert mich nicht dass das ioc jetzt schweigt sie interessieren sich vermutlich mehr f r das geld das jetzt hereinkommt sollten aber eigentlich jetzt st rker gegen china vorgehen
1150564 ich bin schockiert ich sehe das hier zum ersten mal verbrechen wie folter arbeitslager und organraub sind gegen die menschliche natur solche dinge geh ren in keine gemeinschaft wenn ich mir diese menschenrechtsverletzungen hier vor augen halte werde ich mir dir olympischen spiele garantiert nicht anschauen
1150565 nein aber ich glaube dass es so etwas in china gibt
1150566 schrecklich alle teilnehmer der wettk mpfe m ssten von den spielen zur cktreten aber da steckt nat rlich jahrelange harte arbeit dahinter
1150567 ja dann kann man sie nicht gucken ich bin auch in einem kommunistischen land gro geworden ich wei dass es ganz schwierig ist sich gegen das regime zu wehren die kinder und jungen menschen werden schon von klein auf ver ngstigt das kann man nur durchbrechen wenn die jungen menschen ins ausland reisen damit sie diese angst verlieren ich glaube damit k nnte man gute ergebnisse erreichen ich habe 22 jahre in ungarn gelebt und habe selbst nicht so viel von dem druck mitbekommen aber mein vater hatte angst

1150574 el discurso t pico del mojigato del hip crita del fariseo del escribano mediante el cual afirman que los programas est n blindados contra el uso electorero cuando no es cierto
1150575 eso no es nuevo lo hicieron en el 2006 lo est n haciendo ahora en entidades como guanajuato quer taro e hidalgo donde la gente que va y pide un servicio de determinado programa social le preguntan en qu partido est y si encuentra inscrito en el revolucionario institucional no lo atienden

1150608 navevo has identified an industry challenge and addressed it with a unique product
1150609 we are delighted that pronav has been recognised as an important innovation for the fleet and telematics industry
1150610 navevo is committed to providing unique navigation solutions and we feel that pronav addresses some of the fundamental issues experienced when using standard navigation within the commercial vehicle market
1150611 highly accurate mapping is a challenge to all gis users
1150612 were excited to be able to complement and extend the capabilities of arcgis to address those needs theres no better venue than the esri international user conference to show our users what weve been up to were very excited to demonstrate how blue marbles solutions will complement the esri software suite

1150617 the decision was based on extensive geospatial information and mapping that showed a long term threat to the polar bears sea ice habitat
1150618 satellite imagery helped make the case for the listing and helped me explain my decision to the american people
1150619 until recently our agencies have largely worked in isolation from each other
1150620 geomapping every conceivable service so we could measure outcomes and performance every day every week every month
1150621 the maps know where our problems are and where our opportunities are so we deploy our resources to where we can make the greatest progress for all
1150622 esri has enjoyed many years of successful collaboration with tec
1150623 we look forward to working with tec to design these pioneering prototypes that will support a new generation of defense geospatial capability
1150624 tecs ability to provide the warfighter with a superior knowledge of todays complex and ever changing operational environment depends in part on a productive marriage of our geospatial tools talent and military geospatial business logic with complementary commercial geospatial information technology
1150625 our partnership with esri allows us access to powerful software database systems and architectural concepts critical to our continued success as an army geospatial knowledge center
1150626 traditionally considered a backdrop to gis imagery is now being used by professionals in a variety of industries to acquire geospatial information essential for critical decision making
1150627 the integration of envi and arcgis now allows users to take advantage of envis high performance image processing capabilities as a part of their gis workflows providing them with even richer geographic information
1150628 working with a proven leader like itt visual information solutions is an excellent solution to extend our users imagery capability
1150629 itts ability to take advantage of esris already interoperable platform to provide gis users with its powerful image processing tools will greatly enhance users experience in working with imagery in a gis context the collaboration between itt vis and esri to bring this capability to users across a wide variety of industries and disciplines is an excellent example of geography in action

1150631 i drove by murano restaurant on saturday and there was brown paper covering all the windows when i called the message said they would be closed until september for remodeling and repairs there seems to be a lot of that going around

1150633 we received the call of a man down in the front yard it took us only about a minute to arrive but there was already a crowd of concerned citizens around the patient i saw someone performing cpr and recognized him as a young man i knew from coaching wrestling years before although he knew what to do and was doing a good job oxygenating the blood he looked at me and i could see the terror and fear in his eyes

1150711 there are two parts to making certain that medicare dollars go to their intended purposes

1150780 i will always respect what happened in the past and i will always ask for advice im fresh into this and i will need some help one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from senior members in the squad who have said they are right behind me
1150781 i havent even thought that far ahead my concern this week is about how we can salvage pride from this series
1150782 hopefully i am going to bat exactly the same way the way colly paul collingwood and i played is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and against australia you have to be positive and aggressive

1150820 during his time in chicago as an assistant coach mark did a great job working with their young players and their young defensemen in particular and he was instrumental in helping that club make the great strides it has made the last couple of years
1150821 mark was an important player for the kings and i feel that his all round experience in this game as a coach and as a player will really assist me as we work together with our players
1150822 2008 nhl draft live from the los angeles kings draft party updated
1150823 if you have balls you have to be like this
1150824 los angeles kings and the 2008 nhl draft defining moments
1150825 i was here in la when i got the call i live here during the summer i was pretty excited to stay here and join the kings its a great organzation and a great ownership group a classy ownership group
1150826 its good to have that comfort zone coming in knowing the area knowing the practice rink
1150827 its a pretty short drive to the practice rink which is nice it just eases my way into it that much more its good to have that
1150828 i was excited shocked i felt a lot of different things
1150829 you hear your name in trade talks for quite some time and you cant prepare yourself until it really happens i tried to but once i got the call it was a little shocking but exciting at the same time
1150830 the first half of the season i struggled to find my focus and to get my game back a couple of years ago i had my best season but i struggled up to the halfway point last season i felt my game got better as the season went on and i got over that thats behind me now
1150831 you want to bounce back from an off year and im working hard to do that
1150832 im always going to work hard in the off season to get ready for training camp and the grind of the season im fully confident that ill turn things around and have a great year
1150833 i play on the penalty kill and power play i usually play the point on the power play in edomonton but im not sure ill do that here i take a lot of pride in my face off ability and i just try and play every position and solid at both ends of the rink
1150834 im jacked about being here and excited to get going
1150835 thats about it im just excited about a new beginning
1150836 although it is tough to see good players and good people move on we feel weve made a step towards improving our overall offense
1150837 lubomir is a world class defensemen who has been one of the premier offensive defensemen over the past five years
1150838 its never easy to give up a player of lubos caliber but for the direction of this franchise this exchange allows us to add two players who fit the long term vision for this team
1150839 we appreciate lubos service and outstanding play these last seven years in los angeles
1150840 he was not only a great player for us but a class act
1150841 the young players that are in the draft and as we see more prevalent coming through the system this is one of the advantages of going out on the road meeting kids myself meeting parents i think the ability to communicate and build trust with young players is critical because the fear factor with young people is not there anymore as it was in the past
1150842 so the question is is it change your ways or is it adapt to the people were dealing with i think weve all had to do that even assistant general manager ron hextall says its very different from when he came up through the ranks when dealing with players the impact the agents now have these kids have agents at 14 years old they learn in junior hockey now that if you dont like going somewhere you can manipulate the team you want to play for
1150843 if youre only going to evaluate it on the past the season ends disappointingly sure
1150844 we werent as good as we thought i think we shouldve been better but is that enough to make a change i didnt really think so particularly with a coach who had a good track record with other organizations but then you look again just like a player where does he fit into your overall plan
1150845 were talking about a guy with a lot of wins
1150846 but this is different from colorado or vancouver this is not an easy team to coach when you have to go out and get bridge free agents to bide time for your young players and build something through the draft and through your system
1150847 you have to be realistic in terms of your expectations because youre not able to build the camaraderie i go back to free agency back on july 4 six or seven guys not the way to go and thats a harder team to coach i dont think marc ever confronted that type of building scenario even though he had a wealth of experience when youre in that situation the bridge towards the build i dont think he had to face that yet
1150848 theres no doubt were committed to the way were going after my meeting with ownership this week
1150849 its more evident than ever that theyre committed to building a young core for the lack of a better term the old fashioned way
1150850 ultimately it comes down to a meeting with ownership and their commitment to staying with this plan because in the end their philosophy is what dictates the plan and theyre not changing the course in terms of building a young core the old fashioned way
1150851 its safe to say that we might be accelerating it so theres more of a commitment than ever to doing it this way
1150852 the only thing i wanted to hear from ownership was a commitment to stay with the idea of building with young players
1150853 that was it seeing where some of these young players might be in terms of using them there is a school of thought that says that in a perfect world you completely back off instead of trying to play a 21 year old or a 19 year old and use your minor league time to its fullest thats not totally irrational but its also not practical at times
1150854 when i put all these plans together the only thing i want to hear from ownership is are you still committed to building through the draft and with young players if anything theyre stronger on that now than they were when i got here the challenge now is to not only get the young players but to keep them because of the way the money is going
1150855 the thing you see from organizations time and time again when it gets a little hard its easy to switch course
1150856 when youre in these situations ownership has a right to say this is not what we expected or we have to make an adjustment here
1150857 all i heard was no you continue on this route to put together a core thats going to make us a contender
1150858 they said to stay with this and if anything go even harder at it
1150859 we have the illusion of being young because our better players are young
1150860 but in terms of our overall make up particularly on the back end theres a transition that has to take place where we in fact become a young team
1150861 weve had time since the playoffs ended in manchester to evaluate where those kids are in terms of being in our lineup
1150862 you look at the draft picks that are out there i spent a lot of time in toronto and down the stretch trying to gauge whether one or two of these players could be ready for the nhl
1150863 we havent had time to look at candidates at this stage
1150864 for the most part well start our search after today and look for what you hope will be the right fit as you project your roster thats the hard part that started to become clearer to us in the last month or so the direction we were going with the timing of the youth so to speak
1150865 this is a critical hire well get through development camp in july and hopefully make the right gut call in the end were going to take our time go through the process and hopefully get the right guy
1150866 i havent had a chance to meet with them yet i want to talk to mike johnston about the possibility of being considered for this role
1150867 i think right now weve committed to considering mike johnston
1150868 i think hes pretty well respected in the industry and i think thats where were leaning right now but that doesnt mean we wont open it up
1150869 guys that have options they have to decide which challenge they want
1150870 its not only a guy who fits with where your team is and where you want to go but that candidate has a different landscape for every organization
1150871 if you go to san jose or ottawa for instance theres no question those teams should be cup contenders
1150872 everythings been built the infrastructure is in place now go ahead ride everything to the top or do you want to get on the ground floor build with young players help establish a culture and maybe go through the hard times but have the satisfaction of starting something from the ground up
1150873 the hockey people are starting to look and say hmm there might be something pretty good there if they can get the back end established and keep the youth up front that could be a good place to go and grow with
1150874 thats important because every team brings its own challenge and that individual has to want that challenge or you dont want him
1150875 they put me through some tests they wanted me to become as fit as i could to show that i was committed and i did that
1150876 they just wanted me to realize that they wanted to become winners and i think im a winner and im going to help them do that
1150877 they really wanted me to know that their pick at number two was very important to them that they were going to build their franchise around me so i really had to work as hard as i could
1150878 i knew how important it was and how much theyre putting on me to become a very good player in their organization
1150879 i love the game of hockey and ill do anything to become the best player i can be
1150880 one setback was my fitness and ive worked really hard at that im going to continue to become more and more fit and work on a lot of things on the ice i think i can do that now that ive lost the weight i feel so much quicker a lot more mobile every aspect of my skating feels a lot faster and better
1150881 i really was dreaming of this since i was a little kid right before i kind of had the gut feeling i was going to go but then i saw calgarys gm and lombardi shaking hands and i thought oh no i didnt think i was going to go there so i was a little worried
1150882 i wouldve been glad to go anywhere but just because i loved la so much when i was a little kid its just unbelievable to be here
1150883 wayne gretzky was my idol growing up not only was he my favorite player on the ice but i thought off ice he also dealt with the media very well so i just loved him growing up i just loved wayne gretzky when i was a kid and thats what made me follow the kings
1150884 i think everybody back there has a pretty good handle of what type of player he is and how special he could become but the rub was when people looked at comparisons between doughty and bogosian was zachs toughness and competitiveness i think we got that in teubert if you could put them all together it would be great i think that element was really lacking in our group
1150885 i still believe strongly in what this type of kid brings with his leadership his toughness his commitment
1150886 he has some work to do theres no doubt about it but he has a presence about him if all goes well that could be a special group back there i just think thats critical if youre ever going to win something that matters
1150887 thats why when we did the deal we had to get up into a certain area
1150888 we werent just going to trade cammalleri unless we were sure we could get this guy we set a target from eleven to thirteen this is where we had to be to ensure ourselves that we were getting him i was dealing with three or four teams i was offered some good players who couldve helped us now but they didnt fit within what were trying to do in terms of the core were trying to put together
1150889 cammalleri was a good player but it was clear that he was probably a one year asset for us going forward
1150890 it was very clear that ownership wants to get a young nucleus together that can stay together and our chances of keeping cammalleri in that nucleus didnt look very good on the heels of last years salary demands
1150891 our chances of moving him and maximizing value werent looking very good
1150892 we went through the entire market this week and prior to it and i got a pretty good handle on what the league thought of him in terms of my ability to get a return
1150893 what was clear to me was i couldnt get into where i needed to not only that teubert was the guy we really wanted there were some pretty good players in that layer but to give up cammalleri we thought we had to be in that layer hopefully with teubert being there
1150894 it was clear to me that i couldnt get in there by trading him outright
1150895 those teams thought that was too high once it was clear to me that i couldnt get in there then i tried to start working on sprucing it up so to speak by using the 28th overall pick or our second round picks in combinations when that didnt work i tried to find another partner and that was calgary
1150896 i told flames general manager darryl sutter last night that i was fine on our part that he was going to give me the 17th overall pick for cammalleri the second round pick flopping was ok with me because i want to move some picks into next year anyway but like i told him 17 is not enough for me to get what i want
1150897 i didnt feel teubert would be there i was thinking hed be gone in that 13 15 range
1150898 i had to go to all those teams picking 11 14 and say ok would you take 17 and 32
1150899 we paid a big price with the 28th overall pick but i was prepared to pay it to get a player with these elements
1150900 there was a chance that i couldve traded that pick and moved down two if i wanted to get cute thinking that teubert would fall a couple of spots it was an opportunity to move back maybe two or three spots and take a chance that my guy would be there but i wasnt too enamored with doing that but it was a thought
1150901 when buffalo called i told them i wont trade with the other team if you tell me who youre taking as long as youre not taking my guy
1150902 i dont have to take the risk you dont have to take the risk that somebody else is going to slide move into that slot so we go off to the side and im going to write down the guy im taking and you write down who youre taking if we dont match then its a third round pick in 2009 if we do nobodys at a loss for wares
1150903 i think obviously on the front end it again trended towards defensemen
1150904 i think were pretty happy with the guys we got
1150905 particularly with defenseman andrew campbell selected in the third round 74th overall after a trade with buffalo and voinov we add two more kids who are good prospects to our system
1150906 as i said yesterday the defense part of our reserve list has become stronger the key right now is to develop them as men and develop them as players if we dont do that this is not going to be a great day
1150907 i think weve taken a huge jump when you match us up now
1150908 if you look at nashvilles back end so much of what theyre building there with suter hamhuis weber they added blum last year there are some similarities where their emphasis is there and the strength of that reserve list
1150909 i just think weve taken a huge step with those four guys jack johnson thomas hickey and now doughty and teubert and dont forget that kid alec martinez
1150910 this kids going to challenge for a job too and weve got a couple of other kids in the minors and theyre not going to give up either weve got a lot to look forward to and get some players out of there
1150911 i think we finally got something we really liked and were pretty happy back here
1150912 i got pressure put on me by my owner who said i want the best kings draft in history lombardi explained
1150913 so i went back and looked at the history and i think the best draft was larry murphy bernie nicholls daryl evans and jim fox that was the pressure put on to try and beat that
1150914 unfortunately the kings traded larry murphy a year later so that didnt work out
1150915 so thats a little internal pressure which is good it was a challenge to this staff i guess we wont know until down the road
1150916 the fact of the matter is i dont know what draft isnt important
1150917 if you look at any draft theres three ways to build a team the draft free agency and trades you cant make trades unless you draft well no general manager is stupid youve got to have things to trade so unless you draft well you dont have the cards to play so to speak to trade
1150918 its a great step for the organization but we still have a lot of work to do
1150919 se ha visto con resultados adversos y ha sabido sacar la personalidad como lo demostr el s bado frente al atlas

1150940 okay god what is it that you are teaching me
1150941 do you wish to be great then begin by being do you desire to construct a vast and lofty fabric think first about the foundations of humility the higher your structure is to be the deeper must be its foundation
1150942 loyalty means nothing unless it has at its heart the absolute principle of self sacrifice
1150943 it takes a noble man to plant a seed for a tree that will some day give shade to people he may never meet
1150944 we do not believe in ourselves until someone reveals that deep inside us something is valuable worth listening to worthy of our trust sacred to our touch once we believe in ourselves we can risk curiosity wonder spontaneous delight or any experience
1150945 the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched they must be felt with the heart
1150946 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
1150947 loyalty and devotion lead to bravery bravery leads to the spirit of self sacrifice the spirit of self sacrifice creates trust in the power of love
1150948 true strength lies in submission which permits one to dedicate his life through devotion to something beyond himself
1150949 every person in this life has something to teach me and as soon as i accept that i open myself to truly listening
1150950 never be afraid to try something new remember an amateur built the ark professionals built the titanic
1150951 dont ask yourself what the world needs ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that because what the world needs is people who have come alive
1150952 pure love is a willingness to give without a thought of receiving anything in return
1150953 it may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential but once youve flown past the summit of your fears nothing will seem impossible
1150954 i believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats i dont intend to waste any of mine
1150955 you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face
1150956 i have lived through this horror i can take the next thing that comes along
1150957 be who you are and say what you feel because in the end those who matter dont mind and those who mind dont matter
1150958 your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart
1150959 accept the things to which fate binds you and love the people with whom fate brings you together but do so with all your heart
1150960 the greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do
1150961 many people will walk in and out of your life but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart
1150962 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter
1150963 our real blessings often appear to us in the shape of pains losses and disappointments but let us have patience and we soon shall see them in their proper figures
1150964 hatred paralyzes life love releases it hatred confuses life love harmonizes it hatred darkens life love illumines it
1150965 nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold
1150966 i was always looking outside myself for strength and confidence but it comes from within it is there all the time
1150967 the greatest virtues are those which are most useful to other persons
1150968 you measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals
1150969 a blessed thing it is for any man or woman to have a friend one human soul whom we can trust utterly who knows the best and worst of us and who loves us in spite of all our faults
1150970 a hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank account was the sort of house i lived in or the kind of car i drove but the world may be different because i was important in the life of a child
1150971 to be capable of steady friendship or lasting love are the two greatest proofs not only of goodness of heart but of strength of mind
1150972 you never lose by loving you always lose by holding back
1150973 you have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was
1150974 for one human being to love another that is perhaps the most difficult of our tasks the ultimate the last test and proof the work for which all other work is but preparation
1150975 trust yourself you know more than you think you do
1150976 the strength of a mans virtue must not be measured by his efforts but by his ordinary life
1150977 i have an issue i would like to speak to you about
1150978 la nica forma de clasificar es jugar bien y hacer goles
1150979 para m y para todos los jugadores ser a algo hermoso ganar el torneo de los juegos vinimos a ganar la medalla de oro vamos a ir despacito y ojal lo podamos conseguir
1150980 esperemos que esta situaci n no se repita m s sergio batista seleccionador argentino me entendi y mis compa eros tambi n ellos no tuvieron ning n problema en esperarme
1150981 the big social networking sites just arent safe for young girls

1151033 authorities are trying to promote bilingual education in tajik and russian languages
1151034 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their
1151035 today weve published guidance which will help pcts deliver this program and help to make sure parents get the information they need about their childs results in ways that they have said will be most helpful
1151036 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1151037 schools are well placed to make a real difference in tackling obesity with record investment in sport and exercise encouraging active travel to and from home making cooking compulsory in secondary schools scrapping junk food and transforming the quality of school lunches
1151038 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so its only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives

1151044 the player in question hadnt played a game up until saturday and in fact has only been training for ten days so he is a bit behind everyone else
1151045 ive been trying to play as well as i can and now im just waiting
1151046 the hibs game would be my first chance to play in a competitive game here
1151047 my job is to give alan and the management a problem
1151048 i was signed a year ago but i only played seven matches all for the reserves
1151049 this season has already been better because i have played four times for the first team even if they have only been friendlies and i have done well
1151050 ive spoken to celtic about jim obrien and i await their answer to my proposal
1151051 i think if he signs were going to have to work very hard with jim and hes going to have to work very hard with us
1151052 as everyone knows he has spent a fair part of the pre season with us and he appears to be technically a very good player
1151053 he always looks to be comfortable while in possession of the ball and he has good energy levels as he gets up and down the park well
1151054 he is a naturally left sided player who is more than decent in the air so im sure he will be a good addition to the squad
1151055 we have no real update on the status of the injuries with craig and andy but we should have a clearer picture by tomorrow
1151056 i would say that they dont look too serious my one wee worry is that they were both non contact injuries
1151057 it is nice to be still playing in the spl but im not getting any younger
1151058 its something to look forward to its another season and its only a week away and were all desperate to get going again
1151059 ive done it for that many years that i still have got full confidence in my own ability to still be playing at this level
1151060 so hopefully i can do it and get a few goals in the league and hopefully we can finish higher than we did last year
1151061 i would rather score tap ins than ones like that
1151062 it was obviously nice to get that accolade but that was years ago now and hopefully there is a lot more goals to be scored this year for st mirren
1151063 we are trying our best to sign players at the moment chief executive peter lawwell is active at the moment working very hard
1151064 from the players point of view im hopeful the squad can be added to before the start of the season
1151065 he only needed half chances to score two against dunfermline the other week and again here hes been deadly in front of goal
1151066 hes really settled in with the rest of the lads
1151067 its great to have guys you can pick out and who can turn even half chances into goals
1151068 francisco can definitely do that hes looked a top drawer player so far and also jon daley and warren feeney have shown they can put the ball in the net
1151069 theres a strength in depth across the whole team weve got 22 people in the squad who all think they should be playing every week
1151070 one of the reasons i was so keen to come back is because i can see the potential of this team
1151071 we are still trying to speak to stoke city about getting adam rooney on loan for a year
1151072 i am trying to bring him in for the opening game of the season against aberdeen
1151073 i have always said if i need money i am sure the board will back me but there is no progress on calum elliot
1151074 it looks like we will go into the aberdeen match with the squad already here but i am trying to sort out the rooney situation
1151075 andy barrowman scored again had one chalked off for offside and rattled the post from 20 yards
1151076 his all round performance really impressed me and he has done well throughout the pre season
1151077 burnley were excellent in the first half and we were excellent in the second half
1151078 there has been a vast improvement with his calf but it looks as though the game has come too quickly for him
1151079 its a big test for us early in the season and its a game that we need to get a result in if we want to play european football its as simple as that
1151080 the pressure is not a problem we showed last season that we can handle the pressure when it comes to getting results
1151081 i dont know how much i have in my account
1151082 at the moment we have christian nade jamie mole juho makela and gary glen up front and we must give them confidence
1151083 i must look at whats best for the team at the moment i cant wait for new names we play on saturday so am i supposed to wait and wait and then play with ten men
1151084 girls 6 are forced to walk on hands for 3 minutes
1151085 guy who knew a guy who met a guy in a bar that knows a guy that knows brett favres third cousin twice removed
1151086 man i wish brett would have come back for one more year
1151087 brett doesnt care about money he just wants to play
1151088 if favre gives them the best chance to win this year he should be their starting quarterback
1151089 i need to go home to mississippi to decide whether i want to play or not next year ill let you know in march

1151138 it is of course impossible to convey by words the clear conceptions that are gained by direct vision of the objects of study and the accompanying diagram
1151139 the method of examination employed was that of clairvoyance there were only two observers mr leadbeater and myself and it is very desirable that our results should be tested by others who can use the same extension of physical sight the researches being carried on upon the physical plane the forms examined being gaseous and etheric only a very slight intensification of ordinary vision is all that is necessary and many should therefore be able to test our observations they cannot be regarded as established by the outside world until others have corroborated them and we put them forward in the hope of stimulating work along this line and of thus bringing to science when its instruments fail it the old old instrument of enlarged human vision

1151234 it will be one of the hardest courses of all time
1151235 when i interviewed for the job i said ive been waiting for this call my whole life
1151236 the changes my father made at oakland hills which was the first course strengthened after world war ii catapulted his career
1151237 its a real honor for my family to bring oakland hills into the 21st century
1151238 there are a couple of tee shots because of quite undulated fairways that you have to make a decision where youre going to hit it off the tee
1151239 but really with the greens being so severe if you get a good picture in your mind of what the greens are like you can leave your shots into the greens in good position
1151240 weve made the finish significantly more challenging so that anything can happen on those three holes
1151241 but what makes oakland hills special is the ebb and flow of holes that players should birdie to ones that par is a challenge to swing holes that could go either way
1151242 the only greens that compare are at augusta and congressional
1151243 its hard to stand out against those thats some pretty good competition but it doesnt make it any less
1151244 its a major and its one id love to win
1151245 its always gotten a bad rap but i still perceive it as one thats very important being the fourth one maybe guys build up a tolerance of the pressure and everything but again its a major a lot of guys get their first major win there so it provides a lot of hope for a lot of players
1151246 ive got a newfound energy for the end of the season
1151247 we were looking for something that said this is the seasons final major and your last shot at glory
1151248 when you win a tournament on the tour you go into the record books when you win a major you go into the history books
1151249 were we on the cutting edge of getting beaten up
1151250 yeah for sure but my philosophy is that every individual whether in the audience or on the stage or with a pen in hand about to write a review should think for himself and have his own opinion the subject kind of ends there
1151251 every time weve seen each other over the years weve talked about getting together again
1151252 but the busy ness of everyones schedule has come first until this confluence being on this 57 concert tour together has made us realize that we really missed being with each other we trade stories and recollections all the time its been a blast and musically by the time we get to boston near the end of the tour the band will be very very well oiled
1151253 but were improvisational musicians were always finding new ways to do things
1151254 my aunts and uncles my first and second cousins and their children my old chelsea high school friends boston is always great to come back to
1151255 i remember return to forever playing on a bill with weather report in this large green outdoor place it might have been the boston common im not sure and the police came up on stage and tapped me on the shoulder they told me i had to stop playing because we were violating noise level laws we had to stop the concert the audience didnt like it at all they were irate you definitely remember funny things like that
1151256 we were eating gouda pizza and we were just sitting and talking about life and talking about his kids and what is relevant to us in our lives and whats important to us and what we watch and what we would like to watch
1151257 and just the fact that people can click on the internet and get anything they want
1151258 joss said basically you are what anyone wants you to be and i know that in your own life thats what youre dealing with
1151259 this is a personality playground for me it is the ultimate role because i get to put on a different skin each day
1151260 i realized what i had when it was gone and that was a very important lesson for me to learn in my career its very very hard to be under the control of a show creator or a studio that wants your character to do something that you just dont feel comfortable doing or you dont understand why theyre doing it and maybe theyre conforming to mainstream or all the cooks in the kitchen at the studio with joss the executives have such respect for him that he really has that creative freedom to make the good stuff
1151261 wow the house is so quiet and peaceful with only nine children

1151265 i dont know i was going outside and felt him hop out of my hands

1151270 we are not sure where the implement came from but certainly its a concern when anyone arms themselves with a weapon and uses it to inflict damage
1151271 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1151272 were still waiting on the doctors to give us the timetable on when were going to have this procedure done
1151273 i will not put myself into a position where i have to defend myself to state my side of the story theres no side
1151274 theres only one side a lack of judgment on my part
1151275 i have no excuse all i have is the opportunity to gain the respect of my fans to gain the respect of my family gain the respect of my co workers and gain the respect of the organization
1151276 im a fallen man im a man that made a mistake
1151277 i plan to mend the bridges that ive burned and help rebuild the bridge if i need to all by myself
1151278 the good thing is that we were both man enough to come face to face and talk without any other kind of altercations
1151279 were bigger than that sometimes when emotions are involved you do stupid things for me being a christian i have a forgiving heart and im willing to move forward to help this team win this year
1151280 weve got to get him ready for the season and we have to get other people ready for the season also
1151281 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1151282 i was having breakfast at about 8am when i heard two or three loud bangs they sounded like a car backfiring so i didnt pay much attention until later when i heard some police had been killed
1151283 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1151284 theres an independence movement but i dont expect it to succeed and dont expect many people will want to take part because they expect it to fail and know the result will be more repression
1151285 etss problem masks a more endemic massive failure of sats that runs right through the system this is vanity testing so government can feel good about whats happening in primaries and show results are improving but its expensive for primaries not trusted by secondaries and damaging for children
1151286 there is an issue wider than the problems with ets school test results are not a reliable indicator of pupil performance
1151287 we are considering a boycott but some naht members think that wouldnt be a professional response despite the strength of feeling against sats
1151288 i have sympathy with that view but if you got to the point where there is a head of steam throughout the education community against sats and the response from the government is that there will be absolutely no negotiations then eventually you come to a situation where only a very strong campaign will have an effect
1151289 tests have changed several times over the period theyve been around trying to assess standards across the system over time using these tests is of relatively little value if you want to know how a system is performing you only need to test a sample not every 11 and 14 year old in the country
1151290 it is a tragedy that hundreds of thousands will join the millions who have left primary school unable to master the basics in the 3rs basics that are the keystone of future opportunity and success
1151291 standards in our schools are rising and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test
1151292 we are already trialling changes to testing which allow teachers to choose when their pupils take new single level tests
1151293 we should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet
1151294 we think the bulk of the effort in the coming months is going to come from the divestment of non core assets
1151295 we have identified the list we have appointed investment bankers
1151296 most of the commercial activities were still able to grow underlying revenue but we observe that the environment is becoming more difficult on different fronts
1151297 given that we believe the double digit declines in advertising are now priced in that the risks surrounding pension funding have been mitigated and management is aggressively tackling costs we believe that there is little near term downside in the stock
1151298 while further cost cuts are now likely the near term investment case is driven by potential for takeover as opposed to fundamentals which appear to be declining
1151299 unnecessary printing of emails multiple copies single sided printing and the sending of massive documents to the printer which are unlikely to be read are just some of the regular scenarios lived out by businesses every day
1151300 most offices will find they can reduce waste costs by around 20 through simple no or low cost actions measures such as double sided or multiple page printing and recycling instead of paying for disposal can really help
1151301 4 is an average but weve found some manufacturing companies can save as much as 10 of their turnover
1151302 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1151303 a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and all parties are fully supportive
1151304 us respect for international law might be further damaged by this execution
1151305 the failure on the part of the us could have very serious implications for our relationship with mexico as well as other nations
1151306 he has indicated that he will go with their recommendation if they recommend a stay
1151307 even if he is executed there are still 50 other individuals whose cases are at issue
1151308 i think that is a fair characterisation rather than a slur
1151309 if you buy the ftse you are not buying the uk economy
1151310 it is a truism that emerging markets hold up until they dont
1151311 they are largely about momentum and as long as they are going up they are doing well but when they fall they fall the furthest
1151312 the ones that became hot spots then collapsed vietnam doubled and halved shanghai tripled and then halved again the stockmarkets that didnt attract large amounts of foreign investors in the past werent subject to the same excess or capital flight
1151313 our view is that oil prices are likely to fall and they could be in for a rocky ride
1151314 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1151315 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1151316 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1151317 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1151318 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1151319 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1151320 we believe he is innocent we believe hes being treated unfairly hes not above the law but hands off our president
1151321 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1151322 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1151323 we have to get the balance right between being a nanny state and a neglectful state
1151324 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have not banned it but we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behaviour
1151325 i find this particular line from the government to be tiptoeing through the daffodils
1151326 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1151327 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1151328 school nurses can make a real difference in helping children develop healthy habits but the government has failed to address the chronic shortage of school nurses
1151329 if ministers are serious about their plans to tackle child obesity then they should use this opportunity to really highlight the health risks it causes
1151330 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1151331 as good a shape as it could be to weather the storm
1151332 intentional constant and systematic attempts are being made to erode the achievements of the kemalist ataturk revolution turning religion into an ideology will politicise it and religion will then be the biggest loser
1151333 the military is the sole appointed guardian of the foundation of the turkish republic so they will be allergic to any kind of islamism
1151334 but after what we have just passed through he will be much more cautious than buyukanit
1151335 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made or the terms on which any such offer might be made
1151336 in our view a bid for imperial is readily affordable by either ongc or effectively the chinese government if sinopec has indeed entered the due diligence process late this ironically may give ongc more time to clear its bid it may also encourage other bidders to enter the fray such as knoc of south korea
1151337 crispin very early on saw weakness in financial services we saw the rise in food prices and were very pro agricultural commodities we also did well holding insurance companies
1151338 hypocritical and political there is a lot of noise around this things are being made up on the hoof to keep political masters happy
1151339 people want to find a scapegoat we were 0 28 short on bradford amp bingley stock that was a 1m position it is not our fault that bradford amp bingley was in trouble
1151340 investors should be starting to look further out and be expecting to make the real money some few years hence with the view that buying shares over the next nine months may feel painful but may turn out to have been not only courageous but brilliantly timed
1151341 the length and depth of that is uncertain i think if a recession occurred it could be shallow but any meaningful recovery in the housing market is unlikely before next year
1151342 we struggle to see any material uplift to group profitability before 2010 when the drag from us impairments could ease
1151343 hsbcs management insists that household can be salvaged by cutting costs and downsizing the business we disagree
1151344 confronted with the fact that madeleines dna was gathered from behind the sofa and from the boot of the vehicle and analysed by a british laboratory he said he could not explain why this would be
1151345 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1151346 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1151347 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1151348 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1151349 the search for madeleine goes on kate and gerry know there is a possibility that madeleine could be dead and could be long dead however there is absolutely no evidence that she is dead
1151350 mr owens resignation letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands
1151351 jim owen has made a significant contribution to the development of tnk bp and we regret to see him go
1151352 during two and a half years with the company jim has built a strong organisation underneath him and we expect to have a smooth transition as tnk bp considers candidates for the cfo job we wish jim all the best as he pursues new endeavours
1151353 almost certainly need to operate without fully knowing the factual background
1151354 far from being a system of check and balances this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1151355 this report is another nail in the coffin of a bill which is unnecessary and which undermines the liberty of every man and woman in the country
1151356 everything was going well to camp four at 7 800m and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1151357 that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1151358 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1151359 i would like everyone to be able to contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers i am suffering for it but its too beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
1151360 k2 is the peak to climb in the himalayas it is a pyramid of rock with very little snow and a lot of ice
1151361 it is not like everest where there are fixed ropes bottled oxygen and sherpas who set camps and carry loads which make it possible for less practiced climbers those who take on the challenge of k2 are the best they have the right people and the right idea they will turn back but it is the unknown and unpredictable factors that make it so dangerous
1151362 the passengers are prepared to remain on board for weeks or longer if their passage is impeded
1151363 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1151364 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1151365 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1151366 we are sending out requests to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1151367 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1151368 most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
1151369 the gas prices that are wiping out your pay cheques and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state
1151370 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1151371 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1151372 we should sell 70m barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1151373 explicitly believe in addressing a breach in one of societys central relationships between the top and bottom rich and poor
1151374 we have pledged to share the proceeds of growth so that government grows more slowly than the trend rate of the economy so government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp
1151375 financial markets will not and should not return to the status quo ante
1151376 its because we didnt over feast in the good times that we now have no famine in tougher times
1151377 you can see a definite pickup of impairments more of that will come through in the second half but it is difficult to know what impact that will have
1151378 after mughniyehs assassination the president apparently stripped shawkat of many of his powers
1151379 suleiman would have been involved in that process and it was known that shawkat hated suleiman
1151380 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hizbullah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel
1151381 the assassination means there is a power struggle going on in syria and it most probably concerns iran people like this dont just die unless something is going on
1151382 little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession
1151383 the construction sector looks to be in for an extended difficult time this reinforces our belief the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008
1151384 housing was again the sick man of the industry as levels of activity plunged to a record low
1151385 that said poor performance in the commercial and civil engineering sectors couldnt provide any cause for celebration
1151386 july marked an end to constructors optimism about recovery as spirits were knocked by the persistent and rapid decline in new business and activity more jobs were shed and at a faster pace than in june as pessimism about the sectors future took hold
1151387 where mostly straight men show up to shows in small packs high fiving during songs raising glasses at the band in a show of brotherly love and shouting i love you toward the stage
1151388 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis theres a lot of strong characters in the dressing room yesterday i sat down with peter and we had a really good discussion about how we want to take this team forward we need to unite we need to get on to the same hymnsheet we need to get this team going forward the crux of yesterdays meeting was to determine where peter and myself can take this team
1151389 im 100 confident we can have a good working relationship i wouldnt be sitting here today if i wasnt confident everything is going to be perfectly fine
1151390 to be totally honest the most exciting thing is that ive had text messages and phone calls from the senior players in the squad who basically said were right behind you we support you give it a shot
1151391 once youve got the support of the lads around you who are with you the whole time theres nothing more you can ask for i hope it wont restrict the way i play i play the way i play and ive been successful so far if it doesnt work and it affects a few things in terms of my personal life if it affects the way i bat and all that then i will be man enough to say so
1151392 i was disappointed i wasnt thought of as captain but once the selectors decided they wanted to unify the test and one day jobs it was a non starter for me
1151393 i definitely feel i could have made a decent fist of the test captaincy and would have benefited from the time i previously did the job but it was not to be and there is not much i can do about the selectors decision there is no point feeling sorry for myself what i have to do now is get behind kevin
1151394 it crossed my mind for a couple of minutes that i may get the job but i probably am too young
1151395 both of us were in pretty good shape for these matches but i had the mental belief that i could win and once you win against someone for the first time you have the feeling that you can do it again and again
1151396 i think it also gets into their heads if they beat you five or six times and you come back to win against them winning a masters series event is tough and it will be hard to follow that up but it gives you a lot of confidence knowing that you can do it
1151397 the first three times i played him djokovic i wasnt in such good physical shape he killed me in monte carlo but this time i was in good shape if you put the work in off the court then you can eliminate all the possible excuses and just go into the match not thinking about physical shape and how much practice you have put in
1151398 id rather be in the position im in now than going over there having been knocked out in the first round at cincinnati
1151399 now i feel absolutely fine both physically and mentally im not fatigued at all
1151400 it pops in at a difficult time in the tennis calendar right after two masters series events and right before the last grand slam of the year so its really tough and its a long way to travel as well so i think its going to be really difficult for tennis players i think anybody who does well at the olympics is unlikely to do well at the us open
1151401 yes it happened just like that no dribs or drabs chess is a jealous lover will tolerate no other
1151402 stop the print run and deem the book out of print
1151403 crispin very early on saw weakness in financial services we saw the rise in food prices and were very pro agricultural commodities we also did well holding insurance companies
1151404 hypocritical and political there is a lot of noise around this things are being made up on the hoof to keep political masters happy
1151405 people want to find a scapegoat we were 0 28 short on bradford amp bingley stock that was a 1m position it is not our fault that bradford amp bingley was in trouble

1151409 hsbcs management insists that household can be salvaged by cutting costs and downsizing the business we disagree
1151410 its much easier to learn how to contract undamaged muscles
1151411 schoolgirls should learn how to do pelvic floor exercises and do them on a daily basis
1151412 there is much more impact on womens pelvic floors than there used to be and women are more conscious of problems
1151413 about 50 of women will have some urinary leakage at some time after childbirth
1151414 seventy per cent of young girls who trampoline wet themselves
1151415 the pelvic floor is the main focus in pilates nearly every single exercise youre doing even if its one working your feet is engaging the pelvic floor to put it bluntly its just like trying to stop yourself from peeing you engage that part of your body as tightly as possible upwardly and inwardly the most important thing is not to hold your breath at the same time
1151416 there are many issues with incontinence as people get older both for men and women
1151417 c sections partially protect but not completely just being pregnant and having nine months of intra abdominal pressure is enough women who have not had children are less likely to have pelvic floor problems
1151418 if you are born with weak collagen the elastic tissue in your body you are more likely to be exposed to pelvic floor problems
1151419 there is a fine line between worrying women and looking at what they can actually do
1151420 there are so many health messages and there is enough that we would like people to be doing without worrying about their pelvic floor
1151421 because womens expectations of sexual intercourse have altered but if you talk to women in the older generation their expectation is that these things are normal and its just a natural part of getting older previously if someone had incontinence they would just buy pads and limit their activity
1151422 with mr rodgers again providing the copia and mr hammerstein providing the corn
1151423 say it loud and theres music playing say it soft and its almost like praying
1151424 i hope and i pray for hester to win just one more a
1151425 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
1151426 social kissing has been common in certain circles in britain since the 1920s but until fairly recently it was mostly confined to relatives or close friends and to what you might call the excitable professions the theatre the media fashion anywhere you might call someone darling basically its now infinitely more widespread even accountants do it
1151427 were now starting to see the advent of non sexual lip kissing
1151428 bank manager and customer boss and employee next door neighbours client and accountant any old colleague theyre all greeting each other with a little scuffle round the cheek and lip area the rule seems to be if youve met them even once you kiss them and in business circles certainly that very definitely wasnt the case even three years ago
1151429 we kiss people we used to hug hug people we used to shake hands with and shake hands with people we used to nod to
1151430 its like these days its not unusual to hear teenagers say to their parents i love you in my day if youd said that to your mum or dad theyd have assumed they were about to be given the last rites and were becoming much more tactile theres a whole revolution in that
1151431 its about fast track bonding and empathy it also allows you to smell the other person your nose is right by the pulse behind their ear you can sniff their perfume and have a fairly good guess at what they had for lunch its a far more intimate personal instant connection
1151432 when parents kiss their children it means one thing but when they kiss each other it means something entirely different people will greet a total stranger with a kiss on the cheek and then use an identical gesture to express their most intimate feelings to a lover
1151433 kisses can be given in private or in public by men to men men to women women to women adults to children or children to each other
1151434 they can be unilateral or reciprocated they can be on the lips the cheek or any other part of the body they can be blown in the air
1151435 giving a mutual kiss when they depart from each other a custom that i never saw before nor heard of nor read in any history
1151436 i grew up at a time when if even your mother kissed you you were expected to wipe your mouth on your sleeve for decades a good firm handshake was all that was expected now all of a sudden youre expected to embrace your female colleagues daily even perhaps hug the divisional director from manchester its all become incredibly awkward and embarrassing
1151437 i feel permanently uncomfortable these days most of my friends expect a kiss which is fine i suppose quite nice in fact but at what point do you decide whether a colleague or a regular business contact or client or even a friends partner is also a friend theres a real risk of getting it wrong of offending someone whatever you decide to do i get quite nervous
1151438 the british werent even very good at the handshake and now we find ourselves having to deal with air kisses cheek kisses hugs squeezes even lip kisses its not easy the basic rule i think should be that handshakes are fine with anyone and kisses should be reserved for people you have some kind of relationship with even if its only a business lunch at which youve talked about something other than just business
1151439 really go for broke and you have to give advance warning of your intentions make what we call announcement gestures start puckering early on and raise your hands from quite a distance never kiss anyone without a torso touch by the way then theres a good chance theyll be prepared for whats coming then its basically right cheek to right cheek left cheek to left cheek and put them down where you found them
1151440 its only really man to man where theres still some reticence
1151441 many men particularly younger generations will embrace quite comfortably these days but they still kind of feel the need to accompany it with some big soprano style slap on the back to show that even though they kiss theyre still men
1151442 if you kiss at one meeting and not at the next theyre going to get entirely the wrong message
1151443 take it on the chin when you get it wrong because believe me you will
1151444 es aqu donde empec el trabajo sobre vih con mi fundaci n
1151445 todos tenemos mucho por hacer en la lucha contra el sida que es como un gran drag n que afecta a todos a ricos y pobres y si lo que hacemos no funciona no da resultados tenemos que probar con algo nuevo
1151446 necesitamos abaratar a n m s los f rmacos de segunda l nea porque el tratamiento salva vidas y a cuanta m s gente lleguemos m s muertes evitaremos mi fundaci n hace lo posible por proporcionar la terapia a cada vez un mayor n mero de personas con vih y es necesario que stos sean accesibles

1151448 por lo que pueden ir por ah infectando a otras personas sin saberlo
1151449 el estigma y la discriminaci n que rodea a los enfermos de sida
1151450 quienes soportan adem s del sida una gran carga familiar
1151451 miles de ni os infectados con vih permanecen sin tratamiento lo que significa que est n sin una opci n que podr a salvarles
1151452 porque lo nico que quiere la gente con sida es vivir
1151453 mientras que la vivienda adecuada y segura ha sido reconocida como un derecho b sico humano mientras que la evidencia ha demostrado el v nculo entre pobreza y el riesgo a contraer el vih mientras que las condiciones pobres de vida incluyendo el hacinamiento limitan la privacidad la dignidad y hacen m s dif cil tener una conducta sexual irresponsable mientras se destinan muchos esfuerzos a la prevenci n y el tratamiento muchos seropositivos se ven obligados a vivir en la calle
1151454 youre asking me the question i spend the most time thinking about should i still be doing this im just going to do it until people stop listening its the thing i struggle with the most and i think its unfair
1151455 this is one of the species of greatest concern to our forests
1151456 com a ajuda de todas as autoridades envolvidas na quest o da seguran a hoje podemos ter a alegria e o orgulho de dizer que belo horizonte tem a melhor guarda municipal do brasil
1151457 could you fault the city of san francisco for wanting to create a healthier population
1151458 whatever we can do as a society to encourage healthy living benefits all of us
1151459 a scuff mark on his shoe i had never heard that one before
1151460 with whats going on with rolen maybe hell get some more playing time there
1151461 this is what i dreamed of as a child plain and simple you grow up wanting to be a major league baseball player the olympics is obviously the top athletes in the world an amazing venue its just kind of bad timing
1151462 theres a big buzz and everyone that ive talked to within the organization is really excited about the upcoming season
1151463 the way they finished last year its an exciting time to be an oiler my wife and i are really excited to be here
1151464 its an opportunity that were embracing and a change that were embracing i think that its gonna be great for my career and great for my family to have a little change of venue and come here to a great hockey city
1151465 as much as guys maybe say theyd like to stay in one place their whole career things dont always go your way or things kinda get stale a little bit
1151466 hes a hockey fanatic so hes gonna have lots of opportunity here to have some fun and get on the ice
1151467 my wife and i are both from upstate new york so were not immune to the cold weather we might be a little soft right now
1151468 whatevers gonna work best for the success of the team is how its all gonna play out
1151469 throughout the course of the season theres gonna be lots of ups and downs regardless of whos playing where and with who just because things may be set at the start of a season a lot of times thats not the way its going to stay throughout the course of a season its more important to just look at the top 9 and you get a sense of what kind of talent and capability there is
1151470 im looking to play a bigger leadership role on this team
1151471 you look at our roster and theres a lot of young guys i go from a team where i was middle of the road to maybe even one of the older guys and now im an old goat in the room
1151472 i try to play a physical game not just for myself but im trying to open up areas on the ice for my teammates
1151473 i think that with the right mixture in our forward lines that i can certainly help out and be productive
1151474 im not too worried about having to change my style because of somebody im playing against
1151475 i like being able to stare right across to the same guy every faceoff that im on the ice and just battle with him
1151476 i dont think anyone really understands just how hard it is to go to the stanley cup finals
1151477 when i was there in 02 i was a rookie and i played a lot of hockey that year then i came back the next year and was just a band aid everything hurts you dont realize how much youre going to hurt on a day to day basis so i think that would have a lot to do with the injuries that have occurred over the last couple seasons
1151478 were coming here with the intention that we wanna stay here and hopefully have a great year and the oilers organization is gonna want to keep me here
1151479 i dont think there have been any talks so far

1151548 for the first time ive seen iraqi security forces that can plan prepare and execute first class offensive operations
1151549 ive also seen a high level of trust and respect by the people of rashid for their own army and police forces
1151550 together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
1151551 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
1151552 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1151553 emplaced by special group criminals who operate as part of the illegal militias in baghdad
1151554 i think they want to undermine the government and theyre using the neighborhoods of rashid as a battlefield
1151555 there seemed to be a wedge that was placed between the people and the insurgents and we tried to exploit that
1151556 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminals and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district
1151557 we have captured more than 170 special group criminals associated with the jaysh al mahdi militia
1151558 seizing on the improved security conditions we are pursuing reconstruction projects to improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1151559 weve also proposed an additional 117 projects valued at more than 26 million
1151560 each project is coordinated with the rashid district council leadership to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the people

1151613 the gritty corrupt reality of the chinese economic miracle is the great business story of our time and alexandra harney has got it she has explored the factories dormitories and urban slums to reveal the devastating cost to the planet to american workers and to chinese citizens of the china price

1151648 the team analyzed y chromosomes from men in 13 populations in tanzania in eastern africa and in the namibia botswana angola border region of southern africa they discovered a novel mutation shared by some men in both locations which implied those men had a common ancestor further analysis showed the novel mutation arose in eastern africa about 10 000 years ago and was carried by migration to southern africa about 2 000 years ago the mutation was not found in bantu speakers suggesting that a different group nilotic language speakers first brought herds of animals to southern africa before the bantu migration this new genetic evidence correlates well with pottery rock art and animal remains that suggest pastoralists herders who migrated to new pasture with their flocks first tended sheep and cattle in southern africa around 2 000 years ago the genetic finding also helps explain linguistic similarities between peoples in the two regions

1151709 weve located a site that is optimal for the development of a new stadium building at the old arena site would be extremely problematic
1151710 this could cost us an additional year if not two years right now time is not our ally because the marlins lease at dolphin stadium expires in 2010 and the arena site does not present a viable alternative to us
1151711 it is our view that the careful negotiations for the stadium were the product of literally years of work among baseball dade county and the city of miami
1151712 we looked very hard at that arena site when we were looking at downtown sites more land would have to be acquired the general obligation bond of 50 million wouldnt be available so even if the costs were exactly the same wed be short 50 million
1151713 theres difficulty there with utility buildings and power lines that would have to be relocated theres a railroad line cutting through there that would also have to be relocated and finally the community is committed to developing little havana and the orange bowl site and we want to be part of that development
1151714 the marlins are an important part of the fabric of south florida
1151715 if the marlins continue on the current pace they will draw approximately 1 5 million fans this year more than the combined attendance of the dolphins and the heat this past year moreover the teams television ratings consistently rank in the top 10 of all baseball markets
1151716 how can one forget the over 500 000 fans that attended marlins home games during the playoffs and world series in 2003 an average of 65 000 fans per night i believe south florida loves the marlins and with the appropriate facility they will thrive over the long term
1151717 foregoing another year or more of the new stadium revenues plus the losses in the old stadium and increased construction costs of the new stadium are some things that are very troublesome and some things that are being carefully monitored
1151718 in the next place the state governments are by the very theory of the constitution essential constituent parts of the general government they can exist without the latter but the latter cannot exist without them

1151766 do you need to take it a few days before the irritability starts or would it be like taking an aspirin take it the same day when the symptoms first surface
1151767 this means that you can almost take an sri as needed for premenstrual dysphoria
1151768 you dont have to schedule two weeks every month you can wait until you experience your symptoms and start medication
1151769 there has certainly been a lot of critique about the way its taken something that is part of the normal hormonal changes involved in womens reproductive cycles and pathologizing them making them into a medical condition that needs drug treatment
1151770 its extra prescribing of an antidepressant for an inappropriate use to women of childbearing age
1151771 there are many different ways of experiencing menstruation and occasionally there might be an unusual set of symptoms but by and large i think its best to dispute the existence of a pms condition and certainly not prescribe an sri
1151772 these visits were likely accompanied by a drug recommendation in the form of a new prescription a drug sample being provided or a direction to the patient to continue taking a current medication

1151775 i think sometimes men are inclined to attribute to a womans cycling stuff that doesnt belong there
1151776 typically shell be sounding off about something thats wrong in the relationship or she wants him to do something more around the house and they can both say ah well its just that youre pms ing
1151777 and of course shes expressing it now during the premenstrual phase but shes feeling cross about it and wants it to change all the time the danger is if she only mentions it at a time when shes got premenstrual symptoms they can both dismiss it as not based in reality and not a valid complaint
1151778 we dump everything on a womans cycle anything that troubles a woman can be blamed on her being a reproductive animal
1151779 we found that the symptoms started to get better after four hours and we found significant results at bedtime the first day
1151780 and you dont have to plan this ahead it just starts when the symptom arises and stops when you dont have it anymore

1151983 the city is moving forward with several innovative and technological advances to their transit services and mvs unique expertise in this area will certainly complement those efforts
1151984 i have read and considered a number of reports from experts it is plain to me that if i were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition
1151985 sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty
1151986 you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives
1151987 not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long

1151993 this is not your fathers army okay maybe it is now
1151994 i always wanted to join the service i tried at 18 but because of family values and respect for my family i chose not to
1151995 i still knew that if someday it came around that i could do it
1151996 i was always hoping and praying somehow id make this goal this dream happen
1151997 i was called grandma and old lady most of the time i was there
1151998 i got a lot of encouragement from the younger soldiers to keep striving and to make it
1151999 he said you cant be coming here i said yes i am
1152000 you cant let that happen i cant have my mom here
1152001 i wanted to try and accomplish the rest of my goal which was to come to the service and to serve the soldiers i knew what the soldiers had to go through i saw my sons go through it and i wanted to be here to be of service to them she said
1152002 all the way through basic training they kept emphasizing that we were going to be deployed i was whole heartedly engaged with the fact that i was going to serve my country one way or the other whatever my country expected of me thats what i was going to do
1152003 i wasnt looking for anybody to be my significant other when i got to fort stewart
1152004 he came over to me in the foxhole and said what are you shooting at
1152005 he said from the first day he met me youre going to marry me he was telling everybody
1152006 ive enjoyed everything that ive done ive always felt that when soldiers accept me as working hard and getting them where they need to be helping them accomplish their mission that is my reward
1152007 he said that since he was retiring i would be retiring too
1152008 for anybody over 40 who really wants to come to the service there is a very big reward here
1152009 you have to come here open minded you cant come here as your own individual you have to be willing to change and you have to be willing to serve
1152010 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1152011 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1152012 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
1152013 i think is a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
1152014 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
1152015 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1152016 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1152017 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling

1152039 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1152040 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1152041 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1152042 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

1152115 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1152116 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1152117 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts that certainly is a golf course ive got a lot of good memories around
1152118 i havent seen it since i played it in 04
1152119 its just an incredibly tough golf course from what i remember it requires all the shots youve got to move the ball left to right right to left you need to hit it long you need to hit it straight you need to putt well these are just some of the most difficult greens ive ever seen so it takes absolutely everything

1152136 i had been struggling even to relate to my muslim friends
1152137 really gave me an idea that there are some good muslims even though there are also some bad muslims as much as there are some good christians and bad christians
1152138 i believe the quran teaches violence it doesnt teach peace it teaches violence
1152139 the god of the christian faith is not the god of islam

1152145 but im going to vote for the other partys presidential candidate
1152146 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making

1152165 i really hope the best for her because shes one of the sweetest girls ive ever met so i just hope it works out and it will because shes a good person and good things happen to good people

1152196 i then got in this feud with a german woman and eric defended me
1152197 you do not understand what this boy goes through every day
1152198 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when million of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1152199 jennifer garner gave the first speech supporting obama and she was very witty clever and funny she was followed by her husband ben then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change

1152214 the fact that sheen and petersen both happen to be on cbs is coincidental
1152215 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1152216 katie courics contract with cbs is legendary youd expect to see her there on the list

1152229 uh for a little while the doctor says he needs a lot of rest hes going to be fine
1152230 well im not sure whether you can help me with this
1152231 i can assure you mrs lightley that anything my father could do for you i can do even better
1152232 i see well then what do you know about navy newcomb do you know if anybody had been threatening him
1152233 oh i thought you needed legal advice im afraid i cant help you with this
1152234 well im sorry to have wasted your time cray i hope your father gets well soon
1152235 especially when he was just about to get all that money
1152236 yeah if hed only known it was just a few days away
1152237 but it so big i dont have any place to put it
1152238 now every time you look up youll see it and think of me
1152239 think of it as a love plant one of those white flowers is you and one of the pink ones is me
1152240 thatll work it can be loving and sexy but its dangerous too like me
1152241 i like danger and i know how to handle it
1152242 now that youre 61 i think you can handle a little late night caffeine
1152243 said ginger grinning as she cut large pieces and placed them on plates
1152244 have looked in the mirror and done a butt check lately
1152245 youre absolutely right barbs caboose is just fine its the saddlebags that are the problem
1152246 i cant keep up are we talking in terms of trains or horses
1152247 you do it every time just when im about to really go off on somebody usually jane you throw a monkey wrench into the thing i had a killer comeback to what jane said but now youve made me forget it
1152248 well you know ive been trying to help lacey out of the mess shes in
1152249 no surprisingly they havent and i dont know why they havent even charged her yet
1152250 but i doubt it the chief is not sharing information with me but if somebody had been charged he couldnt keep that a secret
1152251 im trying to come up with other possibilities for suspects and i think i have one maybe two
1152252 i went to visit ellegora newcomb this morning that didnt help much by the way navys funeral is tomorrow at ten yall want to go with me
1152253 but then i dropped by carl vittlemans office hes the newcombs attorney but he wasnt there instead i met with his son cray who i wasnt impressed with at all then on the way out i got his receptionist to spill the beans
1152254 from what she said it made me think there was a second trust fund you know that navy blew the first one all two million of it so im thinking there was a second one that he was unaware of and that he was due to get it on his twenty fifth birthday remember he got the first one when he turned 21
1152255 his dad had set up the trust fund before navy was born
1152256 so you think his father may have set up two trust funds
1152257 the second one being a backup in case he squandered the first one
1152258 except when he walked out in front of that bus and got himself run over
1152259 but how would it profit cray vittleman for navy to die
1152260 guess who i saw in the parking lot when i came out of his office
1152261 the two of them are having an affair and cray tells her about the secret trust fund so they plot to kill navy
1152262 but ginger i thought you said kayla was navys girlfriend not his wife
1152263 what if they really were married but they didnt want anybody to know
1152264 look navy never spent one second worrying about what other people thought
1152265 so why would he hide the fact that he was married it makes no sense
1152266 per chads direction as of 4 40 p m today july 3 do not ask the vendor to remove south carolina from the campaign

1152270 the retailers and their staff all have that information so they should be able to communicate that to the customer

1152275 they broke the glass panes of our office and our bank and threw away the chairs
1152276 in their haste they forgot to see balasahebs picture that adorned one of the glass panes
1152277 we respect balasaheb and that is why we kept his picture in our office in their desperation the sainiks forgot to see that
1152278 this all seems to be a desperate move on part of the bks to force our employees to join them they think that they can get away with anything
1152279 all employees came out of the terminal voluntarily to protest against the bks action there was no one to handle baggage or to put step ladders
1152280 the mob defied curfew and pelted stones disrupting valley bound trucks carrying essential supplies when police and crpf men tried to persuade them to disperse they went on a rampage

1152289 in addition to the above it is necessary to pass 5 or 4 o levels further to that it is also necessary to pass the common entrance test as prescribed by the competent authority directorate of technical education
1152290 the content of as level is half the content of a level this acceptance of combination of courses of both levels would lessen the amount of content that students will have to study over a period of two years

1152295 we are not very aggressive in acquiring new land to boost our land bank
1152296 i think we would invest rs 400 rs 500 crore out of internal accruals depending on liquidity to acquire land in this financial year
1152297 construction for most of the sezs will start in two months
1152298 in this movie whether the third person in the couples life is a man or a woman is not important all that is important is that their relationship is shattered forever
1152299 this play may have been ahead its time but it was received quite well by the audience it ran for a long time and we staged it 25 times

1152310 as i started seeing all the media on barack obama i started realising that john mccain didnt have that rally song or fight song something that can get everybody together to fight so i took it upon myself to try to write the theme song for his campaign
1152311 john mccain has been a prisoner of war and a true american hero hes been through pains and injuries and has the scars to prove it so i thought ive got to write a song that reflects that and shows how this guy is a steel rod of a patriot how hes unbendable and has always put his country before himself
1152312 the maverick spirit of the song sells particularly well to all americans even obama supporters
1152313 if i can make them understand about where john mccain has come from and the journey hes been on theres no way they cannot respect him for that
1152314 the more you get to know john mccain the more you respect the fact that hes both a patriot and an independent thinker a rebel when it means staying true to what he believes in hopefully my song will help those people out there who are starting to pay attention to him to realise what kind of guy he is

1152329 the long rod shaped structure of bacteria may help explain why print particles of higher aspect ratios are internalized more rapidly and effectively than lower aspect ratio particles

1152373 i have a few moles on my back and im really aware of the importance of getting them regularly checked out by my doctor just for peace of mind
1152374 as well as the professional checks i get my mate liz to check them on a more regular basis as they are so difficult to see yourself liz just keeps an eye out for any changes in appearance to the moles
1152375 it only takes a few minutes to do its so quick and easy that it can be done when youre getting ready before a girly night out
1152376 portraying a victim of domestic violence has been the biggest challenge i have ever faced as an actress
1152377 just playing the role has taken a huge emotional toll on my life but it is nothing compared to the pain fear and torment experienced by the thousands of women refuge supports every day
1152378 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1152379 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time
1152380 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1152381 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1152382 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1152383 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1152384 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1152385 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1152386 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1152387 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets
1152388 it is essential that we do so the remarkably strong performance of the world economy since the near universal adoption of market capitalism is testament to the benefits of increasing economic flexibility
1152389 to create another page in the storied history of mgm is the most exciting challenge ive had in my career with the support of the mgm board weve been able to make significant progress and i believe the next three years will be a testament to the power passion and creative vision of our new management team i look forward to working with the members of the mgm board to deliver on mgms promise and its future expansion plans
1152390 identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1152391 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1152392 our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand if we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks
1152393 artists get fucked it doesnt feel like a festival at all its no fun i dont know how it could ever have become so bad that the status quo should be for artists willingly to go in and be raped like that
1152394 its generally thought that comedians are rolling in cash because they can multiply the number of seats by the cost of the ticket audiences would be shocked to discover how little of the ticket price is going to the comedians
1152395 these people the venues have no purpose in the whole equation but take up way too large a chunk of the money
1152396 audiences will pick up that ecf brochure and theyll think thats where all the comedy is and its not even 50 of the comedy other comics will be excluded
1152397 we were doing 16 shows a week and making very little money and the organisers had the audacity to come backstage and tell us what jokes they thought worked and which ones we needed to change it was demeaning and insulting
1152398 this is a great opportunity youre going to be exposed to the industry
1152399 if us tv channel nbc like you it doesnt matter where they see you they have no alliance with just for laughs they couldnt give a fuck less
1152400 unlike in say music or publishing there hasnt been any revolution caused by these new online technologies its now easier for a performer to create something for the screen and get it seen around the world than it is for them to get stage time anywhere if youd told people that 10 years ago theyd have laughed at you the best parallel i can come up with is what happened with low cost airlines who uses travel agents any more there has to be a revision of the distribution system because the only people that matter in this whole equation are comedians and audiences
1152401 more chaotic and more spontaneous with less management less programming and less bureaucracy
1152402 if i want to play rockford illinois and ive never played there before ill fill out a bulletin on myspace going hey who knows a venue in rockford illinois by the end of the day ill have it booked nine out of 10 times ive done it repeatedly
1152403 and will anybody buy that 7 349 ticket to spend a day with doug
1152404 i didnt put a helluva lot of thought into what id do if it sells
1152405 but if someone comes up with 7 500 believe me i will

1152407 the plane is believed to have gone down due to a stall
1152408 we cant confirm that at this time or confirm what caused the stall
1152409 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working directly with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling
1152410 it was less efficient than having the planes electronic transmission locator working but more efficient than not having any information
1152411 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff

1152415 british columbia has changed a great deal in the intervening century and a half
1152416 she has grown to become the third largest province in confederation to boast one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world and to attain a quality of life second to none
1152417 what weve done in this vast vast land of mountains and valleys is create one of the truly diverse populations in the world
1152418 it was assumed petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1152419 we want to see a new campaign promoting destinations on the far south coast far north coast act and western nsw

1152421 they will go into a neutral easing bias to allow themselves the ability to cut in september if they so needed to
1152422 im not certain that the economy is slowing such that they need to cut in september
1152423 the aussie dollar will bounce higher after the rba statement because they wont be cutting
1152424 there was evidence of an increase in opec supply lower demand in the us

1152426 thats an awful lot of carbon we do not want emitted into the atmosphere professor mackay said
1152427 we need to look at forests through fresh eyes prof mackay said
1152428 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said
1152429 we need to start factoring in the carbon value of these forests when deciding what to do with them

1152434 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite said capt beg identifying the climbers as wilco van rooijen and cas van de gevel
1152435 his condition is not good he has some bruises and frostbite and exhaustion said brigadier mohammad akram vice president of adventure foundation pakistan and a tour organiser

1152441 aids is a very big dragon the mythological dragon was slain by saint george the original knight in shining armour but this dragon must be slain by millions and millions of foot soldiers
1152442 we know there is so much yet to be done to expand prevention treatment and care to strengthen undeveloped health systems
1152443 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1152444 this is a stunning development for which we should all be grateful
1152445 today 1 4 million people with aids are using treatments purchased by the clinton foundation
1152446 thanks to the efforts of our partners they cost about us120 129 a year
1152447 aids is a very big dragon the mythological dragon was slain by saint george the original knight in shining armour but this dragon must be slain by millions and millions of foot soldiers

1152450 winning at oulton park was fantastic but now i have to keep that going and i look forward to more of those results starting with these races
1152451 the victories gave the team a big boost and after the excitement of riding at brands hatch and gaining experience in the world superbikes i have to take up where i left off in the british championship
1152452 those wins were so good for everyone they really pumped me up and i was struggling to sleep as my mind was so active thinking about how i could get more
1152453 we had a bad start to the season and were very unlucky on several occasions but now is the time to begin pulling back serious points and making amends
1152454 ive got some really good memories of that event from last year the crowds in glasgow were fantastic so i cant wait to do it all again
1152455 taking the bikes into the city is a great way for us to open up our sport to new audiences and i hope everyone there will continue to follow the championship for the rest of the season
1152456 now he chavalia gets to get back on with his life
1152457 im not saying he went up there to kill her
1152458 they confirmed what our sense was and our belief was in this
1152459 he couldnt tell tarika had a child in her arms
1152460 what kind of world would it be if we didnt have police officers
1152461 it is all about whos succeeding in passing along higher commodities costs
1152462 is expected to continue as rising commodity and food costs work their way into the supply chain forcing consumers to pay more
1152463 beef pork and prepared foods segments were all profitable in the quarter while the chicken division showed a 44 million operating loss
1152464 on the street ground is pleated and inflated to better accommodate businesses and equipment these masses are opaque dynamic and lively on their angles like transparent crystals which feature the social life of their inhabitants
1152465 how do you deal with your wife being so successful
1152466 mccains narrowing lead traces not to any sudden up swelling in support for obama whose support has hovered around 38 percent for the past year and remains at that level today rather it traces to a decline in support of mccain especially among men registered independents and latinos simultaneously the proportion of voters who are uncommitted rose to 16 percent from only nine this may and ralph nader drew a small but important three percent mostly from mccain
1152467 what do you mean marriage troubles psht were fine see were fine
1152468 im really hungry but im too tired to fix dinner
1152469 why dont you fix yourself a salad since youve got all the stuff in the fridge
1152470 and so youre trying to tell me that you get to try to make me go on a tour of the labor and delivery ward but i cant make you have a salad twice in one day
1152471 ive already had a salad today have you had a trip to the local delivery ward i didnt think so
1152472 by the way i dont eat dressing on my salad either
1152473 because the child will get to know his first family
1152474 shouldnt it be up to the child to decide if he she wants to see the first family
1152475 well maybe we should just stop at letters and pictures

1152477 si te afliges por alguna causa externa no es ella lo que te importa sino el juicio que t haces de ella y borrar ese juicio de ti depende pero si te aflige algo que radica en tu disposici n qui n te impide rectificar tu criterio y de igual modo si te afliges por no ejecutar esta acci n que te parece sana por qu no la pones en pr ctica en vez de afligirte
1152478 all of the normal operations of the fair shall be available for use by the patrons of the jfmd including games rides and exhibitions
1152479 that the use of the fair by jfmd shall be exclusive and that no individuals that are not the invitees of jfmd shall be allowed access to the fair
1152480 we will have exclusive use of the state fairgrounds including rides and attractions the day before it opens to the general public which allows us to israelize the state fair
1152481 with about 35 000 000 being raised from approximately 30 000 households

1152489 talk about the fox guarding the hen house yeah lets have the unionized bureaucrats at the nlrb investigate unions beck violations maybe they can sit down and retell stories of how badly they have screwed nonunion workers with forced unionism schemes over the last sixty years and coddled unions in the process
1152490 norm will keep the george w bush dream alive norm coleman in the senate is a third bush term
1152491 as you just saw the al franken campaign continues to get more bizarre by the moment
1152492 al franken is in a world of hurt in this campaign minnesotans are rejecting his campaign and todays gimmick and stunt by the dfl is not going to change that
1152493 the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories
1152494 and surely struggle against him we must in every possible way who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about everything
1152495 when the power of love becomes stronger than the love of power we will have peace
1152496 more than any time in history mankind faces a crossroads
1152497 from the day we went to school we learned nothing on the contrary we were made obtuse we were wrapped in a fog of words and abstractions
1152498 ive always said that theres nothing an atheist cant do if hes really unsure whether he believes anything or not
1152499 a resource rent tax is generally viewed as more efficient than a royalty tax because it is responsive to changes in prices and costs and better rewards investment in marginal projects
1152500 chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1152501 the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate
1152502 responses to queries made by employees as to their rates of pay were met by aggressive legally orientated and threatening correspondence
1152503 supermarket trolley return is after all scarcely at the top of the employment pecking order
1152504 it is reasonable to suppose that those doing this work were desperate for employment
1152505 a year ago gav was a long way off playing senior football and this nomination is a credit to the hard work he has done since that time
1152506 he has been a valuable player since coming into the side and we are looking forward to his continued development
1152507 it was assumed petrol prices would impact on the tourism industry but nobody expected the traditional australian family holiday to have changed so much
1152508 we want to see a new campaign promoting destinations on the far south coast far north coast act and western nsw
1152509 our need is to cater to the viewer and we have a constant quest for viewer feedback and ratings quotient and there is the cost of things the athletes want things pristine and glorious when they come here there is a lot of pressure on them they dont understand the economics right now
1152510 vert skateboard is not that large connecting vert to tv viewers is hard because they dont understand how hard it is because of the growth of concrete skateparks the viewer and our demographics can connect with park skating way more it is what the kids are doing
1152511 the x games has been a very powerful forum for our sport we recognize that and appreciate that
1152512 but they have to look at what weve done for them they should listen to the guys whove had their backs the last 10 years
1152513 they have to understand our reality and we have to understand their preferences vert will not be phased out
1152514 sie wollten unbedingt jemanden im nahen osten daf r beschuldigen
1152515 wie man diese substanzen verteilt und anwendet also ziehen sie ihre schl sse daraus
1152516 sehr schnell haben uns die experten aus fort detrick gesagt dieses zeug kann keiner in einer h hle produzieren es stammt aus unserem eigenen labor
1152517 i think it is utterly irresponsible to speculate about that and i certainly wont be doing that
1152518 i certainly think australian home owners would welcome some relief but that is entirely a matter for the independent reserve bank
1152519 our may budget struck the right balance between fighting inflation on the one hand and investing in the future on the other
1152520 but we have perhaps the most difficult global conditions in over 25 years
1152521 business and consumer confidence around the world has taken a hit on the back of the global financial market turbulence and the oil shock
1152522 the treadmill is going faster than the legs at least when it comes to consumers and their spending household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1152523 without an additional government policy jolt the economy is headed for a very slow second half of 2008 either the third or fourth quarters should register negative gdp growth
1152524 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1152525 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1152526 mr freeman is listed in serious condition but we have no information on the condition of his passenger
1152527 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1152528 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1152529 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1152530 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1152531 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1152532 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1152533 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1152534 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet
1152535 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no
1152536 therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1152537 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1152538 that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1152539 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
1152540 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
1152541 there is a rule in the french competition that a player can finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
1152542 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract
1152543 we have heard from david about this matter but it is really something for the french authorities
1152544 were catching bullets in our teeth its hard to do but theyre so sweet
1152545 he crawls into her aorta he crawls like a rat inside her spine
1152546 hang my eyes up on a hook inside my own skin i fail to find myself again
1152547 is much more explicit than any recommendation out there right now
1152548 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1152549 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
1152550 there is uncertainty about whether the benefits exceed the harm based on existing evidence
1152551 most of the harms are related to treatment rather than screening
1152552 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1152553 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1152554 the best advice my dad has given me was go with your gut
1152555 and he said you cant really have expectations if i have expectations that hes going to be a rock star im sure hell come out being into sports and if i have expectations that hell be into sports then hell be into math or something
1152556 its like the second half of the record the moon side whereas the sun side is how a normal band would do it in a studio with a producer
1152557 one albums more rock and the others more electronic the sun part i liked it a lot because it is different there are a lot of acoustic instruments and vocals and when i listen to it i feel like a real band but then theres the moon side which is more like fu everything were gonna do it our way
1152558 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1152559 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1152560 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1152561 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to
1152562 i dont know if we can jump to that conclusion yet
1152563 we need to study this further we do know from two large scale clinical trials that smokers benefited more when they got plavix therapy maybe smoking does something to make plavix work better
1152564 current smoking was an independent predictor of low platelet aggregation
1152565 theres a lot of evidence to support the idea that when kids watch violent media they become more aggressive
1152566 and yet violent media has become easier and easier to access for children so for the movie industry the message is that the 1960s ratings system needs to be updated and made more explicit and relevant to the way movies are being distributed and seen today
1152567 but also parents need to be much more careful about how their children consume violent media
1152568 who would have thought id play a spicoli like character and then make out with spicoli in the same year
1152569 theres a sensitivity that exudes from him he can without trying make you see into his soul he makes it seem effortless
1152570 what do you think about me being the other girl
1152571 and he would always ask me if my girlfriend was the better kisser
1152572 punks jump up to get beat down diamond d remix
1152573 ma vedi anche l c un sacco di cose che non ci dicono mica
1152574 ma di che parli scusa io mi riferivo semplicemente al bicchiere che mera caduto di mano
1152575 appunto tu credi che sia forza di gravit quella l che aveva scoperto newton magari
1152576 t mai venuto il sospetto che magari era forza centrifuga
1152577 s forza centrifuga noi crediamo che la terra sia una sfera sospesa nel vuoto che ruoti su s stessa generi un campo gravitazionale etc no cazzate
1152578 s la terra cava in realt esiste una vasta caverna e un universo pieno di roccia compatta che ruota la sfera della terra col di fuori di dentro no insomma gira e la forza centrifuga fa s che noi si stia attaccati a terra
1152579 ah gi come sul mare quando riempi un secchiello di acqua e rena e lo ruoti e lacqua e la rena non cascano
1152580 eh tanto per iniziare newton si chiamava isaac dunque era ebreo poi sai i governi le multinazionali la cia sbroc sbroc

1152584 bernie mac is still alive and being treated in a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery
1152585 we once again ask that the press respect his privacy and that of his family
1152586 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss
1152587 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1152588 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1152589 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1152590 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1152591 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1152592 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1152593 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1152594 younger women typically have very dense breasts which makes some of the other imaging modalities such as mammography more difficult to evaluate also mris of the breast are also helpful for individuals who have a very strong family history of breast cancer
1152595 its a very expensive tool and mri is not perfect either its an additional tool mri a lot of times does pick up cancer but sometimes it may miss cancer or pick up very benign lesions that then require intervention or surgery which may not be necessary
1152596 everything flashes in front of them some that arent even married think about will i ever get married many of them think what about my fertility so theres just a whole different set of issues for these women and its very scary for them and very emotional
1152597 well just because they dont look like zombies or act like zombies doesnt mean theyre not immortal magical guardians
1152598 the coolest reveal here is that the plots plush amazonian temple is said to be guarded by the undead so on top of the rumored alien subplot it appears indy iv will be fencing off with that ambiguous x files sequel for air conditioned supernatural kicks
1152599 oh and did i mention the skull is guarded by the living dead thats right zombies
1152600 the film opens in 1957 at the height of the cold war and that the hero is on the search for a skull stolen from a lost city and guarded by the living dead
1152601 shucks theres a new mummy movie on its way and we sure dont want to be accused to ripping off the franchise that ripped off us so lets lose the living dead angle
1152602 i had to find one place of truth one dialogue without falsity
1152603 vergne who co curated the 06 whitney biennial has been a driving force behind some of the more interesting walker shows during his 10 years in minneapolis from the recent huang yong ping retrospective to his three artist heart of darkness show which featured thomas hirschhorns haunting
1152604 i hope you will take this opportunity to implement strategies that value and cherish the amazing creatures with whom we share this world

1152728 i would hope that our federal colleagues can resolve this issue because the longer it drags on the more it detracts and distracts from the important job were doing

1152863 india and afghanistan are facing the challenges of terrorism of cold blooded brutal murderous activity in our two countries and we recognise that the two countries and the world at large have no option but to be united in fighting the menace of terrorism as it affects us and as it affects the international community
1152864 as india has suffered immensely from this menace afghanistan has too therefore it is a moral responsibility for us not a political activity i would like to underline it is a moral responsibility for us as human beings to protect the lives of our women and children and to prevent the loss of life caused by terrorism by defeating terrorism and by eliminating it completely and thereby bringing security to our peoples and the world at large
1152865 most americans including reporters and editors think that hd radio stands for high definition radio a natural assumption given our experience of hdtv high definition tv wrong i would have to call it intentionally misleading the deceptive strategy has worked hd radio is a trade name it doesnt have to stand for anything but a product that product is by no means high definition radio
1152866 but just be weary someone whos been in a relationship like that might not have the same understanding of what boundaries are maybe he thinks anything but sex with someone else is still okay make sure he knows where you stand

1152868 oh dont worry molly you wont be single your whole life

1152871 i tried to stay busy with my business with my family
1152872 we didnt know how many terrorists there were what kinds of weapons they had what hostages they had
1152873 i blame the palestinians and i blame the germans for the failure to achieve the release of the athletes

1152879 winning medals in the relays is such an amazing feeling being a part of a team
1152880 i was thinking about how many races i had to swim and i saved too much energy
1152881 i learned a horrible lesson but it kind of got me going another four years i kind of felt like i had unfinished business
1152882 but to do something on your own feels pretty good i have a lot to prove to myself i know im capable i just havent done it yet
1152883 i think this is the best olympic swim team ever assembled
1152884 there are several events where we could get multiple medals and we could win all three relays
1152885 to finally be able to participate is going to be really exciting
1152886 they were in college and the international scene was more important to me
1152887 once you start getting to the games to the olympic village people are more curious of the type of things to expect more questions come up

1152907 we know people are disappointed at the way we lost the final one dayer to south africa and also the series but we also know a repeat performance against india will not be acceptable to the people
1152908 we all felt bad at the way we had gifted the match to south africa and we want to make amends in india
1152909 i have played against india and been there before so i know what it is all about so i am not going to take any extra pressure on this tour we had a brain storming session yesterday and we all know that whether we play india or any other team we have to give our best
1152910 look we handled the pressure games in the twenty20 world cup the final was a close affair and it could have gone either way
1152911 even against south africa we came back to level the series 2 2 and controlled 90 percent of the game but lost because of irresponsible and poor cricket i am confident my players can handle the pressure well in india
1152912 if the openers do well we have the depth in our middle and lower order to get big scores i am counting that since the pitches are similar in pakistan and india the openers will settle down quickly and get the runs
1152913 they use the sg balls which grip well and help the pacers and spinners well while the pitches are good for the batsmen as well once you settle in you can get runs so it should be an evenly contested series
1152914 there are things we need to go through and from that conversation we will move forward

1153035 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
1153036 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
1153037 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1153038 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1153039 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1153040 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter

1153043 if you will forgive my use of the term global
1153044 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit
1153045 this is perhaps one of the most commonly asked questions
1153046 a cursory examination of a flat earth map fairly well explains the reason the north pole is central and antarctica comprises the entire circumference of the earth circumnavigation is a case of travelling in a very broad circle across the surface of the earth
1153047 as a rule of thumb we dont have any fears of aircraft or other modes of transportation
1153048 flat earth theory is one of the ultimate conspiracy theories
1153049 naturally flat earth believers think that the moon landings were faked as were the photographs of earth from space
1153050 it is always good to question how we know what we know but it is also good to have the ability to accept compelling evidence such as the photographs of earth from space

1153056 hasta el momento la mejor manera de ayudar a un paciente con una alergia alimentaria determinada es velar por que no consuma el alimento causante de la reacci n y proporcionarle al paciente o a sus familiares una compleja

1153113 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1153114 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1153115 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1153116 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1153117 farm income is expected to exceed the 10 year average by 50 this year yet congress bill asks american taxpayers to subsidize the incomes of married farmers who earn 1 5 million per year
1153118 when we began this on friday at 11 20 a m we didnt know where it was going to lead
1153119 but we have been buoyed and heartened by the american people and what they have said is thank you for leading
1153120 there will be many more hours of speeches today and throughout the week
1153121 whether the house is in session or not the republicans on the floor today have always gone out of their way to protect the oil companies that fund their campaigns
1153122 all told the house republicans leading this weeks efforts have taken more than 3 million in campaign contributions from big oil companies
1153123 for six years republicans controlled every branch of government and did nothing while america became more dependent on foreign sources of oil
1153124 house republicans now want to dust off old proposals rejected by congress on a bipartisan basis as bad ideas and claim they have put forward solutions
1153125 but its history because whats happened is your congress has not lived up to its responsibility to you
1153126 i think its safe to say that were going to try and keep this going for a while
1153127 she has great looks and is a fierce competitor unless her game unravels completely she will clean up in the next few years as long as she stays in the top five or so

1153129 i dont understand why dermatologists would recommend these products to patients without being able to examine a well designed peer reviewed study

1153132 this period of time feels a lot like 1991 and 1992
1153133 the issues were similar with that recession high oil prices fear of oil availability and some housing issues
1153134 in my 38 years in the business these are the most challenging times ive seen
1153135 the fact of the matter is were getting a dose of reality weve had five to 10 years of a housing bubble low interest rates low fuel costs economic growth and credit availability that may not have been the real level this may be more normal
1153136 the unfolding credit situation customers are facing in dealerships will take center stage
1153137 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
1153138 thats why were accelerating production of four cylinder models and quickly responding to market conditions with repurposed u s plants and plans for a u s built prius
1153139 the uncertainties in the market have been quite profound in the past few weeks
1153140 we are adjusting our production to meet the rapidly changing needs of buyers and are confident these changes will provide the needed inventory as we move forward
1153141 our products give a great combination of economy and capability that has allowed us to grow our market share every month this year and we now have our highest market share ever

1153215 its not a legally recognized marriage in the state of utah so to run it as such i find offensive thats no different than running somebody else who decides to live together without benefit of marriage
1153216 for them to say that the marriage was going to take place in salt lake city on the 8th of august they knew that wasnt true
1153217 but they ran it anyway under political correctness or for whatever reason they chose to do that
1153218 its no different than if the paper had run the marriage of a polygamist man who had several wives and run it in the paper i really would be curious if the herald journal would have run a picture like that too
1153219 pleased to announce their marriage at memory grove park in salt lake city
1153220 the herald journal released a statement saying that since wedding ads are paid space it has a responsibility to give all paying customers equal access to the service

1153225 great despite totally unpredictable weather and days that you would think arent going to be good but then they turn out to be great
1153226 we keep getting some fresh snow to work with every other day and just the right amount to cover old tracks and give a new nice base but not so much so that it gets dramatically unstable so that we cant move around safely so this has meant great skiing lately with of course respect for new snow and also a lot of attention to timings and following temperatures etc our worst days now are when we get days with a few clouds and bad visibility but not any new snow which means that we can neither ski powder comfortably nor do we get a good spring snow transformation so we are touring a bit at the moment and we had a great mini tour with a night in the col des fourshut last weekend 13 14 april and despite henrys snoring which kept us all awake we had a great time so lets hope the conditions stays good until the end and personally with the great base we have now we should have lots more good skiing until the end of the season

1153230 michaels training is going really well and by the time we get back hell be ready to train with the group

1153239 this match organised by an italian humanitarian association will pit our national team against the stars of european football including manchester uniteds cristiano ronaldo and ac milans brazilian kaka
1153240 the revenue will go to orphans in iraq and the children of our country suffering from incurable diseases
1153241 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1153242 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1153243 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1153244 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1153245 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season
1153246 to be fair to nicky he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere
1153247 but we have no need to sell anyone and im not going to give anyone away
1153248 we had a situation where we had set aside this coming saturday for gareth barrys testimonial that obviously is in abeyance
1153249 the sight of a middle age german man frantically searching for his mobile phone and muttering wo ist mein handy is enough to make a heterosexual male pluck his eyebrows and wear lycra for a month
1153250 i said all along that i thought they would be a reasonable side and i thought they were a better side than the team they had at this stage last year
1153251 the noises coming from their camp as you would expect is that they fancy their chances but of course we do too
1153252 they also had a few chances at ibrox but i think its safe to say that if we had put one of our chances away we would have won the game comfortably
1153253 it wasnt to be and we now have the hard work to do on tuesday
1153254 we werent surprised by them at ibrox they set out their stall in the manner i felt they would do and their coach has definitely had a good assessment of what he had to cover to make it difficult for us to play
1153255 they have decent defenders and a good goalkeeper and we knew they would be able to make it a difficult game at ibrox
1153256 it will be a big test for us in the sense that we havent reached the level of play that we did last season or the edge in our game we have to make sure thats the case tomorrow night
1153257 we are more or less settled and know what we will do
1153258 thats the managers prerogative and whether it is the right choice or the wrong choice always depends on the result
1153259 i think he is a player we will have to watch i dont think he looked as though he was 70 fit at ibrox he looked fit to me until nearer the end of the game

1153637 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
1153638 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon

1153640 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
1153641 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs

1153710 why should i take your gospel seriously why should i even entertain the possibility that jesus rose from the dead if the bible isnt correct about genesis 1 11 what reason do i have to believe that its correct about jesus
1153711 we were pretty much expecting those kids to come in kind of late
1153712 we just kind of put that into our time my upperclassmen were ready to go but we just had to sit tight while we got those younger cats their stuff were ready to go now
1153713 we had a guy that started for two years before me
1153714 now ive got to step it up because ill be a junior just kind of follow in his footsteps because he was a good leader
1153715 lots of schools do this but it is something i started when i came here in 2001
1153716 its cool i left the house at 10 p m and it was 98 degrees
1153717 this is my 23rd year in this district and we came out and did a county fair with different types of agility drills for four days and then put them in pads the fifth day
1153718 i figure we can condition them and teach them have them learn offense and defense during individual group and team time just as good as running them to death and discouraging them if we make it interesting theyll keep them coming back
1153719 hopefully our numbers will increase in the next few days
1153720 we used to in college always have oxygen ready for those guys that would get so nervous theyd hyperventilate
1153721 everybody who didnt show up this summer it will probably affect them the first two or three days out here
1153722 the fact that we knew it was going to be hot was why we started at 7 a m
1153723 most of them have worked out all summer in our conditioning program im not worried about those kids im worried about the ones who were sitting on the couch all summer
1153724 first of all we got to stay together as a team last year we were falling apart during the game
1153725 weve just got to stay together and work hard as a team strive for excellence
1153726 it will get me prepared for college to see what i can do by myself
1153727 were going to try and run a two platoon system so we can prepare our guys for an offensive and defensive position we dont want them to play two ways but they may have to at a point in time with injuries
1153728 its going to be tough to make the playoffs but we think we can beat one of the favorites
1153729 we want to make the playoffs and win in the playoffs
1153730 i feel a lot more comfortable at the varsity level and i think were going to surprise some people
1153731 i think they were kind of fresh yesterday today they came out and they were a little tired
1153732 the legs were tired but they fought through it same principle you fight through fatigue with good technique attention to detail thats how we get better
1153733 hey stover my cars messed up youre paying for it
1153734 we are trying to convince an ignorant public that there is an alternative to microsoft
1153735 most of my money would be in repairs or showing them how to use linux more effectively you dont get the repeat business as you do with microsoft from rebooting machines
1153736 it will take a few years before linux will make a difference
1153737 when we set the customer up with linux we will be able to make a big noise for linux i will be moving from the consumer to the small business
1153738 in some ways my career has been a series of assignments if theres the opportunity to mould things or be involved in change thats always attracted me
1153739 the money and the on the job training was more attractive
1153740 there was a lot of change and a lot of growth in the market in europe in the 1980s new zealanders were well sought after because of their work ethic
1153741 id tried to ski in new zealand and i hated the weather and the conditions but in austria the set up was great and i was hooked
1153742 that background prepared me well when youre working for networking or security companies you have to understand the fundamentals its what partners and clients quite rightly expect
1153743 when companies are looking to cut costs they look at the remote locations and they chose to bow out of new zealand and go back to australia
1153744 there were lots of stresses but also lots of opportunity
1153745 it was another change environment and i was used to that there was great opportunity to effect change and take a leadership role
1153746 i was involved in wide ranging solutions across the whole of it so the background in both it and t telco was critical to that
1153747 a good partner programme that creates value for clients and your partners is critical
1153748 that was one of the questions when i did my due diligence around the role and the organisation the reality is well acquire not be acquired and stay firmly on security

1153753 obviously we are very happy the boys have been working hard at it and they got their reward
1153754 one of the more bizarre performances for an australian lineout
1153755 choosing 47 medals during our initial development worked better than imagined because the 47 trophies with the appropriate point values for bronze silver and gold trophies perfectly equaled the maximum number of trophies that can be awarded

1154121 we had more people and not all human it was impossible to lock everything down as tightly as you do here so when the hellmouth started getting frisky the government units in town approached the council about funding a tv show to make with the distraction it wasnt exactly a documentary but it was close enough to the truth to neutralize most of the rumors youd be surprised how blind people can be if they have a convenient excuse handy

1154204 its difficult to ask somebody to get behind something they dont really believe in i mean obviously he believes in the music and the itunes and that whole side of things and the media side of things and he gets it and he pushes it and they do wonderful things with that but hes not a gamer thats just the bottom line about it

1154210 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1154211 weve questioned the statutory authority of monticello getting into the fiber optic business

1154218 at first when this was introduced to us i didnt like it because i wasnt able to see the place the one thing that blocked me was the traffic because i was already staying in this place i already know how the traffic worked but we were convinced by our agent her name was becky just to take a look at the place
1154219 so we took a look and when i saw the development the arrangement of the buildings how it is i immediately liked it its really a totally different concept
1154220 what made us decide was the location the planning and its away from noisy main avenues
1154221 the general look of the building is one of the factors that really attracted me apart from that the theme of the place the architecture composed of fluid lines the color combinations good it really reflects a serene place to live in its conducive to promoting peace of mind relaxation
1154222 i also appreciate the courtesy extended by the security people the industriousness of the maintenance people every effort is being done to make this place livable i appreciate that
1154223 a number of factors adversely affected earnings and caused the second quarter to fall short of expectations including challenges in our manufacturing segment and the impact of a rate case decision in minnesota
1154224 shoremasters results were affected by reduced sales in a difficult economy and the closing of its california production facility following the completion of a major marina project but the biggest impact in this segment came from dmi
1154225 essentially we are experiencing significant growing pains at dmi as the company ramps up at its newer locations and continues to integrate new customers dmi is our fastest growing company and a leader in the flourishing wind energy industry this will be a year of expanding production capabilities not one of record breaking results however we see great potential in 2009 and beyond as dmi continues to increase output across its production locations
1154226 the approved rate increase was lower than interim rates in effect since the end of november 2007 minnesota retail customers will receive a rate refund with interest and the projected refund was recorded as a liability in the second quarter
1154227 in addition we are seeing the impact of higher energy and fuel costs on the results at our food ingredient and transportation businesses
1154228 although we expect improved earnings in the second half of 2008 we do not expect to make up the second quarter shortfall and reach the 2008 earnings guidance set forth last quarter therefore given the second quarter results and uncertainty with economic conditions for the balance of the year we are lowering earnings per share guidance to a range of 1 40 to 1 65 from our previous guidance of 1 75 to 2 00
1154229 overall we are pleased with our long standing diversification strategy and the opportunities that have emerged in both our electric and nonelectric businesses we are experiencing growth in the core electric business in 2008 beyond 2008 we see significant growth prospects in our nonelectric business as well particularly at dmi industries despite some recent growing pains at dmi we are investing to position our company to capitalize on the strong opportunity ahead in the wind industry
1154230 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1154231 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves
1154232 i do not believe that we should use this strategic oil reserves at this point
1154233 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency

1154274 conservatism is a term used to describe political philosophies that favour tradition where tradition refers to various religious cultural or nationally defined beliefs and customs it is difficult to define the term precisely because different cultures have different established values and in consequence conservatives in different cultures have differing goals
1154275 what im really happy about is that by taking the mummy out of egypt and putting it in china by exploring a different approach to the quest for immortality we now have it clear that the mummy franchise can travel now we know that if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because theres a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures they have a lot of mummies the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found so i think that somehow that might make the basis of a good story

1154329 normal play behavior was virtually absent throughout the lives of highly violent anti social men the opposite of play is not work its depression
1154330 we are designed to play we need 3d motion the smarter the creature the more they play the sea squirt auto digests its brain when it becomes sessile
1154331 the riskless competition between speculative choices if its predictable its not play the opposite of play is not what is serious but what is real the paradox is that you cant be serious if you dont play

1154334 it is possible that science is valued by most americans as another form of magic
1154335 in fact your brain cant directly know where your body ends and the world begins
1154336 your brain constantly makes predictions about the very fabric of the world we live in and it does so in a parallel fashion what we perceive that is how the world appears to us does not come solely from our senses what we perceive is a combination of what we sense and our brains memory derived predictions

1154338 it should be physically possible to do the work of all the computers on earth today using a single watt of power
1154339 of course we use these computers to make better design software and manufacturing control algorithms and so the progress continues

1154346 sometimes i ask myself how it came about that i happened to be the one to discover the theory of relativity the reason is i think that the normal adult never stops to think about space and time whatever thinking he may do about these things he will already have done as a small child i on the other hand was so slow to develop that i only began thinking about space and time when i was already grown up
1154347 hidden in this remark is an acceptance of himself as an eternal child this prodigy of thought was eternally a child prodigy and if that would seem to diminish the man remember that it was a child who cried out that the emperor had no clothes all his life einstein would point to this or that ruling thought and reveal its nakedness until finally it was the prevailing universe that had no clothes
1154348 our minds and selves are created by the interplay of the memes not only are memes replicators like genes but human consciousness itself is a product of memes
1154349 the mind is a bubbling congeries of unsupervised parallel processing

1154357 creating a new life form is a means of understanding the genome and understanding the gene sets we dont have enough scientists on the planet enough money and enough time using traditional methods to understand the millions of genes we are uncovering so we have to develop new approaches to understand empirically what the different genes do in developing living systems
1154358 man considered with himself for in a way man mentally was one he consisted of a trillion trillion trillion ageless bodies each in its place each resting quiet and incorruptible each cared for by perfect automatons equally incorruptible while the minds of all the bodies freely melted one into the other indistinguishable
1154359 the best way to predict the future is to invent it
1154360 more profound is the prospect of humanity dividing into the gene rich and gene poor bear in mind that forecasters always overestimate effects in the near future and underestimate the farther future the farther future these days is still in our lifetimes
1154361 the age of nations is past the task before us now if we would not perish is to build the earth
1154362 we can dream as the prisoner tzinacan in the novel
1154363 we have not understood much about our own planet and our own environment
1154364 weve been missing as much as 99 percent of the life forms and biology out there
1154365 when you look at microbes they dont appear to be individual species
1154366 microbial communities are almost like a superorganism where each microbe is contributing to community as a whole
1154367 we really need to characterize the metagenome and analyze the genes and protein products as an aggregate

1154396 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1154397 this is a stunning development for which we should all be grateful

1154412 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1154413 the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires
1154414 so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
1154415 i ask you to join me in november and in the years to come to ensure that we will not only control our own energy but once again control our own destiny and forge a new and better future for the country that we love
1154416 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire
1154417 to do this we will invest 150 billion over the next 10 years and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses american energy and creates 5 million new american jobs

1154420 but whats probability that it will stay through launch go through re entry and stay on the spacecraft
1154421 and then if it gets jostled off could it survive and grow and reproduce at each point theres a lower and lower probability

1154429 i am more than willing to share who i am and to open up my heart and soul to people so that they know that in addition to getting barack this tremendous mind and person to lead our country that the people behind him and beside him his wife and family that we all represent what is good and wonderful about america
1154430 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways
1154431 the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1154432 dont vote for barack because you think hes cute or because you like his smile this can be a purely objective decision because the choices are pretty clear are on the table the fate and the direction of this country for the next four or eight years is on the table and i would just urge people to be informed about the issues and then decide

1154438 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1154439 this time they actually managed to carry out their plan but it will not affect the olympics greatly

1154466 k2 is the peak to climb in the himalayas it is a pyramid of rock with very little snow and a lot of ice
1154467 it is not like everest where there are fixed ropes bottled oxygen and sherpas who set camps and carry loads which make it possible for less practiced climbers those who take on the challenge of k2 are the best they have the right people and the right idea they will turn back but it is the unknown and unpredictable factors that make it so dangerous
1154468 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis theres a lot of strong characters in the dressing room yesterday i sat down with peter and we had a really good discussion about how we want to take this team forward we need to unite we need to get on to the same hymnsheet we need to get this team going forward the crux of yesterdays meeting was to determine where peter and myself can take this team
1154469 im 100 confident we can have a good working relationship i wouldnt be sitting here today if i wasnt confident everything is going to be perfectly fine
1154470 to be totally honest the most exciting thing is that ive had text messages and phone calls from the senior players in the squad who basically said were right behind you we support you give it a shot
1154471 once youve got the support of the lads around you who are with you the whole time theres nothing more you can ask for i hope it wont restrict the way i play i play the way i play and ive been successful so far if it doesnt work and it affects a few things in terms of my personal life if it affects the way i bat and all that then i will be man enough to say so
1154472 i was disappointed i wasnt thought of as captain but once the selectors decided they wanted to unify the test and one day jobs it was a non starter for me
1154473 i definitely feel i could have made a decent fist of the test captaincy and would have benefited from the time i previously did the job but it was not to be and there is not much i can do about the selectors decision there is no point feeling sorry for myself what i have to do now is get behind kevin
1154474 it crossed my mind for a couple of minutes that i may get the job but i probably am too young

1154484 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high

1154507 there may have been a couple of dogs that had been mauled not killed but just slapped around and it might have been in response to it walking in the area and the dogs kinda going after it and then it trying to defends itself
1154508 its baited with some meat and its got some pressure points in it so if the animal goes in and touches these pressure points the gate will close and trap it in the trap
1154509 animals in this area are probably being dispersed by human activity including ours here so its probably just a little confused and being young its probably just looking for its own territory this is an area that hasnt been staked out more than likely in recent years so this young cougar is trying its luck
1154510 what people should do if they see the animal of course is try to get indoors and if they are out at night they should be carrying flashlights
1154511 they should just be cognizant of their whereabouts and keep an eye on their children not let their children out at night by themselves unattended and just to be vigilant
1154512 we do our best to react to any sort of reports but its best if we can have a print or a photo or something that we can have in our hands
1154513 until we can actually see one thats the best we can do
1154514 the bottom line is most of our counties except the southern counties along the mississippi river are only 10 percent forest
1154515 we dont have a lot of forest these animals should be seen quite a bit especially during deer season for seven days of the year theres a lot of people out in the woods we dont get those cougars reported then
1154516 theres a better chance of something being seen in those seven days than any other time of the year the leaves are off people are walking around shooting guns scaring animals yet we just dont have anything reported
1154517 i was just driving along and it kind of surprised me
1154518 these two half grown cubs run across the road and into the field and into the woods i go a little further and here were a flock of turkeys in the field i think they were down in my stubble field stalking these turkeys
1154519 theres plenty of food down there for them too theres lots of turkeys and deer that whole area along the kaskaskia river they can hide very easily
1154520 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
1154521 senator obama doesnt appear to have the ability to hold the traditional democratic coalition together as well as mrs clinton might
1154522 ill vote for whoever can bring the price of gas down
1154523 one thing i keep seeing is a lack of wherewithal to tackle the tough issues like health care illegal immigration
1154524 its sort of like overhauling the tax code if there was an easy way to tackle it without conflict they would have done it already at some point it takes some backbone to get it done get some backbone and decide what you stand for
1154525 music comes closest to meditation just beyond music is meditation one step more and you are in meditation and music is the most beautiful door listen to music so totally that the listener disappears in the listening that there is only music and you are not that you are an emptiness and the music fills you there is no observer even nobody to appreciate to judge listen to music without judgement without evaluation and it will become your deepest meditation

1154533 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
1154534 everyone of course was anti bolshevik in the circle in which i grew up
1154535 such social tension within me that it somehow defined the path i was to follow for the rest of my life
1154536 it is precisely because our state through sheer force of habit tradition and inertia continues to cling to this false doctrine with all its tortuous aberrations that it needs to put the dissenter behind bars
1154537 the revolting invasion of commercial advertising tv stupor and intolerable music

1154584 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1154585 the attitude to solzhenitsyn in russia resembles a pendulum and i can feel it from my conversations with young writers there was huge interest in the 1970s and 1980s when he was banned and exiled there was a kind of disillusionment in the 1990s when he returned to the country which was absorbed in its daily problems and had no time for his preachings then finally there was a rebirth of interest and respect during his last years
1154586 we admired solzhenitsyn because in the late 1960s he stood alone against the totalitarian state we worried for him sincerely i knew people who hid his portrait in their apartments in order to show it to friends as some sort of a status symbol
1154587 even if solzhenitsyn was not the author of an anti semitic brochure which was ascribed to him in the 1960s a lot of the views which he expressed in the last years of his life basically match the lies of that brochure
1154588 as a thinker he was sometimes controversial for example he lambasted gorbachev and yeltsin the very people who made his return to russia in 1994 possible and he was friendly with putin who undid a lot of things established under gorbachev and yeltsin how can one understand this
1154589 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
1154590 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
1154591 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history

1154607 both of us were in pretty good shape for these matches but i had the mental belief that i could win and once you win against someone for the first time you have the feeling that you can do it again and again
1154608 i think it also gets into their heads if they beat you five or six times and you come back to win against them winning a masters series event is tough and it will be hard to follow that up but it gives you a lot of confidence knowing that you can do it
1154609 the first three times i played him djokovic i wasnt in such good physical shape he killed me in monte carlo but this time i was in good shape if you put the work in off the court then you can eliminate all the possible excuses and just go into the match not thinking about physical shape and how much practice you have put in

1154717 we approached this cd no different from any of the other albums weve done we just wanted to make the best possible album we could make obviously our influences are different now than they were back in the day and i think the songs reflect that we had a little more time with this one so we were really able to work on getting better sounds all the way around the guitar sound and drum sound are much better than they were on sins of the past

1154757 im praying this little story doesnt jump the pond especially as the later summer slow news cycle sets in
1154758 lets hope that doesnt get picked up by some sc tourist and brought back it would be a classic case of a picture doing the damage of a thousand words
1154759 the different departments of the beijing police have taken detailed precautions for the olympic torch relay
1154760 we can say we are sufficiently prepared in every way possible
1154761 the torch relay will happen without incident warmly and joyously
1154762 im feeling good i am happy to be here and to have got this far and im looking forward to starting the marathon
1154763 i want to go to the start line knowing that i can go out there and do myself justice and run well
1154764 fis takes note of the result and reiterates its complete shock at a controversy that involves an athlete that has always been distinguished for his sportsmanship and correctness
1154765 the surprise is even greater given that baldini like all the other top level fencers in the italian national team has repeatedly undergone tests during the course of the season that have always been negative
1154766 the itf is very disappointed with the decision and feels that the precedent set today could ultimately harm the rights of international federations
1154767 it is very disturbing for the itf and should be for the ioc when players who do not meet the itf qualification criteria approved by the ioc are entered at the expense of players who qualified and deserve to represent their countries at the 2008 olympic games
1154768 the developers cannot take advantage of the fact that it is the olympics and expect impunity for taking away my house
1154769 reporters from china and other countries welcome to my family and interview my human rights experience
1154770 but they shouldnt have destroyed my house forcibly evicted me and left me homeless
1154771 we dont want to see our nation going down the path of military confrontation but it all depends on the type of policy carried out by chinese authorities in the region
1154772 i want to emphasise that people cant tolerate the systematic suppression any longer
1154773 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1154774 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1154775 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1154776 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1154777 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1154778 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1154779 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets
1154780 the take away message is that there is no single estimate that pertains to every sexual contact
1154781 claims in both the popular media and the peer reviewed literature that hiv is very difficult to transmit heterosexually are dangerous in any context where the possibility of hiv exposure exists

1154790 the prelude has aged really well i never liked it when it was new it just seemed to easy too clean too sleek too short on character now of course its wedgy lines are very pretty very nicely executed and theres something about those late 1980s early 1990s honda interiors that just feel right with great visibility good comfort without being overly fancy

1154801 foreclosures not only devastate families they hurt neighborhoods and depress our economy and our budget
1154802 when they were suitably refreshed they came back and let him out
1154803 we were paying or rather the taxpayer was paying rushdie to protect him
1154804 hes made up a whole bunch of lies i became extremely friendly and fond of the police officers who protected me they were extremely scrupulous and would never behave so cruelly to me get drunk on duty or do anything else he has said at the end of my nine years of protection they even held a party for me he has not checked his facts i was never locked in a cupboard nor was i suicidal none of these things happened
1154805 after studying the schedule of real madrid and the dutch team i realised playing for both teams would mean too tough a physical load for me and therefore i made this choice
1154806 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling
1154807 i had a comprehensive conversation with ruud and i can do nothing else but respect his decision
1154808 i regret it that i cant use his quality and experience when i compose my squad but i wish him all the best at real madrid
1154809 the selectors had a decision to make they spoke long and hard about which direction they wanted to go in
1154810 if they wanted a captain for all three formats including twenty20 the list would have been short
1154811 im not involved in two of the formats and alastair cook hasnt been in the twenty20 side recently
1154812 i would have liked to have done the test job and to that degree i am disappointed i have not been given the opportunity
1154813 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1154814 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some used to someone else being in charge
1154815 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1154816 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1154817 kp is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1154818 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1154819 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1154820 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1154821 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him
1154822 hes an excellent batter and demands respect with his batting hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1154823 okay so last time i told you he had put his pinkie in my butt well i liked it so much i decided to try the real thing with this other man i met in a chat room yeah i finally had anal sex i think i liked it even more than the stud did i didnt know you could cum like that from your ass or else i would have tried it a long time ago

1155194 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
1155195 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race

1155400 few of us are aware of the extent to which weve disclosed details about our identities and lives or the way those details can be mined from search logs or other databases and linked back to us
1155401 hyperefficient data processors as cogs in an intellectual machine whose workings and ends are beyond us
1155402 we may question the technological imperative and even withstand it but such acts will always be lonely and in the end futile
1155403 given its geographic diversity strength of funding and core capital
1155404 as such we advise investors to wait for improved visibility preferring lloyds tsb in the sector
1155405 a powerful set of results demonstrating that the structural drivers within intertek remain strong
1155406 although the shares look cheap the high level of borrowing remains a big obstacle to a bid
1155407 at the higher value added end of the supply chain and put us closer to our key customers in the uk and wider european union
1155408 remained strong supported by demand from both food and biofuels industries
1155409 we believe the uk economic downturn is taking its toll on advertising budgets sooner and faster than we expected at the beginning of the year
1155410 our goal is to deliver an incomparable local event experience to msn users
1155411 with zvents our users can now quickly and easily find any event happening in their local area whether a hot rod car show concert in the park back to school sale or celebrity book signing virtually whatever suits their interests is presented in detail and immediately accessible
1155412 together with msn were now able to provide millions of people with the most complete and robust index of local content
1155413 as a part of the zvents network msn adds tremendous value to local advertisers trying to both broaden their reach and more precisely target customers with timely information across the web
1155414 duvidoso que o p blico resolva os seus problemas com imagens sem uma linha editorial clara
1155415 whether it is just brinkmanship we dont know but if they dont sign up there are risks for baa and for the rest of us
1155416 complicity to introduce false data into a computer system the official said
1155417 knowingly helping jerome kerviel to record fictitious operations at the bank in 2007 and january 2008
1155418 assisted witness a legal status half way between a simple witness and being charged
1155419 a momentous economic slowdown is now under way we believe the deterioration in spain is just in the beginning stages the bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009
1155420 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital
1155421 we estimate that a non performing loan ratio of 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto
1155422 the economic situation is worse than we all predicted we thought it would happen slowly but instead it has hit fast
1155423 what was the state supposed to do stop people building houses that wouldnt be reasonable tell the banks who they can lend money too we couldnt do that either we warned that building 800 000 homes a year was not sustainable and that granting mortgages for 40 years was folly but there are certain things the government cannot prohibit
1155424 you just cant get it and so without that the customer needs to come up with 10pc down deposit that might not sound like a lot but when youre a family living on 35 000 its an impossible amount of money
1155425 there is a frenzy going on in some parts of town
1155426 the press says the market is bad but a buyer goes into a property and there are 15 other people standing in front of him
1155427 but locals are sick of talking about it we all know its a mess but were fed up of hearing about it
1155428 there was a need to do some business the market went crashing down and we needed to do something about it
1155429 the investment market is difficult because you need 25pc to 30pc down in the form of a deposit and to get a loan which is applicable for fannie or freddie coverage the two main government sponsored mortgage agencies you cant own more than four or five properties
1155430 i dont believe the emerging markets have completely decoupled there is no way a serious downturn in the us will leave asia immune
1155431 in asia it is apparent that corporate activity in some sectors is slowing
1155432 any meaningful recovery in the housing market unlikely before next year
1155433 there can be no prospect of a fundamental recovery in this business
1155434 the issue now is whether the us enters a recession and what that does to the credit card and unsecured books
1155435 we continue to have the capacity to deploy capital at a time when others may be constrained
1155436 there is no chance of doing a deal when people have a huge backlog of supply on their books and just want to get rid of the stuff
1155437 the whole sentiment is very negative this is not a concern yet but it could start to matter next year when debt matures and companies need to refinance
1155438 believe it undervalues the business and have decided not to agree to due diligence
1155439 with the economy expected to slow further at least in the short term businesses need to be particularly diligent about managing their operations to ensure they remain financially stable throughout the challenging conditions
1155440 the pressures of high food and oil prices are forcing households to cut back on real levels of consumption
1155441 the board of imperial confirms it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company
1155442 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made
1155443 an ugly combination of weak gdp growth poor international competitiveness and rising government borrowing costs
1155444 the quiet majority of million and millions of windows vista users out there are going to have a great experience
1155445 its wrong to deny funding for non religious purposes to non profit groups or individuals simply because they are religious
1155446 the court made the correct decision when it ruled that florida voters should have a voice in determining whether the state constitution will continue to allow religious discrimination in public programs
1155447 its a shame that some groups wish to remove the right of the people to determine where they receive badly needed social services
1155448 religious non profits provide innumerable benefits in this regard to the citizens of florida particularly to individuals who have no where else to turn
1155449 triple whammy of factors was paving the way for a boom once interest rates were cut again
1155450 not only is the rental market super tight but population growth continues to strengthen and speculation has shifted to rate cuts mr james said
1155451 if rates are cut in coming months investors could easily swing from cash based investments and the share market to the property market
1155452 about right given they rose by 8 2 per cent in the year to june identical to the 20 year average of the australian bureau of statistics house price index
1155453 we are not inclined to say that cablevision rather than the user does the copying produced by the rs dvr system
1155454 although the transmit clause is not a model of clarity we believe that when congress speaks of transmitting a performance to the public it refers to the performance created by the act of transmission
1155455 would not directly infringe plaintiffs exclusive rights to reproduce and publicly perform their copyrighted works
1155456 this is a tremendous victory for consumers which will allow us to make dvrs available to many more people faster and less expensively than would otherwise be possible
1155457 we appreciate the courts perspective that from the standpoint of existing copyright law remote storage dvrs are the same as the traditional dvrs that are in use today
1155458 after last years competition we made some adjustments to try and get more student entrants and to get more schools interested in incorporating it into their curriculum
1155459 this year we felt it would be much more relevant to try and tackle some of these tough community based problems
1155460 it really failed because the philadelphia housing authority didnt have the budget to maintain
1155461 as a result l amp i had to tear a lot of them down
1155462 you look at ludlow today it has the same problems as it had in the 60s
1155463 these recent developments are not without their drawbacks however the starkest of which is a severe reduction in density and a suburban building pattern
1155464 many blocks newly developed seem suburban driveways outnumber pedestrians once the new houses are occupied the neighborhood will still lack adequate recreation facilities commercial activity and educational resources to support new residents
1155465 this new construction will hardly make a dent in a sea of vacant blocks and parcels dotted with crumbling older homes reminders of a historic architectural aesthetic that has all but disappeared there is neither an existing neighborhood plan nor a functional citywide comprehensive plan to guide ludlows contemporary development it will take fresh thinking and true vision to rebuild and revive this disinvested community
1155466 den v lb rgade richard von knecht faller fr n en balkong och landar p en taxi p gatan
1155467 we do not believe that an rs dvr customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a vcr user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customers command
1155468 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1155469 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1155470 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1155471 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1155472 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies

1155487 bill risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1155488 we are concerned that some of the proposals being put forward by the government in the counter terrorism bill would place inappropriate responsibilities on parliament
1155489 we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced we are also critical of the proposal that ministers should be able to order that an inquest be held without a jury

1155492 these approvals provide flexibility and confidence to physicians to use well proven and well accepted therapies as first line treatment
1155493 patients may also benefit by getting their blood pressure effectively and quickly under control with a single pill and fewer co pays
1155494 we are very pleased that the fda recognizes the therapeutic value and the need of some patients to start therapy with a single pill combination
1155495 these approvals demonstrate our confidence in combination medications for this therapeutic category while reinforcing the novartis commitment to provide physicians with well researched and effective treatments for high blood pressure
1155496 the order books for wide bodied commercial aircraft continue to increase despite higher oil prices largely due to the strength of the aerospace markets outside north america particularly those in the middle east asia and china

1155500 unprecedented measures to ensure the success of the beijing olympics
1155501 as a result of disruptions to transport and manufacturing in the beijing area with the olympic games delivery of critical items of plant for the upgrade of the processing facilities at the caijiaying mine to a capacity of 750 000 tonnes of ore per annum have been delayed
1155502 as a result completion of the upgrade is not now expected until the end of 2008
1155503 i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1155504 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles

1155506 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is

1155509 our advertisement sic on television and the internet is very very good except for local television
1155510 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class

1155512 we realize there are going to have to be several things to reduce and eradicate domestic violence
1155513 this in and of itself will not be the total solution
1155514 only risks to the security of our vital interests or egregious offences to our most cherished political values should disqualify a nation from entering into a free trade agreement with us

1155519 sherlock holmes we start october 6th guy ritchies take on it was that its like well be making a contemporary version of a very classic portrayal of exactly how it was but its not telling one of the stories from one of the books or anything like that watson its all there the cool thing about sherlock holmes was hes actually a very skilled martial artist so its going to have elements of that its not just his deduction and all that stuff its going to be a very action packed version of that to me its really exciting im always training im big into martial arts were putting together a team of people were going to try to do something a little more transcendent and interesting i love the idea of martial arts and bare knuckle boxing before the queensbury rules where it was all kind of proper it was this real balls to the wall brutal type stuff guy ritchies a martial artist and martial arts student so were going to have a real fun time doing all that
1155520 basically the psp version was cancelled because of control issues when it was ported over to the psp the controls simply didnt translate well and instead of pushing out the product with translated controls it was cancelled

1155543 there will also be a range of events where ministers will engage with the people of the region and that is consistent with the governments approach towards engagement and consultation the prime minister has always made it clear he wants to listen and learn from the experience of people and the challenges they face in their daily lives
1155544 imitation is the sincerest form of flattery gordon brown is listening learning and stealing ideas from the snp
1155545 the prime minister remains in charge while he is on holiday he continues to remain closely involved in all the issues

1155549 trying to play politics with an extremely serious issue is typical of the first minister and this issue is of huge importance to many of my constituents
1155550 instead of trying and failing to ingratiate himself on the world stage mr salmond should turn his mind to reducing class sizes making our streets safer and helping people affected by the credit crunch
1155551 scotland has got two parliaments and two governments and alex salmond needs to stop grandstanding on the world stage and get on with what he was elected to do
1155552 the purpose of the first ministers letter was to clearly state our opposition and that of the scottish parliament people of scotland and scottish civic society to these abhorrent weapons of mass destruction
1155553 it is all the more important because nuclear weapons are based on scottish soil against the will of the scottish people
1155554 it is wrong to say that this is a completely reserved matter
1155555 the scottish government does have powers in terms of planning and transport that are relevant in this area
1155556 indeed we intend to continue to look at ways in which we can use these powers to remove these weapons
1155557 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1155558 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1155559 all that matters is the search for madeleine kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be
1155560 theres got to be some bad in the best of us

1155565 i cant even really describe how it feels to be representing my country at the olympics
1155566 its been a long journey for me as i made the new zealand squad in 1998 i didnt quite make the cut for the sydney olympics and was one of the last two people cut for athens in 2004 that really hurt but i think it makes this moment even sweeter lately i have been looking back through the past ten years and there are so many people that i owe thanks to so many people that helped me out in some particular way i cant even begin to name them all but my three years at ub definitely helped pave my way to this moment i learned so much from all of the coaches there and the culture of family within the athletic department is something i will always fondly remember to this day i still keep track of the bulls to see how the athletes are doing

1155570 i believe she should start focusing on the mta the costs keep going up
1155571 focus on education and transportation infrastructure i think those two things will lead to a more sustainable future
1155572 i think she needs to focus on tax issues i think education particularly in new york city is very critical
1155573 probably help us get more funding from the federal government i think that its a tough economy do what she can to help the new york economy

1155591 but has been dissatisfied with the libretto because of its vast departure from voltaires original work
1155592 in 1999 british dramatist john caird prepared a significant reworking of royal national theatre songs were reordered characters more fully developed and most importantly caird returned to voltaires novel the ardens production will mark the premiere of the musical in an american regional theatre
1155593 i am extremely excited by this new version of candide it is funny insightful compelling and because john returned to voltaires original novel quite different from all previous versions

1155601 explores what happens when familiar scenarios from cartoons are divorced from their harmless context and performed naturalistically by complex human beings
1155602 is laughably simple two rivals a pumped up navy man and a heavyset bearded thug repeatedly beat each other nearly to death over the affection of a fickle skinny woman named olive however when performed realistically fists fly blood flows and this straightforward storyline transforms into a provocative look at how our society values violence the end product is brutal and harsh full of bottled up anger and regret and much closer in tone to fare
1155603 in cartoons when a man gets punched in the face his neck transforms into a spring in sailor man his nose breaks and he coughs up blood and teeth and bile
1155604 our goal is to see how audiences react when we approach this subject matter from a dramatic angle and show them something thats simultaneously real and ridiculous

1155609 democrats offered a real solution to high energy prices that would bring immediate relief within 10 days by forcing the president to free our oil from the nations stockpile
1155610 house republicans have opposed forcing oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they already control new investments in renewable energy increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards making mass transit more affordable cracking down on price gouging and releasing oil from the governments stockpile
1155611 democrats in congress are aggressively addressing the range of economic issues confronting american families and in the past few weeks alone protected homeowners from foreclosure invested in college affordability ensured women receive equal pay for equal work protected our children from toxic toys and products and made another historic investment in veterans healthcare democrats are poducing and passing real economic solutions for the american people
1155612 note the strategy of increasing sellers fees and couponing has not improved underlying metrics while recent initiatives may not be enough to carry the business in 2008
1155613 in addition foreign exchange comparisons should get more difficult in the fourth quarter of 2008
1155614 we think management is following an overly cautious game plan of incremental beats and raises resulting in tepid guidance that is insufficiently reassuring in the current macro environment
1155615 although ebay management has added on related businesses such as shopping com and stubhub and ancillary revenue generating activities such as internet advertising to maintain growth investors will likely remain unconvinced about ebays future potential until it demonstrates renewed growth in the core marketplaces business
1155616 we believe that ebay has retained its long standing advantages of very broad selection and low prices even over high performing competitors such as
1155617 there are a number of trends which will define future infrastructure ranging from high level changes in the way people do business to the applications and services that infrastructure supports to fundamental changes in the technologies that will comprise infrastructure

1155620 we feel that were doing enough and that its a global issue that isnt going away overnight
1155621 this has been a short intense five months in which perhaps some of the mourning has been diverted as we sought these changes
1155622 we realize there are going to have to be several things to reduce and eradicate domestic violence
1155623 this in and of itself will not be the total solution
1155624 we apologize for the knee jerk reaction and have issued a retraction order the affected stores are being directed to put the magazines back on sale
1155625 the parody of our newspaper ad in the august mad was very clever most of us at circuit city share a rich sense of humor and irony but there are occasional temporary lapses

1155629 shaking hands making a fist lifting things up i mean common day occurrences
1155630 and we try reconstitute the healing environment and in turn settle your pain maybe reconstitute part of the tendon
1155631 well weve done over 20 cases so far in the last year
1155632 so far 90 to 100 percent less pain more function
1155633 you know hitting the ball theres no pain to restrict you no no pain at all
1155634 if you want to you can go out and play its sunny outside and a beautiful day
1155635 i am possessed by this house and can never leave it again
1155636 social kissing has been common in certain circles in britain since the 1920s but until fairly recently it was mostly confined to relatives or close friends and to what you might call the excitable professions the theatre the media fashion anywhere you might call someone darling basically its now infinitely more widespread even accountants do it
1155637 were now starting to see the advent of non sexual lip kissing
1155638 bank manager and customer boss and employee next door neighbours client and accountant any old colleague theyre all greeting each other with a little scuffle round the cheek and lip area the rule seems to be if youve met them even once you kiss them and in business circles certainly that very definitely wasnt the case even three years ago
1155639 we kiss people we used to hug hug people we used to shake hands with and shake hands with people we used to nod to
1155640 its like these days its not unusual to hear teenagers say to their parents i love you in my day if youd said that to your mum or dad theyd have assumed they were about to be given the last rites and were becoming much more tactile theres a whole revolution in that
1155641 its about fast track bonding and empathy it also allows you to smell the other person your nose is right by the pulse behind their ear you can sniff their perfume and have a fairly good guess at what they had for lunch its a far more intimate personal instant connection
1155642 when parents kiss their children it means one thing but when they kiss each other it means something entirely different people will greet a total stranger with a kiss on the cheek and then use an identical gesture to express their most intimate feelings to a lover
1155643 kisses can be given in private or in public by men to men men to women women to women adults to children or children to each other
1155644 they can be unilateral or reciprocated they can be on the lips the cheek or any other part of the body they can be blown in the air
1155645 giving a mutual kiss when they depart from each other a custom that i never saw before nor heard of nor read in any history
1155646 i grew up at a time when if even your mother kissed you you were expected to wipe your mouth on your sleeve for decades a good firm handshake was all that was expected now all of a sudden youre expected to embrace your female colleagues daily even perhaps hug the divisional director from manchester its all become incredibly awkward and embarrassing
1155647 i feel permanently uncomfortable these days most of my friends expect a kiss which is fine i suppose quite nice in fact but at what point do you decide whether a colleague or a regular business contact or client or even a friends partner is also a friend theres a real risk of getting it wrong of offending someone whatever you decide to do i get quite nervous
1155648 the british werent even very good at the handshake and now we find ourselves having to deal with air kisses cheek kisses hugs squeezes even lip kisses its not easy the basic rule i think should be that handshakes are fine with anyone and kisses should be reserved for people you have some kind of relationship with even if its only a business lunch at which youve talked about something other than just business
1155649 really go for broke and you have to give advance warning of your intentions make what we call announcement gestures start puckering early on and raise your hands from quite a distance never kiss anyone without a torso touch by the way then theres a good chance theyll be prepared for whats coming then its basically right cheek to right cheek left cheek to left cheek and put them down where you found them
1155650 its only really man to man where theres still some reticence
1155651 many men particularly younger generations will embrace quite comfortably these days but they still kind of feel the need to accompany it with some big soprano style slap on the back to show that even though they kiss theyre still men
1155652 if you kiss at one meeting and not at the next theyre going to get entirely the wrong message
1155653 take it on the chin when you get it wrong because believe me you will

1155655 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1155656 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1155657 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1155658 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1155659 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1155660 hay toda clase de versiones pero nada que ver solamente eran vecinos

1155685 if we ever decide we want to make a change to that we recognise the importance that new zealanders place on that issue and we would never make a change to that decision without a mandate from them
1155686 i was advocating as the finance spokesman a much more radical overhaul of working for families
1155687 for the last two years bill and i have working very closely on that issue and what weve come to recognise is that it is a lot more difficult to change and i think he had a valid point
1155688 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no

1155707 with the sector teetering on the brink of financial distress investors are again asking if the recently re elected fernandez administration now has the political will and conviction to fix the system
1155708 so far the re elected government seems to be taking an approach that is likely to perpetuate the sectors instability rather than to eliminate market distortions and enforce the new electricity law
1155709 the governments decision to cap electricity prices tolerate theft by end users and give free electricity has resulted in insufficient funds for state owned electric distribution companies to cover their operating costs and pay private sector generators for contracted capacity

1155755 we have done much to promote the new rural development plan including meeting more than 200 of our members to talk through what is available under rural priorities we want to make the scheme work and have offered to assist the scottish government find ways to overcome these problems
1155756 but members frustration with the current arrangements for applying for the scheme continues we have written to cabinet secretary richard lochhead to reiterate concerns already raised with him and to point out emerging problems
1155757 i know that there have been teething problems with some people finding it difficult to apply online because for example they do not have access to a computer or a fast broadband connection i am concerned to learn of specific issues and am determined that we do all can to address them
1155758 however given the high level of interest in rural priorities there is likely to be keen competition for funding and applicants need to submit high quality proposals that will deliver significant benefits to the people of scotland
1155759 we look forward to working with nfus to ensure that we deliver and when i meet jim mclaren later this week i will be happy to again discuss this issue with him
1155760 this scheme is clearly in a complete mess the minister needs to get hold of this issue find out what has gone wrong and fix it
1155761 the snp is always happy to talk up its commitment to agriculture but it is failing scottish farmers with this scheme and the various environmental benefits it should be providing
1155762 if the continued partnership of investment in the agricultural landscapes of scotland is to reap the biodiversity and environmental benefits such measures are designed to achieve then a more pragmatic way to deal with agri environmental proposals must be found
1155763 we have seen growth over the past two years in all parts of the globe you think about the credit crunch but that isnt necessarily a global phenomenon affecting every market
1155764 we have seen tariff barriers come down in india while in china and eastern europe there is a lot more economic prosperity in terms of disposable income even in the us premium spirits are what people are choosing to drink
1155765 it is early days for this period as a high proportion of sales occur in the last seven months of the year
1155766 however things do seem to be on track at present
1155767 rising protein and energy costs will more than eliminate any benefits from recent falls in grain prices and lead to higher feed costs to maintain profit margins farm gate prices would advertisement need to increase in the case of milk to around 40p per litre this is less likely in the current post credit crunch economy which means that to maintain margins producers will have to optimise production costs and output
1155768 the signs are that sales growth is slowing sales of organic eggs have fallen with consumers migrating to cheaper free range products
1155769 the market for organic pig meat is at best holding steady with home produced supplies under pressure from imports and although sales of dairy products are increasing growth is slower than previously
1155770 from a feed perspective organic proteins have escalated significantly in price and at times been difficult to obtain last years protein bean harvest was a disaster
1155771 compounding the problem is that third world countries now realise the value of their commodities and will be looking to realise high values china has also imposed export taxes on some feed commodities further increasing costs
1155772 to be the worlds premier consumer products company focused on convenient foods and beverages we seek to produce healthy financial rewards to investors as we provide opportunities for growth and enrichment to our employees our business partners and the communities in which we operate and in everything we do we strive for honesty fairness and integrity
1155773 if we had scripted this entire event we could not have done a better job than these folks did spontaneously

1155777 we are regaining control of the virginia tech reputation and legacy and believe these messages are crucial to accomplishing that goal
1155778 we likely will live with the label virginia tech massacre or virginia tech tragedy for years to come in the media however we can use our own language in our own media to help prevent the event from defining us and may gain success in influencing history
1155779 confines the incident to specific locations within the university and doesnt allow it to completely define the university
1155780 this focuses attention on the victims and what the world has come to know about them as individuals and as a group both students and professors for their outstanding quality and contribution to the university community and society

1156095 hubo y sin negar m ritos innegables fallas muy importantes en estos cinco a os entre otras cosas no se avanz m s decididamente sobre rentas como la petrolera la minera y la financiera que permitieran una mayor y mejor redistribuci n de la riqueza y en concreto en el campo falt pol tica para los peque os y medianos productores no se dio mas extendidamente el debate con las arraigadas ideas sembradas por el neoliberalismo ni se democratizaron para facilitarlo los medios masivos de comunicaci n dominados por ellos tampoco se promovi en mayor medida desde el gobierno el imprescindible protagonismo del pueblo todo esto se manifest ahora sin lugar a dudas en la confrontaci n por la renta agraria la firmeza del gobierno no se correspondi con la conducta de una parte no menor del pj que se pas a la oposici n hemos sufrido una derrota pero no ha sido derrotado nuestro proyecto si el gobierno no acepta las presiones de los que buscan que retroceda revalorizando el peso por ejemplo y con el mismo coraje que enfrent a los grandes intereses sojeros extiende y profundiza medidas progresistas como son los aumentos de salarios la movilidad de las jubilaciones una asignaci n universal por hijo el control de los precios y una reforma impositiva que grave mas a los que mas tienen si promueve y fortalece el debate de ideas y la participaci n activa de nuestro pueblo en la transformaci n del pa s se le otorga la personer a a la cta y no cierra sobre el justicialismo su sost n pol tico sino que lo abre seriamente a otras fuerzas populares no va a poder la reacci n detener nuestra marcha hacia una argentina mejor si esas decisiones son las que se toman all estar nuestro movimiento como en estos cinco a os poniendo el hombro a esta patriada

1156097 por lo tanto el desarrollo del pa s no puede sostenerse sobre un solo sector por ejemplo no puede sostenerse s lo sobre la producci n de productos primarios tampoco hay ning n pa s desarrollado en el mundo que se asiente esencialmente en la transformaci n y renta de sus productos primarios pa ses muy ricos en petr leo cobre minerales o recursos tropicales no salen del subdesarrollo si no logran conformar una estructura diversificada compleja en nuestro caso particular la cadena agroindustrial con todo el empleo directo e indirecto que genera representa alrededor de un tercio del empleo de la fuerza de trabajo si no contamos simult neamente con una gran base industrial no vamos a poder dar trabajo y bienestar a una poblaci n de 40 millones de habitantes dicho en otros t rminos si no contamos con una estructura integrada no vamos a poder tener pleno empleo y por lo tanto nos va a sobrar al menos la mitad de la poblaci n

1156099 aqu estamos abiertos para escuchar todas las quejas ciudadanas aqu se present un problema que manifiestan pobladores de chicoapilla que el servicio de transporte uxpanapa es irregular y aparte de eso muchas veces no van entonces ellos se ven en la necesidad de transportarse en una camioneta de las denominadas piratas y les hice ver que ese tipo de camionetas no pueden circular con una concesi n dado que no cuentan con un seguro de vida no esta en regla
1156100 les propuse varias v as para solucionar el problema la principal fue de que a trav s del sub agente municipal se cheque la entrada y salida de los camiones de transporte y levantar un reporte diario en donde nos indiquen las corridas faltantes durante la semana y me compromet con ellos a ir a la ciudad de xalapa para presentarle su inconformidad pero ya con evidencia bien fundamentada ante la falta de servicio del transporte uxpanapa si ellos cumplen no habr ning n problema que escojan la ruta y no tendr n ning n problema y la famosa camioneta pirata dejara de prestar el servicio
1156101 los camiones del uxpanapa no sirven para nada nos prestan un mal servicio los ch feres te rega an se suben a los camiones con bebidas embriagantes y se llevas un bulto de 20 kilos o hasta 50 o 60 pesos esto no es posible ellos necesitan de nosotros y nosotros medios de transportes que nos brinden una mejor atenci n ya que nosotros pagamos viajes especiales ya que tenemos que salir caminando desde la ceiba hasta la autopista para abordar dichas unidades del uxpanapa ya que estos no quieren entrar a nuestras comunidades
1156102 lo que nosotros le podemos decir es que estas personas que se manifiestas es porque est n apoyando al se or salvador s nchez gonz lez quien se dedica a piratearnos el servicio quien lleva m s de tres a os haci ndolo y nosotros al mandar nuestras unidades del uxpanapa a la comunidad de chicoapilla nunca sacamos nada porque el se or siempre va adelante

1156107 turned from us to another relationship while men turned to themselves and the ground the world in many ways would be a much calmer and gentler place if women ruled there would have been far fewer children sacrificed to the gods of greed and power
1156108 but you came in the form of a man doesnt that say something
1156109 yes but not what many have assumed i came as a man to complete a wonderful picture in how we made you from the first day we hid the woman within the man so that at the right time we could remove her from within him we didnt create man to live alone she was purposed from the beginning by taking her out of him he birthed her in a sense we created a circle of relationship like our own but for humans she out of him and now all the males including me birthed through her and all originating or birthed from god
1156110 if the female had been created first there would have been no circle of relationship and thus no possibility of a fully equal face to face relationship between the male and the female right
1156111 our desire was to crate a being that had a fully equal and powerful conterpart the male and the female but your independence with its quest for power and fulfillment actually destroys the relationship your heart longs for

1156162 no and what do you mean the way you heard it my lack of desirability was a topic of discussion in the soccer locker room
1156163 the way i heard it was that the captain of the football team asked you out a senior and you blew him off what right thinking guy would attempt to ask you out after that

1156202 as such works of art are often more accurate than any other indication about the state of affairs at some remote but crucial juncture in the progress of humanity
1156203 for the command was from the lord through his prophets
1156204 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament shows forth his handiwork
1156205 then god said let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them rule over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth and god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them

1156387 any damn fool could produce a better data format than xml

1156391 almost exactly a year ago i was in some meetings where distributors were planning within five years and not speculating but planning to be out of the cd business
1156392 it felt like within five years we would be in a purely internet download world and a lot of major companies were shifting their networks to prepare for that download world and getting into the download business and now in the last couple of months ive started to hear some backpedaling on that
1156393 it may be cds are a format that may last longer than first speculated im not su re where that slowdown came from because it seemed like a year ago everybody was all prepared it was full steam ahead cds were obsolete and obviously the sam goodys and the ma and pa distributors of the world were going out of business right and left but now for some reason youre hearing that best buy and wal mart have said maybe there is some longevity to the cd format
1156394 looking beyond this initial deployment our mutual goal is to have 10 000 kiosks installed within 18 months
1156395 i never understood that goldstein said those are areas that are going to go republican but its not like the electoral college every african american voter you bring out in the panhandle offsets a cuban voter in miami likely to vote republican
1156396 today we are well capitalised if asset values dont decline we wont need any additional capital
1156397 the combination of tight financial conditions high petrol prices and low confidence is weighing heavily
1156398 the weakness in the leading index components relating to employment and new orders is concerning
1156399 in response to steadily declining new orders businesses are using existing inventories of finished goods to meet current demand for services
1156400 the latest employment sub index readings show that services firms are also re evaluating their staffing requirements in light of the economic slowdown

1156410 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1156411 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1156412 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1156413 could we just teach them our good habits and not our bad

1156434 they never gave her any of the proper medications for her aids diagnosis they did give her a prescription for a urinary tract infection but even then they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1156435 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1156436 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1156437 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor
1156438 i told her i could send her more medicine but she said they would not give it to her they were mostly giving her tylenol
1156439 he told me that victoria wasnt eating and was urinating blood but that the officials still were not paying her any mind
1156440 he told me get outside help but try not to worry
1156441 her foot was chained to the bed and when she tried to turn over it would hurt her
1156442 that made it twice as hard it was so humiliating no human should have to live their last days like that
1156443 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
1156444 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life

1156450 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
1156451 i cant understand why eddie and mick really had to discuss it
1156452 generally the footy manager deals with the disciplinary issues and the footy manager gets up and they move on because thats what happens at other clubs
1156453 but is seems that any little issue with collingwood and this is not a little issue but any issue with collingwood gets blown up a lot more than it needs to be and i think the club actually has a role in it
1156454 we are angry we are furious weve had enough the public have had enough the public have had enough of this situation
1156455 the knuckle heads who have fallen over have now got to be accountable
1156456 we can increase the revenue and value of corporate sponsorships by doing things outside the stadium
1156457 the more we talked about that the more excited they got about it
1156458 a year ago gav was a long way off playing senior football and this nomination is a credit to the hard work he has done since that time
1156459 he has been a valuable player since coming into the side and we are looking forward to his continued development
1156460 i would say weve had a losing season but theres a lot of upside at the moment
1156461 theres a great spirit down there among the players the supporters theres a real ground swell everyones on board
1156462 the decision we make will always be in the best interests of this football club going forward and not just for the short term but obviously the long term
1156463 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
1156464 this is the commencement ceremony that you should have had so many years ago and this is the opportunity for all of us to tell you publicly how sorry we are for your pain

1156467 i have a sister who is half indonesian who is married to a chinese canadian i dont know what that makes my niece
1156468 being here is especially meaningful to me because i consider myself to be an honorary aapi member and i think ive got some pretty good credentials
1156469 this is not the time for a lot of hype
1156470 its a time to actually go out and prove it
1156471 thats the name of the game i think that the expectations for this team are that they will win
1156472 otherwise you might as well you have to go into each season believing that youre going to win and winning the championship is the goal and it has to be the goal and rod absolutely believes that and believes that well contend for it
1156473 i think ultimately though it will depend on how the team is doing
1156474 if we get off to a good start and were playing exciting football the fans i think will get behind us and if we dont then then they wont
1156475 ive been frustrated with the team for several years so yes ive been extremely frustrated and disappointed not in rod but in the performance of the team but i have great faith in rod
1156476 im not getting into any kind of what ifs and end of the year thatll sort itself out at the end of the year
1156477 because football is ultimately a team game and the difference in talent between teams in the nfl is not very large
1156478 and typically at least over the years that ive seen it the teams that do well are truly well integrated teams that have been together a while and understand what theyre doing as a team and i think rod is forming that now
1156479 and thats what gives me hope is that we really have it appears all the coaches and all the players on the same page buying into rods program i believe that gives me real faith as we go into this season
1156480 we havent had that in the past weve had some talented players but they often were either selfish or didnt buy into whatever the coaching staff was espousing
1156481 i feel very good about our coach and i think ive probably made that clear because i feel good about the coach i feel good about the fact that he has the kind of players that he feels he can win with
1156482 i have no idea looking back why all that happened all the changes that he made
1156483 theres one thing that i still use that he taught me and thats it and that was just changing my grip a little bit and im sure just any coach probably would have come along and changed that a little bit just the difference between an nfl ball and one of those nike college footballs
1156484 i wanted 24 so bad it hurt my heart when i couldnt get it
1156485 too much money i was willing to pay like ten thousand and i heard rumors its going to cost like 50 im aint buying nobody no car now
1156486 hes done it for a lot of years smart high character guy im really kind of anxious to see him get his pads on and go to work
1156487 i discussed that earlier in the year and i dont want to talk about it

1156493 i think this is a very solid market for sports entertainment
1156494 lobo sports look how popular they are and the isotopes
1156495 our population base is large enough to sustain a pro hockey team
1156496 its not the game youre selling entertainment i think our focus has to be less on the game itself and more on the entertainment value make it worth their time and financial commitment
1156497 well be involved in a variety of charitable organizations economic development im proud of the rotary award the rio rancho rotary club lauded the scorpions as its business of the year for 2008
1156498 this buildings success and the communitys success will be the scorpions success

1156503 i think one of the values of the series is that it speaks not only of the depth of the female psychology but rather it speaks of the human condition no
1156504 oh comon you serious were here to celebrate this guys 40th birthday
1156505 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1156506 risks conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1156507 this is a recipe for confusion that arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1156508 the 42 day proposal has everything to do with politics and nothing at all to do with the struggle against
1156509 thats whats going to happen its a contact sport and its just part and parcel of footy i think

1156557 i think it will give more people an incentive to actually go into teaching and to pursue it because of the low pay rate a lot of people reconsider wanting to teach and wanting to go into that field because of our pay grade
1156558 i can see how teachers other teachers in other fields would feel like they are less of a teacher
1156559 if we just do bandaids like trying to pay math and science teachers more thats just a temporary fix i think south dakota needs to look at raising the base pay for all teachers
1156560 my first symptom with lupus was my hands were swollen very very swollen very stiff
1156561 it is autoimmune meaning the bodys immune system attacks its own cells and organs
1156562 there is an aspect of ultraviolet that can damage the dna in the cells and this sets off an inflammatory reaction that then causes the rash we know as the lupus rash

1156586 intel is not the first vendor to go down this road ibms power based cell processor and actually the multicore chips that ibm built for microsofts xbox and
1156587 ibms work in the multicore space effectively knocked intel out of the computer game console market
1156588 over time the consistency of intel architecture and thus developer freedom afforded by the larrabee architecture will bring about massive innovation in many areas and market segments
1156589 initial product implementations of the larrabee architecture will target discrete graphics applications support directx and opengl and run existing games and programs
1156590 additionally a broad potential range of highly parallel applications including scientific and engineering software will benefit from the larrabee native c c programming model
1156591 that said the type of rendering capabilities this would offer in a standard pc would also probably have repercussions in other type of pc graphics including video editing
1156592 pcs due to the sheer muscle of their processes offer a much higher level of sophistication than the dedicated game console boxes

1156596 thats when he asked me if i wanted to play on the empire state games team
1156597 at first i didnt really know about the empire games at all the coach just came up to me during the semifinal game
1156598 when i bring staff in here they already know the expectations they dont have to be trained because they were trained with the fitness team before they got here theres already a respect there and i know what i have when i bring on someone from the fitness team
1156599 its rewarding to me that the kids want to come back and do something with me it definitely makes it a family atmosphere
1156600 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1156601 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1156602 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1156603 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1156604 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1156605 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1156613 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1156614 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1156615 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price

1156622 we couldnt be happier that lauren made the decision to return and continue her collegiate career
1156623 she will likely not compete on bars because of previous injuries but her addition will give us another rock solid competitor on three events
1156624 shakea is an exceptional vaulter and also very skilled on beam and floor
1156625 with coaching and experience on bars she could eventually be a solid all arounder

1156658 the public is really sick of politics as usual in washington
1156659 suggests usda has problems tracking and ensuring the health of cattle imported from canada
1156660 nmpf believes that the bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease situation in canada is such that an animal could be imported into the u s and if allowed to reside amongst the u s dairy herd introduce or disseminate bse in the u s this is evident by the number of cases of bse from animals born after the usda determined date of effective enforcement of their feed ban
1156661 we request that usda close the canadian border to the importation of cattle for breeding or herd replacement purposes until such time that usda can sufficiently ensure the health of imported cattle and your ability to track these cattle
1156662 the enforcement of the 1997 canadian feed ban does not appear to be effective in preventing the spread of bse in canada
1156663 cattle imported for breeding or herd replacement purposes may not show clinical symptoms of bse infection for many years allowing bse to incubate in u s cattle herds in addition any offspring from these cattle will also reside in the u s cattle population if any of these animals are confirmed positive for bse both domestic and export markets for u s producers will be disrupted
1156664 none of what they do is going to stop us from delivering our message
1156665 there is evidence that hatred of our religion was the motivation in part at least

1156689 let me be blunt with you if you dont do this you will lose the election its just that simple
1156690 dr dobson would gladly open his door to either candidate for a discussion of issues vital to the family
1156691 always understood dr dobsons role and influence to be far larger
1156692 many moms listen to his show as they car pool their kids around or run errands
1156693 they trust him on issues of childrearing and want to hear his opinion on other issues as well
1156694 its a deposit of trust built up over 30 years
1156695 too many members of the media right center and left dont understand who lives in this country and if you get that part wrong your analysis will be off

1156700 my dads been sick so im trying to help my parents out been really hard
1156701 we have probably 100 more people at least than we did last year and its because of the economy and people being laid off and people trying to get something to tie them over till they get a job
1156702 the reports projections assume that the inherent nature of male male and female female relationships is the same as male female and that they will respond similarly to legal recognition
1156703 but it seems unlikely when science tells us that male and female are unique even at the cellular level
1156704 marriage traditionally celebrates the differences between male and female and gives a mother and father to children there will be little to celebrate however if marriage is reduced to nothing more than benefits for two consenting adults
1156705 the vehicles purchased by the plaintiff and the other class members were not as unique or rare as the defendants had stated them to be
1156706 their value from scarcity and as collectors items were and are dramatically less than the buyers had been led to believe their value would be
1156707 people were saying the turning point of the season was in toronto when
1156708 in retrospect obviously the tire was obviously not good enough
1156709 there have been times this year when the tire hasnt been what we wanted we all remember and of course indy but i think they also deserve some credit this car is a completely different animal and for the most part this year tires havent been by far for the most part the issue it certainly wasnt what anybody wanted it wasnt what goodyear wanted
1156710 when they do that whats going to happen is the complaints are going to start coming about the grip level of the tire
1156711 thats what we had at thats what we had at atlanta the last race at atlanta where everybody complained so loudly about the tire was the first time we havent had a tire problem at atlanta in a long time if you ask me if theyre going to err id rather they err on the side of the car driving bad then erring on the side of wearing them out
1156712 the technology that goodyear has access to and the technology that goodyear needs to develop needs to be more concentrated in my opinion on what they can do from a simulation standpoint from an away from the race track standpoint because you can get so much more done there
1156713 the test procedure that they have im not opposed to because ive seen it work
1156714 but when you have a test and they bring three or four sets of tires thats really all you have to pick from if none of those work then you dont have a solution so finding a way to build the tires correctly before they ever come to a test to me thats where the technology needs to be invested and thats more important than the actual testing itself as seen by me
1156715 i think multiple tires the negatives far outweigh the positives i believe that for racing to be as good as it can be that every team should have access to the same tire i dont think having different tires i dont think in any form or fashion does that make the racing better if the race turns into a battle of tires how does that make better racing i dont think it does at all
1156716 burton despite tire issues nascar shouldnt have more tire manufacturers
1156717 i disconnected my oil tank last week so if it doesnt were going to freeze this winter
1156718 our oil bills were 95 a month and rising and i was beginning to worry about how we were going to cope in the future
1156719 ive worked out that even if fuel prices stay the same the heat pump will have paid for itself in five years and the panels in under 10 its too early to see how much money were making from them but on a sunny day our electricity meter goes backwards its a wonderful sight
1156720 we considered a ground source heat pump where warmth is extracted from the earth and converted into heating but our garden was just too small for the piping required
1156721 when we investigated the possibility of an air source heat pump we were amazed to discover that they are very popular in scandinavia and they can work at very low temperatures
1156722 i had my first wash in renewable energy hot water this morning
1156723 ill just have to remember not to plant any succulents by it
1156724 weve got rid of the old boiler and given it to a neighbour the local farmer is taking the oil tank and someone else is buying the oil
1156725 well still need grid electricity during the winter but all our heating and hot water is now from renewable energy

1156856 when i reached him he was unable to do anything he was horizontal in the water and he appeared to have given up his head was below the surface and he was in a bad way
1156857 i reached out to him and supported his head above the water instinctively he tried to grab me which although a natural reaction for him made things very difficult
1156858 i took hold of him and tried to re assure him he was too tired and cold to move his legs to help himself so i just had to swim back to shore with him he kept saying that i had saved his life but i told him that we still had to get back to shore
1156859 it was a pretty difficult rescue partly because of the distance they were from the hq and partly because how far out they were had it not been for the quad bike i do not think i would have been able to get to the man in time
1156860 both jason and rosie did extremely well the council provides lifeguard cover at ryde ventnor and in sandown bay precisely for incidents like this but we should not forget that a rescue of this nature requires a tremendous amount of skill and determination
1156861 jason did tremendously well there is no doubt in my mind that his actions saved the mans life

1156910 it is no surprise that the police breaks journalists cameras and silences protesters as a matter of routine
1156911 this is the result of a forgiving attitude of senior police officials with regard to other similar incidents involving police officers
1156912 at this time when serious questions have arisen about our link to the land of israel and our right to live here there is special meaning to prayers at rachels tomb for our children to return home
1156913 the state is lying to the media to the general public and to the courts when it claims that it supports pollard and his wife in various ways and supports them financially
1156914 the states lie is thwarting the public struggle for his release because if the courts believe that the state is helping him financially it is seen as doing everything in its ability to secure his release
1156915 out of concern that it would harm the wellbeing of pollard and the efforts of the state of israel to help him
1156916 the state is throwing sand in the face of the public and steadfastly lying to the wider public and the courts
1156917 the state is not allowed to fool the public into thinking that it is doing something for pollard
1156918 if israel has given even a shekel to pollard or his wife then it should prove it
1156919 we know the truth it will come out in court
1156920 the fact is that were police forces there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when they the hikers came to them the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation they bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
1156921 if the police were there and watched the confrontation what was the problem of the police to stand openly and prevent them the hikers from passing and if it was not permitted to stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush somebody hides out like thieves in the night
1156922 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
1156923 you agree that special police forces were in the area at that time
1156924 they wore a police hat and they shouted that they are police and identified themselves as police some were in a hiding place and some waited on alert
1156925 all of sudden policemen disguised as civilians but with police hats suddenly came out from behind a small hill and arrested the person who shot in the air and some of the armed escorts
1156926 that must be the only place such data is stored
1156927 your brother you shall serve yet it shall be that when you are aggrieved you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck
1156928 if israel ever transgresses torah and is thus underserving of dominion you will have a right to be aggrieved that he has taken your blessing and you may cast off his yoke from your neck
1156929 this is in consonance with the prophecy given to rifka while she was pregnant her two sons would not be able to coexist when one ascended the other would decline
1156930 concern that the prime minister would easily give up too much israeli land
1156931 take a census of the whole israelite community by their clans and families listing every man by name one by one

1156953 i dont think that the fed can really pull any of its levers to create a short term fix
1156954 to go higher i think we need the sentiment to change with lower energy prices crude oil dropping below the 117 area certainly would provide a very visible benefit in terms of the economy but it also makes the problems seems a little bit less severe
1156955 were kind of going through a period of healing and trying to maybe etch out some kind of bottom
1156956 a lot of times you just dont reach a bottom and go straight up
1156957 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
1156958 pete you only need 78 hits to break the record how many at bats do you think youll need to get the 78 hits
1156959 ah come on pete you dont expect to get 78 hits in 78 at bats do you
1156960 every time i step up to the plate i expect to get a hit if i dont expect to get a hit i have no right to step in the batters box in the first place
1156961 then i probably dont have a prayer to get a hit it is a positive expectation that has gotten me all of the hits in the first place
1156962 if i am to keep my eyes on the prize and press on what does it mean for me
1156963 if god is for us who can be against us
1156964 who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens who has held the dust of the earth in a basket or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance
1156965 whom did the lord consult to enlighten him and who taught him the right way who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding
1156966 surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket they are regarded as dust on the scales he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust
1156967 before him all the nations are as nothing they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing
1156968 lift your eyes and look to the heavens who created all these he who brings out the starry host one by one and calls them each by name because of his great power and mighty strength not one of them is missing
1156969 he sits enthroned above the circle of the earth and its people are like grasshoppers he stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in he brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing no sooner are they planted no sooner are they sown no sooner do they take root in the ground than he blows on them and they wither and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff
1156970 and if anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire
1156971 one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples so he said to them when you pray say
1156972 but woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves nor do you allow those who are entering to go in
1156973 theyre trying to take my house away for a parking violation
1156974 i know it was my own fault for letting it drag on ive been under mental duress i havent been able to handle this
1156975 but on the other hand the city has to enforce its zoning laws i dont fault the city for that
1156976 its a shame someone didnt intervene to help him it would be nice if someone who worked for government would take the time and say lets look at this and see if were doing the right thing it would be nice if they would remember the human factor here
1156977 it was a combination of things financial and emotional my caregiving role all heaped themselves on me at the wrong time
1156978 one day in a very bad mood mom told me to get rid of the cars in the driveway right away
1156979 if someone says im dealing with a death were going to be reasonable and give them a 30 day extension
1156980 but 1 475 thats a lot of months mourning not to be insensitive
1156981 if youre telling me we had a mentally anguished individual and that inspectors made no attempts to get at that that can be considered
1156982 there will have to be some serious evidence but if we were deaf to that point i would be willing to reconsider some of those fees
1156983 theres really not too much that would allow us to reverse those charges
1156984 if you were a criminal wed take care of the whole problem for you get you an attorney

1156988 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was sen obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election

1156994 the builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two storey suburban villa with pitched roofs end gables front porch picture windows chimneys and so forth
1156995 there is usually nothing about the ecohouse to signal that it is a new kind of energy efficient machine for living in
1156996 the slate in the roof may be recycled but with so many solar panels skylights sun tunnels and windows in it and on it theres no good reason for it being made of slate at all

1156999 when the owners realized that their hope of making money was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities

1157001 we believed god called us to macedonia and now here we are in prison why did god allow this to happen
1157002 chuck ive come to the place where i believe only on very rare occasions does god tell us why so ive decided to stop asking
1157003 why is god silent when the world is being turned upside down doesnt god care about our suffering and injustices

1157009 how does jesus the christ take away the sting of death
1157010 21 isaac prayed to the lord on behalf of his wife because she was barren the lord answered his prayer and his wife rebekah became pregnant

1157261 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
1157262 she wont file a formal request to the convention asking to be nominated along with barack obama who eked out the victory in their fierce primary slugfest
1157263 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states and realizes there are passionate feelings that remain among many of her supporters
1157264 they will be made collaboratively with senator clinton and her staff the dnc and senator obamas campaign

1157272 rootley you are young and nimble brother alfonso you are vast and so physically imposing that you could probably club them into submission with your willy and i am trained in all sorts of fisticuffs and wear the shield of righteousness about me they are armed with nothing more terrifying than cudgels i say we fight them

1157282 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
1157283 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
1157284 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
1157285 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
1157286 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
1157287 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
1157288 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
1157289 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
1157290 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
1157291 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
1157292 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1157293 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1157294 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1157295 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1157296 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1157297 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1157298 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1157299 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1157300 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1157301 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1157302 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1157303 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1157304 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1157305 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1157306 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1157307 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1157308 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1157309 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
1157310 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
1157311 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
1157312 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
1157313 ik ben gelukkig in de liefde dus met het spel wordt het toch niets
1157314 pharmaceuticals travel easy by bike not particularly large or bulky
1157315 we are able to help them reduce their carbon footprint
1157316 there are more and more cars on the road everyday creating more and more greenhouse emissions
1157317 medicine and drugs are actually leeching into the water supply through the landfills and there hasnt been a proper disposal of medications so id like to change that
1157318 that consist of actually changing policy and changing law which is a long process
1157319 we could hire a service that could actually destroy them properly
1157320 dedicated to bringing the best available clustering technology to java
1157321 visualvm and terracotta are a natural fit visualvm provides in depth analysis of the virtual machine and terracotta provides key information on cross cluster issues
1157322 terracotta is making a considerable investment in tools that will ease the transition from single servers or small clusters to larger clusters
1157323 leveraging the sun visualvm technology will allow us to achieve this objective more rapidly
1157324 complementary technologies that can provide unique visibility across the application tier
1157325 together they help accelerate and simplify the building testing tuning and operation of their java software

1157327 rapidly and cost effectively developed into business processes as needed
1157328 ve narrows the construction activity to the creation of the abstract design focusing primarily on the application logic and relieving the development team from focusing on implementation details consequently ve reduces the number of required skill sets and the overall team size
1157329 but we will quickly follow it with other target architectures based on market demand
1157330 its because we didnt over feast in the good times that we now have no famine in tougher times
1157331 you can see a definite pickup of impairments more of that will come through in the second half but it is difficult to know what impact that will have
1157332 the builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two storey suburban villa with pitched roofs end gables front porch picture windows chimneys and so forth
1157333 there is usually nothing about the ecohouse to signal that it is a new kind of energy efficient machine for living in
1157334 the slate in the roof may be recycled but with so many solar panels skylights sun tunnels and windows in it and on it theres no good reason for it being made of slate at all
1157335 ho conosciuto in chat questo ragazzo era il ragazzo pi figo che avevo mai trovato in vita mia parlavamo del pi e del meno e ci divertivamo tantissimo conoscendomi sapevo che il giorno che ci saremmo incontrati la nostra cyberamicizia sarebbe finita e non sarebbe stata pi la stessa cosa perch sarebbe sparito tutto il divertimento e tutto il mistero che c nel chattare con una persona che non si mai vista va be forse solo in foto e di cui non si conosce solo il tono della voce ma visto che insisteva abbiamo deciso di scambiare i nostri numeri di telefono appena ha avuto il mio numero mi ha chiamato la sua voce mi sembrata orribile ma ormai era arrivata lora di vederci e incontrare quella persona meravigliosa che avevo conosciuto nella chat quando lho visto mi sembrato un tipo troppo comune e aveva dei modi pessimi per mia disgrazia ci eravamo dati appuntamento per pranzo lui ha mangiato come un maiale quella sera lui mi ha telefonato ma non ho risposto e continuai cos in tutte le sue chiamate successive bloccandolo anche nel messenger e nella posta elettronica desidererei non averlo mai incontrato di persona forse ora staremo ancora chattando e raccontandoci storie incredibili e trascorrendo momenti felici nel mondo virtuale
1157336 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time

1157338 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it

1157341 will certainly discuss the free trade agreement and their strategies for getting it through their respective legislatures
1157342 and of course theyll discuss the visa waiver program that the south koreans are very interested in having with the united states
1157343 we have a voluntary agreement between our beef exporters and korean beef importers
1157344 we certainly are in close contact with the north koreans about what they need to do we are hopeful that we will be able to reach an understanding with the north koreans but were not at that juncture yet
1157345 it is up to the north koreans now to come back to us and accept a verification protocol
1157346 you have no idea what kind of day im having
1157347 i think abortions should be given out freely to parents who would be unfit to raise the children
1157348 oh its only 8 weeks old it has no brain its not a human life
1157349 the embryo is attached to my body and it cant live without me therefore it is part of my body and therefore i can cut it off the same way i can cut off a mole on my upper lip which is also living human cells that cant live on their own
1157350 the lord has established his throne in the heavens and his kingdom rules over all
1157351 decisions not yet made do not exist anywhere to be known even by god they are potential yet to be realized but not yet actual god can predict a great deal of what we will choose to do but not all of it because some of it remains hidden in the mystery of human freedom the god of the bible displays an openness to the future that the traditional view of omniscience simply cannot accommodate
1157352 the conception of deity which prevails most widely today even among those who profess to give heed to the scriptures is a miserable caricature a blasphemous travesty of the truth the god of the twentieth century is a helpless effeminate being who commands the respect of no really thoughtful man the god of the popular mind is the creation of a maudlin sentimentality the god of many a present day pulpit is an object of pity rather than of awe inspiring reverence
1157353 he is the only being existent in this world the reason for whose existence is in himself
1157354 our god is in the heavens he does all that he pleases
1157355 god reigns over the nations god sits on his holy throne
1157356 the almighty has his own purposes woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh
1157357 the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether
1157358 i do not intend to spend any time at all proving to you the general truth that god is sovereign in his world there is no need for i know that if you are a christian you believe this already how do i know that because i know that if you are a christian you pray and the recognition of gods sovereignty is the basis of your prayers in prayer you ask for things and give thanks for things why because you recognize that god is the author and source of all the good that you have had already and all the good that you hope for in the future this is the fundamental philosophy of christian prayer the prayer of a christian is not an attempt to force gods hand but a humble acknowledgement of helplessness and dependence when we are on our knees we know that it is not we who control the world it is not in our power therefore to supply our needs by our own independent efforts every good thing that we desire for ourselves and for others must be sought from god and will come if it comes at all as a gift from his hands in effect therefore what we do every time we pray is to confess our own impotence and gods sovereignty the very fact that a christian prays is thus proof positive that he believes in the lordship of his god
1157359 alles wijst erop dat dit de laatste rustplaats van cleopatra is

1157373 prenatal screening should not be used as a means to abortion but rather to help parents be prepared to welcome a disabled child
1157374 by providing a patriotic and contemplative context for the minute of silence the law plainly serves secular rather than religious purposes
1157375 the purposes of these exercises is plain to foster patriotism and provide an opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful contemplation
1157376 the argument that somehow they needed a new statute to encourage thoughtful contemplation among students is simply not true
1157377 legislators repeatedly emphasized that students could stare at their shoes think about upcoming exams think about their pets engage in other nonverbal activities during the moment of silence as well as pray if they wished
1157378 increasing political and legal battles over local taxes indicate that we may be nearing a climactic point in our seemingly endless political debate over what we want from government and how much were willing to pay for it
1157379 no matter if that device is a laptop or a handheld it has to go through some sort of scanning process to find if they have all the requisite materials before you allow them to access the network its clear that didnt happen here
1157380 update now the democratic leadership has shut off lights of the house as gop members are speaking on the floor debating how we lower gas prices
1157381 we are speaking without microphones as though it were 1908 acoustics of house chamber are good and gallery and you can hear us
1157382 i just told the house chamber we the people can take back the capitol with these new media tools by networking and shining sunlight everywhere
1157383 one of the great advantages of politicking online is the ability to control delivery technologies
1157384 when the house republicans wanted to tell citizens that the democrats wouldnt allow a vote on their energy bill they went after young voters with messages on such short message systems as twitter and qik as well as the by now tried and true youtube more mature voters in their base were sought out through such websites as republican senate gov and an array of conservative blogs the scene was dramatic with all of this action occurring after the house closed for its august recess on friday night
1157385 last friday they decided that they could get more legs for their story on the web
1157386 our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy despite having been paid in full by our company
1157387 funny they dont name them as would be normal in a case like this also i was told that beijingticketing com was getting their tickets directly from olympic sponsors if i had been told i was dealing with a third party i would have been a lot less comfortable
1157388 i think scott said that because the heat is now on him
1157389 now he can pretend that he never got the tickets that everyone is going to receive a refund on their credit cards so everything is fine and dandy
1157390 totally disbelieves the e mail it didnt make sense to me that they would be using a ticket broker themselves if thats the case then let us see the money transfers the total sums of money along with the charges each time they ordered tickets
1157391 numerous complaints of consumers paying thousands of dollars for tickets theyve never received
1157392 defrauded and will continue to defraud consumers in california and throughout the u s

1157394 if i try to sell t shirts with the olympic rings on them the usoc would have the police knocking on my door at 3 a m with a cease and desist order
1157395 the ioc usoc and beijing organizing committee had to know about this scam six months ago
1157396 so why didnt they send out a press release warning consumers that youre get scammed because these people cant deliver tickets
1157397 yup we should all watch out for the administration moves to revive term extension via amendments to the constitution malacanang is exploiting the peace process in mindanao as its key to unlock charter change

1157402 the rights of muslim women in the quran theory and practice
1157403 the quran has innumerable verses in favour of women but men sometimes misinterpret verses related to polygamy and hijab to suit their whims and fancies
1157404 with no access to education most rural muslim women have no idea about the courts and the laws and even what the quran says about womens rights the need of the hour is to take up these cases and help women get their due rights they become easy victims and run from pillar to post when men desert them dump triple talaq on them and irresponsibly use polygamy as their birthright

1157417 if the state is going to tighten its budget maybe the local governments will have to do the same thing
1157418 every branch of government ought to be looking at ways they can cut back
1157419 for a republican caucus that fancies itself as being tax cutters this is a hard decision to make but there are no good choices when youre 1 6 billion down
1157420 to come back now and say we dont have the money is awkward to say the least at this point we dont have a strategy
1157421 they just dont have the money to make up this shortfall
1157422 local governments are really having a hard time when youre talking about cutting budgets youre talking about cutting services

1157457 proponents of open source software continue efforts to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products
1157458 sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may decline
1157459 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperature and other weather conditions from those records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
1157460 speaking for zanu pf his party and myself we are committed and want to see the speedy and successful conclusion of the talks so that we can focus on the turnaround of our economy
1157461 now that tsvangirai has a new passport he will have to resist the tempting idea of leaving the country to launch a government in exile which for the british is a precursor to insurgency here and more forays into the security council
1157462 it will be a ruinous route to follow one which would bring personal grief to tsvangirai after monday his best chances are with president mugabe
1157463 i think theyre a bunch of idiots i dont think i like big brother anymore theyve annoyed me im fuming
1157464 no theres nothing wrong with them at all theyre perfect
1157465 then i started to add up how much money i had spent on someone i didnt even like
1157466 we have viewed a copy of the press ad and considered you sic objections but do not feel it have sic breached our codes on the basis you suggest
1157467 marketing communications addressed to targeted at or featuring children should contain nothing that is likely to result in their physical mental or moral harm
1157468 marketing communications addressed to or targeted at children a should not actively encourage them to make a nuisance of themselves to parents or others and should not undermine parental authority
1157469 the use of extravagant language should be avoided as should bogus and confusing scientific terms if it is necessary to use a scientific expression its meaning should be clear
1157470 i dont apologise if a bit of pester power goes home with the kids but i dont see george orwell looming round the corner
1157471 encourage them children to make a nuisance of themselves to parents or others
1157472 seems to be just an educational way to engage children in this topical issue
1157473 we do not believe that an rs dvr customer is sufficiently distinguishable from a vcr user to impose liability as a direct infringer on a different party for copies that are made automatically upon that customers command
1157474 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1157475 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1157476 this decision is a great victory for innovation technological progress and consumers rights
1157477 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1157478 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1157479 being selected as a ppc in a target seat is like making it through the foothills getting elected is a whole new story
1157480 i asked barack obama what he wanted for his birthday
1157481 as a white sox fan this hurts a little bit
1157482 i lost track of the number of times gordon said the joker wanted us to do this

1157488 the three flights we conducted last week have shown the world what the future of racing and entertainment will look like we are looking forward to the next step of conducting our first exhibition races and displaying the amazing 3d racetrack in the sky technology
1157489 these flights would not have happened without the amazingly hard working team here at rocket racing league
1157490 working with the development teams at xcor and velocity aircraft as well as the logistics folks at eaa the flights went off without a hitch and the rocket racer performed exactly as planned
1157491 when they floated that proposal we decided there was no point in proceeding with the talks
1157492 it would be handing over power on a silver platter there are zanu people seriously opposed to such an arrangement these are not mickey mouse characters
1157493 accepting a non executive vice presidency would be very similar to the position given to joshua nkomo after the peace accord was signed in 1987 many ndebele people still believe that his acceptance of the post was short sighted and that even in the face of the gukurahundi he should have held out for more authority care must be taken by tsvangirai and the mdc as they must ensure that whatever they do accept it does not lower their expectations and the need they have to fulfill the peoples mandate i guess we knew zanu pf was not serious and we have never expected anything from south african president thabo mbeki
1157494 as i have said before these talks will achieve nothing and i see them as a hiding to nothing why did some of us believe mbeki he will protect mugabe to the end s leaders have agreed to end political violence peta thornycroft reports for voa that violence continues there is a news blackout on negotiations between the only statements about the negotiations have come from zanu pf which lost its parliamentary majority to the mdc in the march 29 elections according to the statements published in the state media the negotiations will not lead to mdc rule
1157495 it doesnt appear to us to be the actions of someone who is about to take their own life
1157496 this has been a short intense five months in which perhaps some of the mourning has been diverted as we sought these changes
1157497 we realize there are going to have to be several things to reduce and eradicate domestic violence
1157498 this in and of itself will not be the total solution
1157499 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1157500 the only thing ive heard him say is that we should inflate our tires
1157501 so he has no plan for addressing the energy challenges that we face
1157502 morgan has a broken arm elbow and has minor shoulder damage but was in good spirits when i spoke with him a short time ago at the elvis presley memorial trauma center at the med a level 1 trauma center at the regional medical center at memphis he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery

1157586 western fast food chains have only penetrated the urban areas for now but obesity is an issue even in rural areas
1157587 in the long run i believe obesity will become a bigger problem even in china because of the westernization of our lifestyle meaning the reduction in physical activity
1157588 we dont exercise as much and there is much less physical activity in our daily life things like we dont ride our bicycle we dont walk as much and the change in the diet
1157589 china right now is experiencing an awakening demand for fitness because of the organization and growing growth
1157590 olympics is a great force to change peoples health and fitness consciousness the government is spending to promote health lifestyle im very optimistic about the change but its going to be a slow change
1157591 todays households think having a healthy body is more important for their kids because health is the base of everything
1157592 its more important than studying because if you have a healthy body youre be able to study better some students say their parents even encourage them to exercise more they encourage me to be healthy to exercise more i was not athletic before but as ive grown up i enjoy sports more
1157593 olympics will bring us more culture give us a better chance to communicate with and understand other cultures international communication respect and understanding four elements we are trying to promote because china needs it

1157606 choice programs will not be implemented easily or even cheaply the surest way to help guarantee their success will be conscious well thought out strategies drawing on the best thinking of the worlds of government and philanthropy and perhaps the surest way to encourage their failure is to implement choice programs quickly carelessly and cheaply optimistic that at some point things will all work out for the best

1157614 i dont think the city understands how difficult it is to do a project like this without their support
1157615 if they view their responsibility to work this hard to pull this project rather than helping expedite it then it will never be done

1157627 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalization of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity

1157707 whatever side of the abortion debate you are on many canadians from all walks of life felt this appointment went way too far and offended too many
1157708 the mass media coverage of the morgentaler award has given us the largest abortion debate this country has seen in twenty years and canadians when they are forced to think about abortion realize it is horrible
1157709 clearly the waves of offended canadians speaking out have had an impact
1157710 when a former lieutenant governor speaks out and returns his snowflake disavowing himself from the order undoubtedly that is going to have an effect
1157711 do you believe abortionist henry morgentaler deserves the order of canada press 1 for yes press 2 for no

1157721 we may be hard wired to treat fairness as a reward
1157722 receiving a fair offer activates the same brain circuitry as when we eat craved food win money or see a beautiful face
1157723 fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats
1157724 in both cases they were being offered the same amount of money but in one case its fair and in the other case its not
1157725 the brains reward regions were more active when people were given a 5 offer out of 10 than when they received a 5 offer out of 23
1157726 we call this finding the sunny side of fairness because it shows the rewarding experience of being treated fairly
1157727 were showing what happens in the brain when people swallow their pride
1157728 the region of the brain most associated with self control gets activated and the disgust related region shows less of a response
1157729 if we can regulate our sense of insult we can say yes to the insulting offer and accept the cash
1157730 apparently taking economics courses can to overcome the fairness hard wiring
1157731 that in canada they get better health care for less money
1157732 if that were true id have already moved to canada

1157735 increasing returns to scale combined with money makes money are all you need for inequality
1157736 before you start messing with the financial system and its problems
1157737 software is costly make very cheap to copy same with industrial design finance is not the only reason for increasing returns to scale
1157738 leverage doesnt make money it just increases both risk and reward
1157739 but someone with 10 million in financial assets never needs to work any more
1157740 if holding great wealth is not made more costly inequality will continue to increase has no one ever played monopoly
1157741 no winslow i dont buy this one problem swamps all others view
1157742 and international finance with the assymmetric pressures on deficit countries and surplus countries is another still bigger disaster because of the distorting effects it has the terms of trade
1157743 and no im not a fan of leverage for everyone i would like to see less of it full stop

1157780 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1157781 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1157795 mmmmmmmm anderson hes dreamy just dreamy ive been a fan of his since season 1 of the mole i just thought he was so cool when he talked in this cool low secret agent voice if you can accomplish this task listen no one can tell anyone how big their steps should be or when they can take them you can take issue with someone making overtly denying statements and you can take issue with people straight up presenting themselves as someone that theyre not because i think thats kind of shady and not very stand up but you cant fault someone for going through the process at their own time you cant but again to speak to the public nature of things it is in our capacity to respect the job descriptions that people have separate from the life that they live and i dont care about the person on the news i literally tune in to hear the news i might find them dreamy but i dont really need to know much more about them
1157796 i really deeply feel like im in love with this person there are people who feel the same thing and those models are normal

1157799 we demand the academic freedom to gain knowledge and a society that doesnt allow scientists to do that has got a problem
1157800 the people who are responsible for the recent vandalism are acting criminally aside from impairing scientific research and damaging property they are now putting innocent people at risk

1157834 wir m ssen dieses und jenes tun um diesen konflikt
1157835 es evidente que la intenci n de uribe es retirarle a la instituci n que m s ha hecho por descubrir y confrontar la influencia paramilitar en el congreso la facultad de investigar a congresistas
1157836 esta propuesta no tiene un prop sito distinto que el de ayudar a los miembros de la coalici n de uribe a librarse de la justicia
1157837 no es claro con respecto a qui n estar a cargo de las investigaciones si los fiscales de la fiscal a general de la naci n o los jueces del tribunal de bogot
1157838 haciendo acusaciones cuestionables e incluso llamando a los magistrados por tel fono para indagar acerca de investigaciones en curso
1157839 no ser a necesario retirarle a la corte suprema la competencia sobre las investigaciones a congresistas
1157840 esta invocaci n orwelliana del debido proceso que hace el gobierno pareciera apuntar principalmente a encubrir su intenci n de darles un golpe fatal a las investigaciones de la parapol tica

1157846 this was a true community project and something that seemed like a natural one for rotary to be involved in
1157847 this room has been designed for community use and to be open to everyone free of charge even when the library is closed
1157848 this new room has been constructed in the spirit of rotary and is a fitting project to mark the centennial of rotary international
1157849 both of our clubs are proud to represent rotary in our support of the project
1157850 we tried to anticipate as many uses for the room as we could think of
1157851 the renovation and rebuilding of the oswego library would not have been possible without the support of so many organizations
1157852 the joint support of the two local rotary clubs helped make the community room a reality and we appreciate the support we had from them early on
1157853 there has been a need for more of this type of space in the community for some time
1157854 to provide it in a historically renovated building such as the library is a wonderful addition to oswego
1157855 gt oswego witnessed 13 waterspouts at noon saturday over lake ontario bill gregway local weather observer said they occur when cold air blows over warm water and are common in october this photo was taken from the cemetery at fort ontario
1157856 the waterspouts were spawned by a brief thunderstorm that was occurring at the same time

1157858 it was dry but nice and then the last third of the month there was a lot of rain clouds and humidity
1157859 the reason for the humidity this month is because the jet stream hasnt been pushing up into canada

1157872 the administration has shown time and again that when it comes to this program they are willing to run roughshod over congress and the american public

1157874 daimler trucks north america which manufactures freightliner sterling and western star trucks has selected the ultrashift hv so that they could offer their customers the fuel saving features of an automated transmission
1157875 their familiarity and success with other roadranger products and the people who represent those products were also contributing factors
1157876 the ultrashift transmission is without question the most efficient cost effective way for medium duty customers to improve fuel economy
1157877 not only is the transmission more efficient than comparable automatics it can be serviced in most cases by the selling dealer instead of a local distributor customers experiencing transmission problems will no longer need to guess between a distributor and a dealer in some cases what was thought to be a transmission problem can actually be a truck problem when that happens someone has to get the truck where it needs to be and its usually the customer these reasons alone make the eaton ultrashift transmission a strong consideration

1157879 its a little girl in freedom park getting her face painted while the camera is focusing on the child on her face on her body and then follows her through the crowd at freedom park

1157901 advances and innovation in cybersecurity strategies tactics and technologies dictate that thought leaders work together and drive a meeting of the minds to ensure that the multi dimensional nature of the threats and solutions are discussed in a global and multi disciplined way
1157902 the participants in the defense in dimension roundtable bring a wealth of diversity and depth of experience and perspective to the discussion
1157903 in working with both the supply and demand side of cybersecurity i see the roundtable as a real source of best thinking and i look forward to my role in the roundtable to center the discussion on closing the gap between the arsenal of cybersecurity tools available to the organizations echelon one works with and the pressing operational and governance needs they have
1157904 the defense in dimension roundtables focused dialogue and collective thinking gives organizations a view on how to move from their defensive cybersecurity postures to adaptive proactive and preemptive security postures and will be particularly beneficial for mita groups clients in the us federal government community
1157905 most notable from the roundtable discussion was its unanimity on the need to focus on the measures that matter and the multidimensional need to balance operational capabilities with governance and performance management capabilities

1157925 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

1157930 we will pay close attention to it but we must not reify the agreement points in it into laws and we should resist interpretations that seek to employ those agreements as laws
1157931 resist the temptation of those who will try to turn this descriptive document into a proscriptive edict
1157932 to break the cycle of being bullied into bigotry and distracted from mission and ministry by those who would exclude us because of our commitment to the full inclusion of all the baptized in the body of christ
1157933 we look forward to general convention 2009 and the opportunities we will have there to move the church further forward on the journey toward full inclusion
1157934 we remind our bishops that we cannot live up to our baptismal vows to respect the dignity of every human being if we tell some of them that they are good enough to arrange our flowers play our organs direct our choirs teach our sunday schools and lead our worship but not good enough to have their vocations affirmed and their relationships blessed

1157969 by hearing from so many different groups in a public drafting process we have been able to write a license that successfully addresses a broad spectrum of concerns but even more importantly these different groups have had an opportunity to find common ground on important issues facing the free software community today such as patents tivoization and treacherous computing

1157978 for a person to come into my workplace and insult and judge me in such a manner without him knowing anything about me is absurd
1157979 what frustrates me most about this whole scenario is the fact that both customers and employees alike had to witness something so hateful towards those of middle eastern descent at one of the most difficult times to be of a visible minority for arab and muslim people it was completely unjust for him to generalize the way that he did i also noticed that he kept repeating the word they and them like we were some vicious robots that act think and speak alike with one brain even if it was for a split second that someone looked at me and thought so shes a terrorist that is one split second too much i have never in my life done anything to intentionally hurt anyone and to be accused of being one that intentionally inflicts pain upon others is hurtful and untrue it seems as if my genetic makeup caused him to automatically make an unfair assumption and that is racism at its worst
1157980 aids is a very big dragon the mythological dragon was slain by saint george the original knight in shining armour but this dragon must be slain by millions and millions of foot soldiers

1158002 theres also concerns that the us economy is continuing to slow

1158006 they should not be willy nilly trying to buy water at this time there is no plan
1158007 when you speak to those who have been charged with buying the water they concede there was no plan they just bought the cheapest water they could which was buying air space in dams it did not actually buy water at this time
1158008 for the first time and after years of inaction the environment will have an entitlement as governments allocate water

1158047 tottenham offered us about 20 million euros for arshavin but this amount is not nearly enough for us to accept it
1158048 if liverpool is prepared to pay spurs 18 million for robbie keane then spurs should expect to pay zenit a reasonable fee for arshavin
1158049 tottenham offered us about 20 million but this amount is not enough for us from the very beginning we explained that well only negotiate offers of 25 million or more
1158050 andrei is getting desperate he may not get away from zenit this season time seems to be running out for him
1158051 it gets to you just after the season finishes when you realise youre going to have to face the qualifiers before youre really up and running and thats the worst part of it
1158052 in the next round its different because you can say youve got the uefa cup if you lose but that doesnt make it any better if you dont get there its like everything else youve just got to win your games and make sure you do enough to get through
1158053 we didnt do enough in the first leg we werent bright enough and weve got to be in the second leg
1158054 the pressure will be on rangers to win and we can wait for our chances
1158055 our players do have that bit of experience but i dont think its down to that
1158056 for us at the moment the need is to get up to a competitive level and we havent done that so far
1158057 ravi is in good form with the bat and can do a good bowling job for us as well so hes got his opportunity when players get left out their only shop window then is to go and do the job in county cricket work on the problems that we tell then theyve got and then rectify them
1158058 what ravi has done is listen to that and has gone away and worked at his game and hes now got his chance hes a very determined character hes a big positive thinker and hell be very disappointed that he didnt perform last time around now hes in a situation where hes got another opportunity to do so
1158059 its not a panic as you can see from the selections
1158060 weve not changed the side dramatically were just trying to go in the direction weve gone before

1158064 we are unconvinced that the government have properly thought through this aspect of their proposed scheme
1158065 there is a risk that this will be perceived to undermine the independence of the judiciary
1158066 conflating the roles of parliament and the judiciary which would be quite inappropriate
1158067 far from being a system of checks and balances this is a recipe for confusion that places on parliament tasks that it cannot effectively fulfil and arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1158068 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1158069 strike the correct balance between the right of everyone in the uk to be protected from terrorism and the need to preserve individual civil liberties
1158070 we will consider carefully the committees comments on the role of parliament in relation to pre charge detention
1158071 we believe however that it is right that parliament should have the opportunity to fully debate and approve the bringing into force of such an exceptional power
1158072 the government should abandon this measure and concentrate on delivering things that will actually make us safer such as allowing the use of intercept evidence in terror trials and establishing a dedicated uk border police force
1158073 not only are we seeing the re emergence of the six flags brand but we are also beginning to yield the economic benefits of being the worlds premier regional theme park company
1158074 despite a difficult economic environment through july we have witnessed solid revenue growth while at the same time reducing our operating expenses by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and labor investments
1158075 six flags is expanding as an entertainment company by identifying new revenue streams while simultaneously revitalizing its core business this has been the fundamental objective of our turnaround plan our momentum through july indicates that the strategy is taking hold with long term value being the endgame
1158076 household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1158077 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix
1158078 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1158079 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1158080 i believe that i have been road tested and trialed and i have found myself willing
1158081 and i could do for sen mccain what i did for president bushs father put him over the top with the republican party baseline
1158082 and i can do it all over again im rested and ready and set to rip into this campaign like a tissue paper tiger
1158083 if we can deposit men on mars as we have been doing we can get a republican elected president this year and im just the astronaut to help sen mccain win the white house
1158084 i am not closing the door to any team i like the premier league and the way they play their football
1158085 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening everyone is really disappointed
1158086 i learned a lot in the last two years having been injured so much i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period to be in i just do not want to think about that negative things if you think positive you get positive
1158087 we will be feeding into the public sector review and we have to get this right going forward
1158088 what does the licence fee payer want there are 12 main sports on the bbc and for cricket not to be one of them shows there is a mismatch of priorities cricket fans are licence fee payers and we believe they deserve better from the government and the bbc
1158089 im repeatedly asked when itll cricket be back on bbc screens to which all we can say is watch this space the rights will be tendered in the next year or so and weve said wed like to bid
1158090 the news report is completely false and baseless there are no such plans
1158091 this doesnt mean that ambani isnt interested in investing from his personal wealth outside his company
1158092 yes we are doing some promotional work with newcastle but were not in talks with them about any takeover
1158093 i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game although you have to be accountable for the things you do and be responsible for the decisions you make
1158094 the way i play is by gut instinct i like to do things spontaneously
1158095 i dont think i would be sitting here today if i wasnt 100 per cent confident that everything is going to be perfectly fine
1158096 peter likes to challenge players but the crux of the meeting was to determine and decipher where peter and myself can take this england team
1158097 when i first came over to play county cricket i couldnt really envisage playing for england to be honest
1158098 everything has happened so quickly yet i believe everything happens for a reason and this is a wonderful opportunity and im going to run with it
1158099 peter likes to challenge the players on a daily basis
1158100 there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room i sat down with peter and had a real good discussion about how we want to take this team forward
1158101 i think my position from player to captain is now totally different but im 100 per cent confident that ill have a working relationship with peter and i wouldnt be here today as england captain if i wasnt absolutely confident that everything will be fine
1158102 one of the most exciting things is that ive had phone calls and texts from the senior players whove basically said we support you were right behind you and give it a great shot once youve got the support of the lads around you the ones youre with all the time theres nothing more that you can ask for
1158103 kevin will have his own ideas of captaincy and take it his own way
1158104 hell bring a fresh approach and lead the team in an exciting manner we know what his capabilities are and im sure hell take us forward
1158105 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play
1158106 it would be silly of me to start thinking that it definitely will ive been successful playing the way i do and its something i want to keep doing
1158107 following michael vaughan leaves me with huge boots to fill
1158108 but im not going to be a wimp and say no im not going to do it
1158109 its a great honour and a great privilege and im going to accept this challenge and give it a real good go like i give everything in my life a go the last 24 hours have been huge for me but weve got to get ourselves right for this test against south africa and go out and salvage some pride
1158110 that was too short just a quick outing i was just 24 hours in the job i didnt have time to think about it
1158111 youre playing beautifully china just keep going and the scores will come
1158112 come on belly you cant keep on throwing it away like this sort it out

1158386 these pre clinical data provide the first firm basis for advancing pharmacologic ascorbate in cancer treatment in humans
1158387 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice
1158388 there is currently no evidence from clinical trials in humans that injecting or consuming vitamin c is an effective way to treat cancer
1158389 a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine would give patients and doctors enormous advantages over current treatments both in developed and developing countries
1158390 even if this vaccine is not the final answer it could help the march towards a successful immunotherapeutic hiv vaccine
1158391 we welcome any new research that could lead to the development of effective treatments for psychosis especially if those treatments bring fewer of the horrible side effects that are associated with some medications for schizophrenia
1158392 these findings are exciting but we cant jump the gun this is one small study and it needs to be followed up with further research before any of us can be really excited about it
1158393 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
1158394 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1158395 distant from the religion with which god has blessed them
1158396 today the jihad arena is missing its men and calling upon its heroes
1158397 dont god and islam have a right to be defended by the young and the old say to those who have dignity wherever they are you will despair if you do not respond the infidel people have come here to fight you for the sake of their false religion and they are killed and wounded for the sake of hell we direct a special call to the specialized people like doctors and electronic engineers due to their urgent need by the mujahideen the battle needs a combination of experiences and efforts we call on the fathers and mothers not to become a barrier between their children and paradise and to present their children for the sake of god our religion is more precious than ourselves and encouraging children to fight and sacrificing them for the sake of god is a clear sign of piety and righteousness
1158398 with the purpose of establishing a global center for the mujahideen who had converged on afghanistan to fight the soviets from all over the world
1158399 is the leader of the infidels in this age and is holding the flag of the cross today
1158400 both of them are acting as the enemies of islam and are in a state of war against the muslim community
1158401 after all it is these people americans who choose governments through their votes and it is they who voted president george w bush to power for the second term although they were well aware of his hostile agenda against islam
1158402 may be a few such wise people among the american nation who may be displeased with these activities
1158403 obligatory upon them that they should not vote for such tyrannical governments
1158404 their defeat in afghanistan is even more clear and evident
1158405 it is a shame even to call such people the pakistani guards at the danish embassy pakistanis or muslims

1158420 these results to some extent confirm suspicions that many people have about the importance of a persons college choice in giving them better pay opportunities down the line
1158421 what we still dont know is whether or not its the training or education the school provides that drives these pay differences or if the people from those schools are just wired to self select into jobs that are likely to be paid more
1158422 it is entirely a matter for her and her family to decide whether they will make a comment

1158432 one of the things we are looking at is whether there could be a veto system introduced where a person can be banned from all venues
1158433 we are already looking at systems which have combated antisocial behaviour in other places like the uk to see how they might apply to the waterfront precinct
1158434 a whole new approach could be taken in hobart but ultimately we still need to work out if new rules can be effectively policed how will people be monitored how will breaches be handled and how can a publican who bans an individual or group get the word out to other pubs and nightclubs
1158435 we all agree on one thing we need to combat anti social behaviour right now and a precinct wide crackdown could be the way to go

1158441 the costs of maintaining a facility like this are very high and just cant be sustained the way we are going weve used up all our cash reserves
1158442 hendra virus is very rare and the circumstances surrounding this outbreak even rarer
1158443 government does not compensate business for loss of trade due to a disease outbreak or s imilar emergency situation matters relating to business continuity are a commercial decision for the individual business
1158444 what we are doing is beyond what legislation outlines during a disease outbreak but this is an extraordinary case and the ava and the government are responding to it as such
1158445 the bottom line is our worst nightmare is that two of our staff are in hospital
1158446 everything else well we can live with it we are all able to get up and go about our business
1158447 the worst thing that could happen is if the response is not adequate that the next person to discover they have hendra on their property tried to hide it
1158448 i am old older than thought in your species which is itself fifty times older than your history though i have been on earth for ages i am from the stars my home is no one planet for many worlds scattered through the shining disc of the galaxy have conditions which allow my spores an opportunity for life the mushroom which you see is the part of my body given to sex thrills and sun bathing my true body is a fine network of fibers growing through the soil these networks may cover acres and may have far more connections that the number in a human brain my mycelial network is nearly immortal only the sudden toxification of a planet or the explosion of its parent star can wipe me out by means impossible to explain because of certain misconceptions in your model of reality all my mycelial networks in the galaxy are in hyperlight communication across space and time the mycelial body is as fragile as a spiders web but the collective hypermind and memory is a vast historical archive of the career of evolving intelligence on many worlds in our spiral star swarm space you see is a vast ocean to those hardy life forms that have the ability to reproduce from spores for spores are covered with the hardest organic substance known across the aeons of time and space drift many spore forming life forms in suspended animation for millions of years until contact is made with a suitable environment few such species are minded only myself and my recently evolved near relatives have achieved the hyper communication mode and memory capacity that makes us leading members in the community of galactic intelligence how the hypercommunication mode operates is a secret which will not be lightly given to man but the means should be obvious it is the occurrence of psilocybin and psilocin in the biosynthetic pathways of my living body that opens for me and my symbiots the vision screens to many worlds you as an individual and man as a species are on the brink of the formation of a symbiotic relationship with my genetic material that will eventually carry humanity and earth into the galactic mainstream of the higher civilizations since it is not easy for you to recognize other varieties of intelligence around you your most advanced theories of politics and society have advanced only as far as the notion of collectivism but beyond the cohesion of the members of a species into a single social organism there lie richer and even more baroque evolutionary possibilities symbiosis is one of these symbiosis is a relation of mutual dependence and positive benefits for both of the species involved symbiotic relationships between myself and civilized forms of higher animals have been established many times and in many places throughout the long ages of my development these relationships have been mutually useful within my memory is the knowledge of hyperlight drive ships and how to build them i will trade this knowledge for a free ticket to new worlds around suns younger and more stable than your own to secure an eternal existence down the long river of cosmic time i again and again offer this agreement to higher beings and thereby have spread throughout the galaxy over the long millennia a mycelial network has no organs to move the world no hands but higher animals with manipulative abilities can become partners with the star knowledge within me and if they act in good faith return both themselves and their humble mushroom teacher to the million worlds all citizens of our starswarm are heir to
1158449 how to easily find out which of your pages have been stumbled
1158450 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1158451 the costs of children left fatherless of men behaving badly are borne by us all
1158452 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1158453 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1158454 we have to get the balance right between being a nanny state and a neglectful state
1158455 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have not banned it but we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behaviour
1158456 i find this particular line from the government to be tiptoeing through the daffodils
1158457 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1158458 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1158459 school nurses can make a real difference in helping children develop healthy habits but the government has failed to address the chronic shortage of school nurses
1158460 if ministers are serious about their plans to tackle child obesity then they should use this opportunity to really highlight the health risks it causes
1158461 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1158462 the total amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation
1158463 police are investigating the arrival of campaigners believed to have breached their bail conditions but we cannot confirm how many arrests have been made
1158464 im pretty nervous about being arrested because ive never been to prison it will be bad but the worst thing about being arrested will be that i wont get to go to an event that i have been planning for a long time this is one of the most important issues of our generation and its vital that we are allowed to discuss it its tragic that the police seem to want to stop that

1158470 these days there are homeowners groups all over the place
1158471 there are probably thousands of meetings a week with a small effort on their part our programs could make a big difference in the community
1158472 its easy to forget we live in a semi arid environment
1158473 creators get to create only with the permission of the powerful or of creators from the past
1158474 mr ohno scolded us after first making us really think and struggle and this helped us to come to a deeper understanding
1158475 dont look with your look with your feet dont think with you head think with your hands
1158476 people who cant understand numbers are useless the gemba where numbers are not visible is also bad however people who only look at the numbers are the worst of all
1158477 what is the behavior required from management to develop thinking people
1158478 lets go to the gemba show me the real thing and explain it to me again
1158479 the sentence is clearly not robust enough for the crime and the failure to provide a package of care completely inappropriate
1158480 you were found guilty of the culpable homicide of your wife who you were together with for many years
1158481 in normal circumstances this would attract a prison sentence in double figures
1158482 i have read and considered a number of reports from experts it is plain to me that if i were to impose that sort of sentence you would be released in a very short time because prison would not be able to cope with your condition
1158483 sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty
1158484 you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives
1158485 not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
1158486 this is clearly a very difficult case in which there has been a mental illness involved
1158487 however the real issue here is that the sentence has not been robust enough to protect the public from him doing anything similar again
1158488 there has been no effort to provide any kind of appropriate care package to deal with this mans mental health condition
1158489 a restriction of liberty order is clearly inappropriate in a case as serious as this
1158490 its a quite shocking sentence for a crime like this
1158491 there are obviously a lot of people with dementia who are being treated in prison although we dont know how serious his condition is
1158492 the whole issue of the provision of care for dementia sufferers needs to be looked at in the light of this case as there would clearly be issues if he was to be treated in a care home
1158493 im not entirely sure what the best sentence for this individual would be but its certainly not appropriate for him to receive a restriction of liberty order
1158494 the report prepared for the court paints a picture of a man in significant physical and mental decline
1158495 there is a clear diagnosis of dementia setting in it is a progressive condition and ultimately he will need 24 hour care
1158496 i am deeply conscious there has been a death here but this man is very unwell
1158497 he was always willing to plead guilty to culpable homicide but this was flatly rejected by the crown and that is why a trial was necessary
1158498 it must have been me there are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that
1158499 blocked inas killing out of his memory because it was so dreadful
1158500 we never comment on specific cases but at the end of the day the only people who can provide sensible judgment on a case are those who hold all the relevant evidence
1158501 we do definitely have prisoners with dementia although its not possible to say exactly how many we have people in our prisons with all manner of medical conditions the only exceptions would be those people with terminal illness who have a few months to live that are better suited to hospital treatment
1158502 there are a lot of dementia sufferers who are not violent and there may be questions about how to deal with this individual if he does not adhere to his restriction of liberty order
1158503 the key thing in this particular case is that the judge has seen all the relevant medical reports i am satisfied that the normal sentencing considerations could not be applied
1158504 trust the invisible hand of the market it will take us where we need to be
1158505 give us this day our daily bread and the gasoline whereby to drive us to the place of earning thereof

1158531 no estoy aqu s lo por mi es cierto que debemos aprovechar todos juntos pues cuando subo al p lpito no es para ense ar s lo a los dem s yo no me sit o aparte pues debo ser escolar y la palabra que sale de mis labios debe servirme tanto como a vosotros o caer la desgracia sobre mi
1158532 si estoy aqu en el p lpito y pretendo que se me escuche en nombre de dios y acabo seduciendo al pueblo es un orgullo que supera cualquier otro

1158535 por tanto cuando expongo las sagradas escrituras tengo que atenerme siempre a ellas es decir que los que me oyen reciban beneficio de la doctrina que propongo que hayan sido edificados hasta la salvaci n si no tengo esa afecci n y no procuro la edificaci n de los que me oyen soy un sacr lego profanando la palabra de dios
1158536 qu sermones hab a entonces en toda europa que representaran la simplicidad en la que san pablo quer a que el pueblo cristiano permaneciera toda la vida d nde estaba el serm n que ense ara a las viejas algo m s que fantas as para contar todo un mes en su hogar pues sus predicaciones estaban ordenadas de tal modo que una de las partes estaba situada en las oscuras y dif ciles preguntas de la escuela para despertar la admiraci n de pueblo pobre y llano la otra consist a en alegres f bulas y especulaciones entretenidas para animar y conmover los corazones se entremezclaban algunos vocablos de la palabra de dios para que la majestad que ten an dieran color a sus sue os y fantas as pero en cuanto los nuestros levantaron su bandera en un momento todas esas tinieblas se despejaron entre vosotros ahora bien vuestros predicadores en parte preparados y formados en los libros de stos y en parte obligados por la verg enza y murmuraci n del pueblo a conformarse con el ejemplo de los arriba citados aun no es posible que sientan totalmente esta tonter a y bobada de suerte que si comparamos nuestra forma de predicar con la suya incluso con la que les es m s querida se sabr f cilmente que nos has hecho una gran afrenta
1158537 yo que hablo ahora no debo aportar nada m o y no debo tampoco elevarme por encima de los dem s pues en realidad no digo a toda la concurrencia que es necesario que esta doctrina se dirija a mi en primer lugar y que domine por encima de todos sin excepci n

1158647 a small number of very passionate american ideological leaders visited prussia in the first half of the 19th century fell in love with the order obedience and efficiency of its education system and campaigned relentlessly thereafter to bring the prussian vision to these shores
1158648 the whole system was built on the premise that isolation from first hand information and fragmentation of the abstract information presented by teachers would result in obedient and subordinate graduates properly respectful of arbitrary orders

1158684 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
1158685 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1158686 damn it must be good if they pulled all those stars
1158687 call 1 866 675 2008 press 6 and demand that obama go on offense
1158688 my friends and i are tearing our hair out that the campaign isnt on offense were waiting for it
1158689 i know were getting a lot of calls like this you want us to hit back
1158690 okay but theres no good time to wait you should go after him now
1158691 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1158692 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1158693 you feel sad and sick that one of the guys youre an authority figure over and you care about got himself in trouble
1158694 you also hate the fact those guys do represent this program and this program represents this university and this university represents this state it represents anybody who claims to be a bulldog i feel sick about that
1158695 i mean theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction because it has been
1158696 if a guy has a first time offense i dont believe in throwing that guy under the bus to try to stave off the wolves so to speak
1158697 i dont think its fair to the guy dewberry for example i dont think i should throw dewberry off the football team ive never had a problem with darius dewberry
1158698 we will look into other ways of making sure we do a better job
1158699 i dont know if i would blame him for it with whats gone on this offseason
1158700 downtown that can be fun for a lot of guys but the team and what were able to do this season is a lot more important than going out and having fun with college students
1158701 mr dennis hunt has done an outstanding job of creating a nationwide awareness in the roadbuilding industry of the importance of energy conservation and good practices in the operation of asphalt plants showing operators how to reduce energy consumption improve the quality of hot mix asphalt for our highways extend the life of the plant equipment and significantly reduce the environmental impact of asphalt plants
1158702 dennis has been addressing plant production and energy conservation issues as well as the introduction of warm mix asphalt with the passion of a true green missionary
1158703 durante todo el fin de semana he sido m s r pido que mi compa ero
1158704 eso demuestra que si el coche va bien puedo demostrar mi potencial
1158705 nuestro problema ha sido la consistencia pero espero que ahora podamos empezar a cambiar eso
1158706 it doesnt matter about the quality of programming we show children as long as its full of bright flashy images commercials consumerism and politically correct characters
1158707 classic cartoon favorites vol 1 2 3 4 etc was only a mere 9 99 but to me they were priceless
1158708 its just life man youve just got to grow from your mistakes
1158709 thats what i did and thats how i look at it i was there for a reason and now i just have to learn from it
1158710 no one wants to go to jail but youve got to learn from your mistakes because you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1158711 its just a juvenile offense its something that happened years ago
1158712 i had to serve those 30 days because i made that mistake
1158713 ill do whatever i have to do to get through this
1158714 after the last 30 days it will be behind me
1158715 ive done nothing wrong since i was drafted by the giants
1158716 there is no question about that it should be over with all of this comes from the juvenile offense
1158717 no like i said it goes back to when i was a juvenile
1158718 they the giants have treated me great they have nothing against me
1158719 i plan to do exactly what i did last year come out and play my game
1158720 its a very big relief for me just to be a part of this team coming out here and having fun with my teammates
1158721 of course its always going to be in the back of your head
1158722 with me when im on the field im in another mind state and i just go out there and play my game
1158723 just being here its a relief just to be here around all of these guys and just to be a part of this team
1158724 im just trying to come out here and make a name for myself just do my job i think everything happens for a reason
1158725 he had a limited amount of work but its a good sign that hes out there
1158726 it was good to see the linebacker numbers increase today
1158727 it looked like he had his best day of practice and then the next thing i know his back was bothering him theyre running a bunch of tests and i dont have any information on it how hes doing obviously hes not practicing hes got some pain
1158728 i have to get my work and my drills in
1158729 im like a pitcher i have to build up my stamina but im ready to go now i just have to maintain what ive developed up to this point playing the first game you still have to get used to the timing of the game we dont get the timing in practice as far as the rush speed not only that but we dont go live during punt so the rookies have to know that the game is going to go faster im ready to go i feel great and just take one day at a time
1158730 theyll come down in their shirts and helmets do a normal stretch jog through their special teams and then theyll do a big separate deal where theyre on opposite sides of the field and then we will come together and run some five on fives against each other but it will just be jog through pace
1158731 the afternoon will be a regular practice although im not sure exactly how thats going to go yet
1158732 reside on the high side of life living among sixteen floors of luxury apartment homes located in the center of the prestigious brewery blocks of the pearl district
1158733 theres more but as the story notes pierre isnt even being benched
1158734 no one better suited to reverse the fortunes of the cubs for the long term
1158735 i think the only thing we care about is that whoever gets it is committed to winning
1158736 we dont want someone coming in here and all they care about is making money and cutting payroll and putting it in his pocket
1158737 i actually talked with street on friday and just said with the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
1158738 okay well take manny off your hands for you but you have to pay his salary pay for the draft picks well get when we dont re sign him pay mr lorias mortgage and build us a new stadium oh and were not giving you anything in return either deal
1158739 treat the earth well it was not given to you by your parents it was loaned to you by your children
1158740 we designated wednesday of every week as quarry day excavation will take place from 2 00pm to 4 00pm
1158741 we dont expect any more complaints of flying stones or vibrations from the residents if any arises we will take tough action
1158742 it is a malicious allegation that animals were not producing milk or mating because of the blasts
1158743 you get bored with the same thing but thats just part of it it was fun a lot more productive than i thought it was going to be i thought peoples tempers would be flying but it really wasnt it was good it was a good practice i got a lot out of it
1158744 i think it seemed like the defense got the best ends on both sides of the field which would be normal situation with guys coming in and not knowing what the other side is going to do exactly and what theyve been doing all offseason
1158745 it was just that when i hit him it kind of lifted him up i guess it was kind of too hard for him i didnt really hit him that hard but he got kind of upset
1158746 if things are important to you you will fight about it
1158747 we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work
1158748 i didnt look to start any fights or anything like that
1158749 as my coach said if you get into anything be careful to do it safely and be smart i just pretty much walked away from everything
1158750 those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
1158751 theres not the sense of vindictiveness as much as its like playing against your sibling
1158752 i got a lot of love up here that felt good i wasnt sure what it was going to be like but a lot of my former teammates gave me a lot of love and that was nice
1158753 the ten commandments are the foundation of western morality and the american constitution and government
1158754 to show a sense of regard for to have compassion upon
1158755 hola a qu te dedicas edad follas o haces el amor
1158756 yo estoy muy contenta porque como el gobierno nos ha prometido que nos pagar a todos los espa oles la misma cantidad de euros que lo que cobrar n de prima los jugadores seguro que se terminan mis problemas econ micos
1158757 a recent innovation is to have a social worker and an islamic cleric counsel detainees before they go before their first multi national forces review committee mnfrc said rear adm
1158758 also last february we started having officers from multi national corps iraqs capturing unit sit on our mnfrc boards
1158759 engagement services are highly desired by the detainees most of the detainees have had a positive experience with the islamic discussion program and the level 1 education grades 1 3 we have witnessed many of the detainees returning from class and sharing notes and thoughts with their compound members
1158760 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
1158761 it was a decision i made on my experience and the information given to me
1158762 obviously it coincided with the events everyone is talking about
1158763 we hope these videos will support the healthy emotional development of military children and adolescents during potentially difficult times in their lives
1158764 we also hope these videos will decrease feelings of stigma and isolation in our military children while sensitizing the larger american community to military child and adolescent culture and support needs
1158765 our goal is to reduce the anxiety and fear surrounding a military deployment and let children know they are not alone in the struggles their families are facing
1158766 within just a couple of weeks of my departure my normally well behaved 4 year old son started having some acting out behavior and a little bit of regression kind of moving backward in his development
1158767 he was expressing that he wasnt comfortable with my absence
1158768 when i got back from my deployment a lot of other soldiers were deploying and i began to notice a lot of children who were presenting with complaints of headaches and stomachaches that i couldnt explain
1158769 as pediatricians we are not trained to look that closely at how emotional concerns and stress affect the physical health of our young patients
1158770 however we are hoping to address that lack of training through the videos weve developed and many other opportunities developing through the military child and adolescent center of excellence that is being established at madigan army medical center
1158771 as we start to frame the discussion more in terms of military family readiness and support it is becoming more popular
1158772 as we provide more support for our military families to prepare them for the potential stresses of deployment and separation then our warriors are going to be more able to focus on their mission
1158773 being a military child or adolescent is actually a very unique experience
1158774 we think belonging to a military family really is a special thing military children serve and sacrifice for their nation in a way that is very important and is different from the way we as military servicemembers serve and sacrifice
1158775 they advocate for educational issues for children making sure that military children are treated fairly when they transfer into new school districts and that their credits transfer and they dont have to retake the basic history course every time they move to a new place because they are military kids
1158776 we know children experience stress differently based on their developmental age
1158777 younger children may have significant attachment concerns when their parents deploy they need to attach to their parents feel comfortable and connected in order to grow up emotionally healthy

1158780 gone to the store because the only food i own is a chicken finger shaped like a bunny rabbit
1158781 full of the kind of wild ideas that comics used to do all the time

1158784 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1158785 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1158786 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on
1158787 for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1158788 simply put alan has been put on notice as of today
1158789 that without pre empting the outcome it is very likely they a breach would have an immediate and ultimate outcome on the termination of alans contract
1158790 alan is very clear from this meeting that it will be a turning point in his career in either direction clear lines have been drawn in the sand
1158791 right now the way im feeling is that if we played a game right now against st kilda and the st kilda boys roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id be over there to support him to tell you the truth youve done it you cop it
1158792 i know once i get to saturday night were definitely all in it together
1158793 para m es muy importante estar nuevamente en los 200 km de buenos aires esta carrera no s lo me posibilita volver a correr haci ndolo en equipos como el de berta que est en los primeros planos sino competir con pilotos de otros pa ses es nica me hace rejuvenecer unos a os sentirme bien me da placer y mucha adrenalina despu s de varios a os de no correr necesito volver a sentir sobre un auto de carreras
1158794 yo represent a ypf desde mis comienzos la marca ford es muy importante para m y estar con berta es fundamental tener las puertas abiertas en un equipo c mo este que me tengan en cuenta para una invitaci n lo valoro mucho el equipo est con chances de ganar y a pesar de que estoy retirado que hayan pensado en m es fabuloso
1158795 s estoy trabajando mucho f sicamente me hace muy bien correr esta carrera ya baj cinco kilos y tengo muchas ganas son sensaciones dif ciles de describir porque siempre involucran a la pasi n
1158796 creo que no hay que buscar un auto r pido para una vuelta si no que hay que apostar al buen ritmo y que las parejas de pilotos sean equilibradas el tiempo ocupado en el cambio de pilotos tambi n es fundamental
1158797 no todav a no hablamos de ese tema despu s de las pruebas que hicimos en la pista de oreste berta s a descubr que el focus es un auto muy d cil de manejar tuve un excelente recepci n de parte de gabriel ponce de le n y de mart n basso y me siento como si hubiera estado en el equipo siempre
1158798 this is probably a surprise to wall street because the early data have been better for telaprevir
1158799 i think its probably too early to conclude one is better than the other
1158800 will be the most capable vessel the coast guard has ever sailed
1158801 american taxpayers are getting a good bang for their buck
1158802 the difficulties right now are very deep and im hoping we can get past them
1158803 we fundamentally do not believe in taxes and wont go there
1158804 weve not seen any language that would indicate they are serious about budget reform
1158805 for a situation that will be resolved in the next two or three weeks
1158806 for the first time ive seen iraqi security forces that can plan prepare and execute first class offensive operations
1158807 ive also seen a high level of trust and respect by the people of rashid for their own army and police forces
1158808 together we conduct relentless offensive operations designed to kill capture or drive from rashid anyone who threatens the safety and security of the people we have sworn to protect
1158809 i believe this reduction in violence is a direct result of the conditions set by the success of the surge in forces and combat power
1158810 we built on this success and have seen a dramatic reduction in violence in the past four months
1158811 emplaced by special group criminals who operate as part of the illegal militias in baghdad
1158812 i think they want to undermine the government and theyre using the neighborhoods of rashid as a battlefield
1158813 there seemed to be a wedge that was placed between the people and the insurgents and we tried to exploit that
1158814 it is my firm belief that the decisive defeat of the special group criminals and militias in may and june of this year has opened a window of opportunity for us to make substantial and lasting improvements in the rashid district
1158815 we have captured more than 170 special group criminals associated with the jaysh al mahdi militia
1158816 seizing on the improved security conditions we are pursuing reconstruction projects to improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1158817 weve also proposed an additional 117 projects valued at more than 26 million
1158818 each project is coordinated with the rashid district council leadership to ensure that we are meeting the needs of the people
1158819 he may have been tipped when the raid was very close
1158820 we are sure fazul is in mombasa we are closing in on him and the operations are slowly bearing fruit
1158821 all public and private hospitals in mombasa and malindi should remain under guard all border points and the routes from somalia should equally be manned properly we must not also forget the proper surveillance of our sea line
1158822 fazul is expected to be sneaked in for treatment in a private hospital in mombasa or malindi anytime we must stay alert
1158823 he then used a matatu to malindi he camouflages his appearances whenever he goes to the mosques his nickname is chameleon
1158824 projections show that by the year 2030 every american will be overweight
1158825 weve got to do something since the city has custody of the peoples garbage i thought why not use this power for good
1158826 you know we can learn a lot from peoples garbage
1158827 what theyre eating reading wearing all can be deduced from what people throw away
1158828 if theyre eating the wrong food too much food or are wasting food that costs society by identifying who is imposing these costs we can begin to correct the behaviors that cause them
1158829 dieticians could be sent to counsel those exhibiting poor food related skills we could provide healthy menus and food preparation instructions if necessary residents showing signs of obesity could be signed up for aerobics lessons
1158830 well be looking at mental health too if there is evidence that someone has been reading racist sexist homophobic or other similar deranged literature we can provide re education services
1158831 tell him to inspect poop for traces of peanuts and almonds and other evils
1158832 the state of texas will not only refrain from objecting but will join the defense in asking the reviewing court to address
1158833 authorizes relief based on legislation that has been introduced but not enacted especially not where congress has taken no action in the over four years since the world court decision and where there is no remote let alone reasonable expectation that both houses of congress will approve the legislation nor does any rule of law exist to determine how much 9more delay is needed to further confirm that no action is indeed forthcoming
1158834 intelligence information is essential to defeating the insurgent terrorist threat and establishing iraqi self reliance
1158835 in the past few months weve seen an unprecedented level of cooperation among the agencies to support the tactical commanders at the regional operations command centers providing strategic and operational intelligence as well as targeting information to those commands
1158836 the capability to produce and action targets has significantly and ill say exponentially improved in all the agencies over the last quarter
1158837 the iraqi security forces have removed a significant amount of terrorists and criminals over 1 200 from april through june as a result of this focused targeting
1158838 were also looking at adding small throw and go unmanned aerial vehicles and some increased analytical capabilities
1158839 ill just say that trust remains an issue both internally within the agencies and external ly among the agencies
1158840 personnel vetting and associated security procedures while improving are not yet sufficiently mature
1158841 establishing improving and sustaining a professionalized intelligence corps but the academy needs to expand its facility to add additional instructors and increase the output of graduates from 2 000 a year in 2009 to about 3 000 a year by 2010 or 2011
1158842 during the past five months weve seen the iraqi security forces take the lead in significant operations in basra sadr city baghdad mosul al amarah and now just this week in diyala
1158843 the successes by the isf in these operations are a result of investments made by the united states the citizens of iraq and the work of the coalition forces to improve the capacity capability and professionalism of the iraqi security forces
1158844 we got notified a day in advance that 70 somalis were being transferred from a tyson foods plant in nebraska
1158845 emporia is going to be its own 3rd world country before long because of all the damn bleeding hearts
1158846 they came post 9 11 theyre black and theyre muslim
1158847 emporia didnt have many black people before this is a small town
1158848 having those somali workers here causes even more problems than staffing plants with illegal mexicans
1158849 the difference between obama and osama is just a little b
1158850 however these artifacts would be more attractive for tourists if they could be preserved and exhibited in their original location
1158851 we are looking for a sponsor for the construction of such a structure
1158852 the rights plan is not intended for defensive or anti takeover purposes and is in the best interests of all stockholders of hovnanian
1158853 it will be increasingly difficult to manage costs to limit margin contraction as revenue continues to decline
1158854 sent shock waves to every corner of the media landscape
1158855 we are factoring in higher loss rates and higher reserve build through 2009 balance sheet shrinkage and the 55 million at 1 10 per share in additional capital through the rights offering announced
1158856 our view is one that while the near term will be disruptive and inconsistent we do expect the near term to be the trough therefore our view is buy now versus waiting for the improvement into 2009 to materialize and most likely the shares reflecting it
1158857 support the goal of transitioning 85 percent of americas new motor vehicles to non petroleum based fuels within 20 years
1158858 our country faces a critical challenge because of skyrocketing energy costs
1158859 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue the time for delay is over we need to act now
1158860 a little hot coming up to that stop sign werent we
1158861 in a big country dreams stay with you like a lovers voice stay alive
1158862 cause i dreamt this all before it happened and then i made it real
1158863 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1158864 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1158865 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1158866 they needed someone high profile with engineering talent and certainly this guy fits the bill
1158867 the only downside is that he doesnt necessarily have any consumer products expertise
1158868 in terms of actual products hitting the street youre not going to see jhas impact before 2010
1158869 probably his biggest impact will be the level and type of engineering talent he will attract to the company over time
1158870 motorola will only be successful if this new team creates a complete solution that includes hardware software and services similar to apple
1158871 while the iphone is a great phone its real value comes from its software applications and services
1158872 although creating slick phones is one part of the success equation apples success will force even traditional handset makers to think harder about the software and services angle if they are to really compete with apple head on
1158873 theres a tremendous opportunity here to take this business to the next level
1158874 in search of brighter days i ride through the maze of the madness struggle is my address where pain and crack lives gunshots comin from sounds of blackness given this game with no time to practice born on the black list told im below average a life with no cabbage thats no money if you from where im from funny i just want some of your sun dark clouds seem to follow me alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me no apology i walk with a boulder on my shoulder its a cold war im a colder soldier hold the same fight that made martin luther the king i aint usin it for the right thing in between lean and the fiends hustle and the schemes i put together pieces of a dream i still have one i got a dream were gonna work it out my dream is to be free
1158875 a house is made of walls and beams a home is built with love and dreams
1158876 i was privileged in the spring to visit a home that was to me and i am sure to the occupants a little piece of heaven there was beauty there there was a keen appreciation of the finer things in life and an atmosphere in which it was impossible to keep from thinking of god
1158877 atmosphere in which it was impossible to keep from thinking of god
1158878 no matter where we live youve always managed to make it homey

1158882 this is a remote place and its already getting late send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food
1158883 they do not need to go away you give them something to eat
1158884 we have here only fiveloaves of bread and two fish
1158885 well if thats all we have then the equation is settled
1158886 you give what you have and let me worry about the distribution issues

1158888 i am choosing to live operate on me as if im alive not dead
1158889 the u s government and the iraqi ministry of health work in partnership to ensure that all health care facilities are built in areas where services are most needed and that the projects we are working fit the needs of the country
1158890 is a must for the country to continue to thrive
1158891 by focusing our efforts the gulf region division in partnership with ministry of health has made great strides in providing iraqis with the medical care they need and deserve
1158892 as of today we have completed 116 of the 132 new clinics and turned them over to the ministry of health
1158893 however we have found that some newly opened clinics are seeing 300 or more patients a day
1158894 clearly these facilities are filling a need in the neighborhoods that they are serving
1158895 has put together a program to facilitate the return of these doctors through giving them privileges and accommodations in addition to generous salaries that you cannot find anywhere in neighboring countries
1158896 is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader
1158897 why are these people making a big deal about me im just going to go somewhere else tomorrrow
1158898 always pour salt over your left shoulder if you spill it plant lavender for luck and rosemary at your garden gate and fall in love as often as possible
1158899 maybe ill just go get hit by a bus and then you can have the insurance money thats all you want anyway
1158900 nah you wont do it youre too curious about tomorrow
1158901 painting a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1158902 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1158903 we need to recognise that its those fathers whove abandoned their responsibilities not mothers left holding the baby who should be challenged about their behaviour
1158904 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing

1158923 this may be only one hospital with results taken in a transitional period but we believe this could be typical of the national picture
1158924 it is striking that nobody up until to this point has actually asked patients about their experience of the system
1158925 we recognise when choose and book was launched in 2004 there were some initial teething problems today with more than 10 million bookings the university college london ucl study of 104 patients from a single hospital two years ago does not reflect the experience of most users

1158927 all looks good who knows what is causing your issues
1158928 how can i find the courage to live my ideals
1158929 why did i choose to do that whats wrong with me why was i so weak
1158930 how could she learn to drive lady the nerve of some people id certainly never do that people are always cutting in front of me and not just in traffic they are so selfish why isnt it ever my turn im always so considerate and look what i get nothing no one even notices
1158931 that lady must be in a hurry im glad i was able to slow down and let her in i bet a lot of people get mad at her maybe shes so tired she didnt even notice me luckily the universe can accommodate our mistakes
1158932 lets face it charles you are a failure the reason no one wants your book is that you really have nothing to offer who do you think you are dropping out of the system refusing to get a normal job as if you were too good for it your repeated failure is a message from the universe to stop trying dont be like the man who tried to bash down a brick wall with his head and when it didnt work thought he just needed to bash harder
1158933 the reason your work has not been accepted yet is because it is new and original the repeated failures are a kind of test the universe is giving you a chance to demonstrate to yourself your own commitment to show yourself that you really believe in your work if it all came easy you would never really know how committed you are

1158940 the moral compass of the nsw government is pointing a long way south
1158941 firstly we have a minister for health denying victims face to face grief counselling support and now reba meagher believes that the governments conduct in the hiring and firing of reeves was not found to be unreasonable or inappropriate
1158942 they have no answers as to who employed dr reeves at bega and pambula hospitals with reba meagher now declaring no one within her government is to blame
1158943 what comfort the victims might have in the reports recognition that dr reeves acted dishonestly will be outweighed by the anger they will rightly feel that the nsw government has washed its hands of any blame
1158944 mr garling has recommended changes to the health services act in line with amendments that the nsw liberals have introduced to parliament to make it law for hospitals to check a doctors background but so far reba meagher has refused to support this bill
1158945 the fact is that this doctor could lie and cheat his way into a job in the health system and it could happen again because ms meagher has failed to introduce laws that would require a hospital to check with the medical board to see whether a doctor is qualified to practise
1158946 i was a fairfield boy and when i passed out from the goulburn academy after 12 weeks i asked them to send me to anywhere where there were forests and mountains
1158947 there was a different mindset and a different relationship with the community and with each other
1158948 we were more authoritarian back then with each other and with the community
1158949 its a lot less adversarial a lot less crime and its more about being part of the community
1158950 some police struggle with becoming involved with the community but those who go to the country because they want to or have already lived in the country find it easy
1158951 i think country people generally think that fairs fair and if you get caught doing the wrong thing then you get caught doing the wrong thing
1158952 people want to live in a safe community and a safe community means having rules and people to enforce them
1158953 i dont feel ostracized at all in the community because of my occupation
1158954 people may not think it but we take pride in doing that
1158955 any time you can make someones life better like finding a missing child in a crowd or console a grieving relative or having an impact on the road toll by giving someone a ticket and slowing them down it is good
1158956 it gives us all a bad name when i know that the vast majority of cops are good people
1158957 of course the bad things include fatal car accidents and incidents like pericoe
1158958 but it is things like those that we take pride in doing well
1158959 then well see a population change a demographic change and a change in the crime rate perhaps
1158960 more people mean more cars and more accidents so we have to make sure we are aware of that
1158961 our target of protest has a lot to do with frank sartor minister for planning
1158962 what we see from this administration is a disregard for local communities and a series of poor planning decisions
1158963 i speak on behalf of a local group tathra action group and we have major concerns with proposed development at tathra river estate stage 2
1158964 locally our issues relate to a 300 dwelling development at tathra river estate stage 2
1158965 our experience as far as public consultation is most peculiar
1158966 the development proponent starts the ball rolling the local council starts its process and low and behold frank sartor says we need the refshauge review panel that will help you
1158967 after brief hearings a 200 page submission from the proponent a quick look around andrew refshauge recommends up to 300 dwellings at the estate stage 2
1158968 sewerage is going to be a stinker of a problem
1158969 the next issue is over development 300 dwellings at stage two of the estate equals 800 extra people for tathra
1158970 thats the size of pambula or two cobargos added to tathra
1158971 the local council believes this could be four times too large for the site and so do 2500 signators to our recent petition against 300 dwellings
1158972 what about sustainable planning for the natural and built environment
1158973 these are big issues for the local community environment and heritage
1158974 we can only hope that frank sartor reads the bega river estuary management plan of october 2007 which his department along with six other government bodies formulated
1158975 this plan needs to be gazetted so it is acted upon
1158976 the bega river is again closed pollutants are now concentrating in the estuary
1158977 council is not anti development but believes there should be limited dwellings on the tathra estate site
1158978 nsw labor party is a developers dream and the peoples nightmare
1158979 the owner of kameruka mr giles pritchard gordon is happy for the community to know he has made an offer on the site and is willing to negotiate with the council to resolve this poor planning decision
1158980 i am calling on the councillors to sell and undertake the necessary administrative processes to relinquish the property
1158981 the council would need to issue an expression of interest and follow due process however it would firstly require the councillors to bring forward a resolution to sell at a council meeting
1158982 the offer is on the table and if eventually taken up will hopefully ensure that the ratepayers are not out of pocket due to the six years of council administration and consultancy work undertaken on this poorly chosen tip site
1158983 i am very keen to work with the council to identify another site particularly if it is state government land
1158984 no state land was originally assessed back six years ago and given they have responsibility for 70 per cent of the shires estate it makes sense for an investigation to be commissioned into crown land sites which would be more suitable for a centralised waste facility
1158985 the current site is a shocker due to the fact it is on open farm land in the valley
1158986 one of my fears is what happens in 5 10 15 years when the tip begins to age
1158987 time and time again the current proposal has had problems as indicated by the nsw department of environment and climate change when assessing the eis
1158988 the staff will make an assessment of the offer based on a range of criteria
1158989 some of which include where council is up to with its planning environmental and financial requirements
1158990 in these instances there are certain requirements council has to follow under the local government act
1158991 and if the idea of selling recommendation did go to council there would need to be public expressions of interest and tenders called for
1158992 council began being in caretaker mode yesterday so it cant resolve any major issues
1158993 i anticipate the reversal will need to be started sooner rather than later

1159002 i dont think they took the time to really understand our business
1159003 if you like them are you willing to buy them
1159004 the customer never had intentions to buy the product they just wanted to try something new and have a new experience
1159005 we had consumers that felt like the only way we could come to a resolution was a full refund we just took the standpoint that the customer has to have some responsibility if they are provided information and have the ability to read and understand something their neglect for not doing it isnt on our shoulders
1159006 if we have repeated complaints that say exactly the same thing and the company responds by saying
1159007 sometimes its cut and dry and other times you really have to investigate and i dont think they investigated enough

1159044 has confirmed his complete desire to finish with rugby league to switch over to union
1159045 hell be at the very least in the stadium or better on the team sheet for fridays friendly against hyeres
1159046 our problem is is williams under contract with another rugby union side the answer is no therefore hes free to join with whoever he wants he doesnt need a letter to leave
1159047 very serene very determined to make his entry into rugby union
1159048 that seems to be a closed chapter in his career
1159049 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
1159050 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
1159051 there is a rule in the french competition that a player cannot finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
1159052 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract

1159068 just as the berlin wall once fell when the east germans came together and demanded their freedom we too will give those living in closed societies the technology to take down the great firewall that separates them from the rest of the world

1159131 when you speak to those who have been charged with buying the water they concede there was no plan they just bought the cheapest water they could which was buying air space in dams it did not actually buy water at this time
1159132 for the first time and after years of inaction the environment will have an entitlement as governments allocate water

1159135 the benefit is now not only can you take advantage of resource pools
1159136 we were surprised to learn that such a high proportion of parents heavily rely on verbal agreements to ensure their childrens online activities are safe and legal
1159137 in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes
1159138 i am also setting aside my interest in employment in student affairs particularly residence life
1159139 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the west australian liberal party
1159140 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think that i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of parliament and to the liberal party to make sure that we have every opportunity to win government at that election
1159141 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as the leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record
1159142 let me put it to you this way i have formed a view a very strong view that we have a far better chance of election victory if theres a change
1159143 theres no doubt that those issues have made it difficult for us as a political party to obtain the clear air that we need to focus on the issues that we need to focus on i acknowledge and recognise that
1159144 do those issues mean that i am incapable or unfit to lead the state of wa i dont think so however i have an obligation to the liberal party and i think a broader obligation to the people of wa to do everything i can to rid them of this rotten government
1159145 ive made mistakes and done things which in hindsight i had never have done
1159146 ive never kicked a quokka i hasten to add and ive got to say thats probably the only regret is the way that most scurrilous useless piece of information was bandied around as if it was a truism thats about the only thing
1159147 all the other stuff youve got to accept it you know youre in public office youre subject to public scrutiny and no one could ever accuse of me of attempting to shoot the messenger
1159148 although if i had found a few people on that day i mightve but anyway time life marches on
1159149 we always planned to run this election on the basis of policy of making sure that we were making all the right provisions for the future of the public of wa
1159150 that wont change whoever the liberal party throw up is a choice for them troy buswell obviously had his difficulties and so does colin barnett but well wait and see
1159151 its a matter now for the liberal party to decide who they want to lead them
1159152 chose a workforce that he knew or suspected would be pliable and bullied them if they complained
1159153 the employees were given contracts of employment of considerable complexity governing matters totally irrelevant such as ownership of inventions and the like not inadvertently but as part of a general tactic by the employer to intimidate
1159154 responses to queries made by employees as to their rates of pay were met by aggressive legally orientated and threatening correspondence

1159158 you might think it is advantageous to have a precise rule
1159159 but if you have a precise rule it also makes it possible to design something that is precisely just outside the rule
1159160 therefore the more principles based approach under ifrs and what we have under uk generally accepted accounting principles makes it much more difficult to design something in such a way that it is off balance sheet
1159161 you could not rely on a specific rule to give you a yes or no answer
1159162 its more difficult more work but on balance gives a more realistic answer of whats going on

1159165 let me make my position very clear obesity is the result of a prolonged small positive energy surplus with fat storage as the result
1159166 the cholesterol receptor the discovery of which earned brown and goldstein the nobel prize is not mentioned nor are the statin drugs that arose from this discovery the statin class of drugs has been very important in reducing the deaths from heart disease
1159167 here take 20 calories of anything on in that cabinet and call me in the morning
1159168 let me make my position very clear obesity is the result of a prolonged small positive energy surplus with fat storage as the result an energy deficit produces weight loss and tips the balance in the opposite direction
1159169 since we dont fully understand the causes of obesity we should take the patients responsibility out of it
1159170 its not your fault you neednt take any responsibility for your condition heres a prescription good luck next patient
1159171 pharmacological alternatives are thoroughly explored with individual chapters on sibutramine and orlistat both fda approved and pramlintide currently approved in europe
1159172 even if the evidence did not favor it evolution it would still be the best theory available
1159173 we take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs in spite of its failure to fulfill many of its extravagant proises sic of health and life in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just so stories because we have a prior commitment a commitment to materialism it is not that the methods of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation for the phenomenal world but on the contrary that we are forced by our a priori commitment to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations no matter how counter intuitive no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated moreover the materialism is absolute for we cannot allow a divine foot in the door
1159174 the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just so stories because we have made a prior commitment
1159175 the situation you describe has been addressed in the literature its one of the reasons it is easy to lose weight early on during a diet and more difficult later as dieters lose weight they reduce their energy expenditure making it more of a chore to create the deficit needed to continue to lose
1159176 we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue and then when we are finally proved wrong imprudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right intellectually it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality usually on a battlefield
1159177 if we take in a large load of carbohydrate we dont have the enzymes we need to dispose of the carbs quickly so they remain in the blood as sugar a little longer giving a glucose tolerance test reading that looks like that of one with glucose intolerance or outright diabetes

1159181 further experiments by lifson gordon and mcclintock showed that total daily co2 production could be measured from the differential elimination of water labeled with stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen after the administration of doubly labeled water 2h218o the labeled hydrogen 2h2 would be eliminated as water 2h2o corresponding to water output whereas the oxygen isotope would be eliminated as water h218o and as expired carbon dioxide c18o2 by measuring the difference between the elimination rates of labeled oxygen and hydrogen the carbon dioxide production rate can be calculated the carbon dioxide production rate is converted into energy expenditure by knowing the respiratory quotient rq of the food ingested during the observation period
1159182 bray claims that insulin has been shown to be necessary for obesity but it is not sufficient
1159183 there are many kinds of obesity and only some depend on diet composition genetic factors play a role as do the contributions of other environmental agents
1159184 low fat diets are as efficacious as other weight reducing diets for achieving sustained weight loss

1159222 its another example of judges not following guidelines and its something we have to look into
1159223 the judge was used as an excuse for probation that the investigators were very aggressive i dont think that should be a defense i think we should be in fact very aggressive in pursuing these investigations
1159224 were taught various techniques on how to conduct ourselves properly so we can make sure that the person were talking to has a genuine predisposition to actually engage in this type of behavior and that doesnt come from us were basically making sure that it comes from them
1159225 they said the victim was not a victim the reason why of course we put agents or detectives online is because we are not going to subject a child to basically going through what were trying to protect them from in the first place
1159226 it was a pain at first because i couldnt get into my driveway
1159227 and i was afraid about my daughter falling into the wooden parts
1159228 its a very awesome thing that the community has gotten together to get this done mainly for the kids and it looks better it looks cleaner

1159232 if the employer work unit is really on the verge of bankruptcy and is undergoing a legalised procedure of reformation or if there is an extremely severe difficulty in the conditions of management and production and therefore there exists a genuine necessity to down size then it is permissible to fire employees
1159233 under one of the following circumstances if there is the need to reduce the number of employees by more than 20 or less than 20 but more than 10 percent of the total proportion of workers in the enterprise the employer work unit must notify the union or the workforce as a whole 30 days in advance and after receiving advice from the union or the workforce the plan to fire employees must be reported to the labour administrative department and only after that can employees be fired this only apply when after the switching of production mode in the enterprise a significant technological innovation or an adjustment in the style of management and after changing the labour contracts there is still the need to reduce employee numbers
1159234 there is an extremely severe difficulty in the conditions of production and management
1159235 extremely severe difficulties in the conditions of production and management
1159236 youd think that they would have built a visitors centre by now
1159237 miguel tarssas he was a life technician here maintaining the station thats the line the tribe is taking anyway
1159238 he wouldnt have even had a cause to approach the towers
1159239 withheld as a matter of course all we got were preliminaries thats all the tribe would release if they had anything definitive we wouldnt have been called in
1159240 no external marks no wounds scratches bleeding or bruising in short nothing external whatever killed him killed him from the inside
1159241 without the full results theres no way to tell hatton managed to dig up his medical file logged with an obscure medical centre in jamenta there was nothing physically wrong with him he was reasonably young at fifty seven and in full health physically fit no long term conditions
1159242 i know only theres something about this that doesnt add up
1159243 it would explain why the tribe invited us what i dont understand is why he left the tech station at all what made him come over here to the towers
1159244 nobody else up here the tribes make sure of that their surveillance here is something to be believed theyre probably watching us now something made him leave the tech station and wander over to the old man
1159245 ive no idea he wouldnt have been carrying a middleman the tribal report stated that he only had his coolant suit and water flask
1159246 theyve deployed an orbital to watch us so far its refusing all attempts at communication somethings really spooked them
1159247 my guess is that tarssas death rattled them they cant work out why a supposedly healthy man would just keel over and die like that
1159248 i cant believe that they dont on the other hand if they do know they wouldnt have asked us up here they would have expected us to find out this place would have been sealed
1159249 such a development makes any claim on the reserve worthless doesnt it
1159250 from now on we keep one eye on the desert if they want us out of here theyll waste no time they may even be here already
1159251 possibly most of the files are protected as you might expect ive been running into tribal code barriers all morning all i managed to decode was a scrap of video a section of surveillance footage
1159252 it appears that he was coming back from south spire
1159253 but thats way over the other side of the reserve
1159254 so the old man was simply the death site is it possible that tarssas was injured elsewhere
1159255 i found a communiqu tarssas was out at south spire for a reason dont ask me what that reason was but somebody told him told to go out there
1159256 he was only supposed to be here for two days ive seen his clearance he wasnt qualified to examine the towers he didnt even hold the relevant pass to approach them
1159257 nevertheless somebody ordered him out there on his own in the middle of the day
1159258 if the union had ordered someone with tarssas credentials out to south spire then there must have been something out there worth breaking union protocol for he was sent simply because he was already on site
1159259 do you think it might have been a claim attempt
1159260 ill have to go out there and take a look for myself
1159261 something made them send him out there something made them order a low ranking technician across the reserve a sacred reserve a space that not even the tribal elders can visit without committee representation i want to know what it was
1159262 the tribal representatives will be here in an hour probably less
1159263 then well play for time if a call comes in dont answer well claim interference electromagnetic distortion anything to get us a few more hours
1159264 they can think what they like it wont change anything
1159265 youre dehydrated youre suffering from heat stroke the coolant suit saved you
1159266 they havent tried to enter yet theyre probably giving us time to comply theyve been there for an hour but weve had no communication from the tribe
1159267 we wont the situation is untenable they know that better to leave now before we cause a diplomatic incident
1159268 as a matter of course why do you think the towers migrated
1159269 ive no idea what matters now is what the union believes
1159270 well what did you expect todd youve been monkeying around all year and as for revising for your exams well when did you do that
1159271 a scientist told me that if you make instant coffee in the micro wave you go back in time just a little bit mind

1159275 bollywood dancing as as different from classical dance as line dancing
1159276 teaching helps me master the dance so sometimes teaching is almost a selfish endeavor watching people getting into their own body awareness through dance and become empowered because of something ive taught them is really a priceless gift you receive as a teacher people feel empowered because theyve accomplished something difficult something they didnt think the could do at all let alone do well
1159277 this is my souls work im 100 committed to it even though being a business owner and a full time teacher is new to me and scary
1159278 heres this most intimate and strong part of me and now i have to market it ugh i mean i can market others super well but marketing myself is much harder

1159282 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
1159283 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
1159284 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
1159285 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
1159286 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
1159287 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security

1159290 given that we believe the double digit declines in advertising are now priced in that the risks surrounding pension funding have been mitigated and management is aggressively tackling costs we believe that there is little near term downside in the stock
1159291 while further cost cuts are now likely the near term investment case is driven by potential for takeover as opposed to fundamentals which appear to be declining

1159361 our commitment to ensure the safety of every child who rides on a school bus in ohio is one of the most valuable services the ohio state highway patrol provides to the public each year
1159362 we take this responsibility extremely seriously and i know that when an ohio school bus receives a safety decal from the patrol that the children who ride that bus are in one of the safest vehicles in which they can travel
1159363 this is one of my biggest fears participating in these runs sometimes they ride a little too close
1159364 sometimes the parents drop them off in this area thinking its a babysitting facility and its not
1159365 for some reason those individuals who do drugs think its their safe haven

1159373 labview offers the shortest path to apply these technologies through parallel programming while providing users the flexibility to easily define their solution using sophisticated algorithms
1159374 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1159375 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1159376 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1159377 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1159378 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1159379 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1159380 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1159381 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1159382 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1159383 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1159384 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1159385 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1159386 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1159387 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1159388 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1159389 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1159390 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1159391 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1159392 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1159393 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1159394 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1159395 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1159396 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1159397 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1159398 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1159399 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1159400 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1159401 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1159402 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1159403 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1159404 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1159405 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1159406 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1159407 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1159408 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1159409 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1159410 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1159411 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1159412 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1159413 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1159414 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1159415 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1159416 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1159417 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1159418 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1159419 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1159420 who are open to doing something on the production side
1159421 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1159422 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1159423 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1159424 the blackman is the original man from him came all brown yellow red and white people by using a special method of birth control law the blackman was able to produce the white race this method of birth control was developed by a black scientist known as yakub who envisioned making and teaching a nation of people who would be diametrically opposed to the original people a race of people who would one day rule the original people and the earth for a period of 6 000 years yakub promised his followers that he would graft a nation from his own people and he would teach them how to rule his people through a system of tricks and lies whereby they use deceit to divide and conquer and break the unity of the darker people put one brother against another and then act as mediators and rule both sides
1159425 in reality islam is a revolutionary ideology and programme which seeks to alter the social order of the whole world and rebuild it in conformity with its own tenets and ideals muslim is the title of that international revolutionary party organized by islam to carry into effect its revolutionary programme and jihad refers to that revolutionary struggle and utmost exertion which the islamic party brings into play to achieve this objective
1159426 but i know thine abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy raging against me
1159427 the secret of a long life is to smile four times more than before
1159428 i will not buy the rest of your goods for the shadow of the smoke
1159429 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1159430 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1159431 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1159432 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1159433 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1159434 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1159435 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1159436 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1159437 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1159438 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1159439 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1159440 its been 30 years since he saved her from drowning 23 years since they sailed away together and had a son 11 years since they quit pirating and settled in shipwreck cove 10 years since el
1159441 i went on to explain i did not feel clients understood the term
1159442 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1159443 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1159444 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1159445 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1159446 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1159447 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1159448 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1159449 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1159450 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1159451 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1159452 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1159453 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1159454 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1159455 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1159456 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1159457 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1159458 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1159459 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1159460 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1159461 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1159462 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1159463 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1159464 the teleclass will cover the basics of getting started as a real estate virtual assistant scheduled topics include
1159465 you have to say given the things that have been afforded to collingwood and mick malthouse they havent got the job done
1159466 no expense has been foresaken they have the lexus centre they go off for their altitude training they have the best of everything whatever they want more than any other club
1159467 if you weigh everything up like in a business you really have to question whether they have got the job done
1159468 maybe were expecting too much of this group at this stage i dont know
1159469 but they probably havent lived up to expectations at this point of the season
1159470 they go very wide and short they have no long runners and there is no flair in the midfield
1159471 i dont think micks done anything to spice them up a bit
1159472 collingwood does work hard they play a bash and crash style and have a terrific workrate and to their credit they have fashioned some deserved wins
1159473 but there are not many games they kick easy goals every game is hard work
1159474 you just cant sustain that style of game for 22 weeks
1159475 having looked at the team from the outside i think defensively collingwood is very light on
1159476 they work their butts off to create goals but then give up easy ones at the other end they definitely cant handle big bodies defensively
1159477 hes definitely improving in what he needs to do and thats all we can ask of him so hopefully he might get an opportunity
1159478 certainly with the performances hes been able to put together for the magpies hes put his name up there
1159479 thats something craigy and the leadership group will have to sit down and work out
1159480 hopefully for grahams sake its something thats going to hold him in good stead for the rest of his career
1159481 weve had a bit of a chat we always have a bit of a chat and the reality is grahams a bit of a leader with the younger players as well so its important to him to uphold the right standards
1159482 you dont penalise the team because one bloke has been a d head
1159483 how should collingwood handle alan didak in light of the heath shaw affair
1159484 once we saw the footage we thought ok this could be interesting
1159485 given we saw how much he extended it yes it is a good result
1159486 having said that it would have been better if it was just a corkie
1159487 if you just look at the main stage and say heres what the festival is about youre missing most of the festival
1159488 one of the things weve learned is that certain acts belong on certain stages you wouldnt put a chamber music ensemble in a football stadium were presenting more intimate acts and straight ahead bands in the rep were using the imax theatre for the smith dobson stage because those bands need a quieter and more intimate space
1159489 people would say the musics over at 8 or 9 what do i do now
1159490 its a chance to show off what a great town san jose can be at night
1159491 weve got almost 1 000 volunteers and we want to keep this a community event were expecting 100 000 people so its pretty well attended if we spent a lot of money to get a big name act would it make the festival that much more enjoyable i dont know if it would
1159492 monterey and the san francisco jazz festival do that kind of thing really well were a very different event in a lot of ways
1159493 hates america but loves the unions wal mart has worked so hard to keep out of it stores
1159494 the application was made after police received the results of ongoing forensic inquiries shortly before 6pm
1159495 another application will be made to the court over the next few days for the withdrawal of all charges
1159496 detectives are encouraging children and young people to avoid walking or travelling alone especially if going to and from school
1159497 when possible children and young people should also use busier roads and streets or paths where other people are likely to be and avoid back lanes and short cuts through isolated areas
1159498 for these people addicted to these drugs theyre seeking it and theres a market for people who want to open an illegitimate clinic
1159499 historically theres been a problem of it here in new orleans i think the storm made many of them go away but some have gone and re established in the baton rouge and lafayette areas
1159500 remember when you heard it you didnt think about it you opened up your ears and listened felt it smashing through the pretense through scabs of inhibition that the world stitched to your shoulder like a mission it echoed like lips meeting and it fluctuated violently filled your heart and lungs up with redemption kind of like an ending but more like a beginning ill be with you now youre so much older so mature and insecure youve grown out of yourself and into something else oh you crazy rebel tell me is this what you want to be if you say youll just scream this in defiance from the bottom of your lungs i will be with you everywhere you go every little thing you do our love is here to stay even when the skies are gray what ever happened to the rocknroll in your eyes what ever happened to the rocknroll in your eyes oh i know its somewhere in there underneath your veail of lies theyre crazy eardrums are like elephants they dont forget the things they hear and veins still carry fragments of the things fed to your ear what ever happened to the rocknroll in your eyes what ever happened to the rocknroll in your eyes oh i know its somewhere in there underneath your veail of lies oh why do you hide them your rocknroll eyes my baby
1159501 you wake from the dirt and the grime stretch your fractured pretzel spine out to take your revenge for the crime filled with fire and finally mine

1159504 weve had enough of these blokes letting us down at the collingwood football club
1159505 theyre not five year olds now theyre grown men we are angry we are furious weve had enough the public has had enough
1159506 personally the shaw brothers know better than anybody their sister was nearly killed in a car accident shes had to fight for her life
1159507 there is no excuse and were sick and tired of this behaviour
1159508 we want to make sure hes put up here were going to put him up wednesday and the normal midweek one media conference and hes definitely going to play on saturday night
1159509 we want him to be in the papers the next two or three days on talkback radio hes going to be under the pump and hes got to respond hes let us down im not happy at all
1159510 how should collingwood handle alan didak in light of the heath shaw affair
1159511 how much more money can we screw out of these idiots
1159512 about one in five voters who supported clinton in the democratic primaries tell pollsters that they are not voting for obama
1159513 it is entirely a matter for her and her family to decide whether they will make a comment
1159514 i am sure you are aware that we have received and continue to receive numerous requests for public records in connection with this matter we have provided such records to date
1159515 office should continue to provide documents as requested by the public
1159516 it would be helpful if in the future you would provide a direct communication to your office when you initiate an investigation and would request that records are not released until further notice
1159517 communicating to the citys law department its intention to initiate an investigation would be inconsistent with the offices role and statutory responsibilities and accordingly we will not do so
1159518 the legal rules applicable to the conduct of this offices investigations do not alter the publics right of access to public information or your legal and ethical responsibility to provide access
1159519 brings a whole host of different ingredients to the table
1159520 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha
1159521 we believe he is very well respected both in industry and in the investor community
1159522 from motorolas perspective we expect this will improve the companys competitive positioning
1159523 ela precisa de um tempo para ela para repensar seus sentimentos e descansar
1159524 when the democrats took control of congress in 2007 and oil was 50 a barrel and corn 2 a bushel house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader harry reid promised an energy plan were still waiting for it today crude oil is 134 and corn is 6 50 its pretty clear whos to blame congress in fact house and senate democrats have obstructed any progress in america s fight to regain some semblance of energy independence
1159525 i am delighted and greatly encouraged to see the increase in numbers of learners achieving our qualifications and the steady growth in pass rates
1159526 these results show continuing strong achievements in what is a robust scottish education system
1159527 as scotlands young people continue to aim high and achieve so much we can look to a future where scotland is smarter and we can compete on equal terms with the rest of the world even in these difficult economic times
1159528 the continuing healthy uptake and attainment in science and modern languages by our young people demonstrates the continued drive to make scotland a more competitive place to do business
1159529 its vital for students to call the helpline as soon as they can as colleges and universities make their final selections once the results are out
1159530 we can discuss the options and look at the different learning pathways and routes that are available to help the caller make an informed career choice that is right for them
1159531 i dont want to embarrass any other catcher by comparing him to johnny bench
1159532 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid said resident erick filleur who was jolted out of his sleep by the storm
1159533 my wife was watching television then suddenly my daughter cried out my shutters exploded and part of our roof flew off
1159534 the windows of my apartment suddenly blew up i lay down on the ground i just thought i was going to die said mustapha rbide one of the towns 16 000 residents
1159535 in my life i have never been afraid of anything
1159536 those who know me will know that i am not a coward i have never been afraid of anything i was willing to die for this country and i am prepared to die for it

1159541 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1159542 there are lots of reasons why we picked australia first of all australia is one of the more established travel e commerce markets in the region so in terms of market development its a no brainer
1159543 we really want to have a pan asia pacific footprint also since we launched wego weve seen 30 growth from australia traffic for no reason it has all been organic growth so we thought the marketplace must be ready
1159544 the australian dollar is still going strong and india provides a good value
1159545 the perception versus reality is vastly changing and with the middle class emerging it is changing this great destination
1159546 there is still more education needed for travel agents to be comfortable to sell the destination
1159547 it is not a destination for the faint hearted but more for the adventurous travellers it is an awe inspiring journey
1159548 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
1159549 the focus within qantas for the past five years has been more about how to reduce costs rather than how to improve quality and as a consequence these problems will pop up more regularly
1159550 adventure travel continues to increase in popularity as travellers seek new experiences and to make the most of a limited amount of holiday time
1159551 the strength of the australian dollar near full employment and the availability of cheap international airfares are also contributing to the healthy growth in this sector
1159552 our partnership with intrepid will allow us to build our presence in this specialised area in addition to providing adventure travellers with an improved service offering built around flight centre and intrepids respective strengths
1159553 this joint venture will fast track the intrepid retail divisions growth and will deliver additional expertise knowledge and retail best practice to the business

1159582 the great value of our dollar has seen us car rental rates drop dramatically in recent months giving holidaymakers cheaper travel and greater freedom to move around as they wish rather than being tied to pre booked itineraries
1159583 its now possible in california for instance thats our biggest market in the usa to pick up a rental car for two people from as little as au 257 a week
1159584 and because our rates are quoted in australian dollars and are based on pre paying here before departure it guarantees not just great value but that a clients car is ready for them the moment they arrive

1159592 consists of three early 17th century ad sites on the islands of efate lelepa and artok associated with the life and death of the last paramount chief or roi mata of what is now central vanuatu
1159593 the property includes roi matas residence the site of his death and roi matas mass burial site it is closely associated with the oral traditions surrounding the chief and the moral values he espoused
1159594 the site reflects the convergence between oral tradition and archaeology and bears witness to the persistence of roi matas social reforms and conflict resolution still relevant to the people of the region

1159603 the industry is becoming increasingly competitive at a time where there is great economic anxiety but radius is pursuing a clear strategy and is facing up to the challenges
1159604 in both the short and medium term we are laser focused on maintaining and expanding our leading position
1159605 for the long term we are working closely with our board of directors to actively cultivate growth and value enhancement on a global basis that make strategic and commercial sense
1159606 the past year has been a watershed for us both in terms of infrastructure development and successful sales and we feel that 2008 2009 is going to be a banner year
1159607 i anticipate that the marketplace will continue to rapidly impose new business standards that will dramatically impact the way travel is managed but we will continue to accelerate our momentum and enhance our delivery of innovative world class local and multinational travel management services that meets the needs of our agencies customers
1159608 to empower illiterate and malnourished children reduce poverty and promote culturally and ecologically sensitive sustainable development
1159609 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
1159610 our belief that karadzic is different that he is a monster and nothing like us
1159611 its an invented story and no one ought to believe it
1159612 we were no longer able to burn our rubbish so we thought the best policy was not to produce any in the first place
1159613 i was working when the scheme started and found myself spending my lunch break dealing with our rubbish
1159614 it took ages to sort everything into different types but it comes naturally now
1159615 were still some way from reaching our zero waste goal but the difference is amazing compared with a few years ago
1159616 i cant say with absolute confidence that we will reach the target but were doing our best to make it happen
1159617 we still have opponents particularly because almost everything has to be washed
1159618 all we can do is talk to the doubters and explain why what theyre doing is so important i think consciousness is growing that this is a good thing that its not just the right thing to do but the only thing to do
1159619 he would step in and regulate the risk taking city
1159620 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1159621 the costs of children left fatherless of men behaving badly are borne by us all
1159622 i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
1159623 the report prepared for the court paints a picture of a man in significant physical and mental decline there is a clear diagnosis of dementia setting in
1159624 it is a progressive condition and ultimately he will need 24 hour care i am deeply conscious there has been a death here but this man is very unwell
1159625 unnecessary printing of emails multiple copies single sided printing and the sending of massive documents to the printer which are unlikely to be read are just some of the regular scenarios lived out by businesses every day
1159626 most offices will find they can reduce waste costs by around 20 through simple no or low cost actions measures such as double sided or multiple page printing and recycling instead of paying for disposal can really help
1159627 4 is an average but weve found some manufacturing companies can save as much as 10 of their turnover
1159628 we should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet
1159629 we think the bulk of the effort in the coming months is going to come from the divestment of non core assets
1159630 we have identified the list we have appointed investment bankers
1159631 most of the commercial activities were still able to grow underlying revenue but we observe that the environment is becoming more difficult on different fronts
1159632 oh my god i saw a man carrying a girl
1159633 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games
1159634 i was having breakfast at about 8am when i heard two or three loud bangs they sounded like a car backfiring so i didnt pay much attention until later when i heard some police had been killed
1159635 ahead of the olympics it is a very powerful symbolic attack because security in xinjiang is at an all time high
1159636 theres an independence movement but i dont expect it to succeed and dont expect many people will want to take part because they expect it to fail and know the result will be more repression
1159637 subjected to a barrage of mailings phone calls and emails
1159638 the beautiful but narrow 30 mile drive along the edge of the yorkshire dales from the m6 to skipton every lay by along the a65 except two will be closed as they dont meet new eu size guidelines in the past thoughtful farmers kindly caravanners and hgv drivers have pulled in to let motorists pass were worried about accidents due to impatience so dont fret relax and enjoy the scenery there will be fewer places where the police can safely pull you in for speeding were that not all but impossible because of tractors caravans and trucks
1159639 one had visions of boriss blond bonce floating orpheus style out to sea
1159640 after mughniyehs assassination the president apparently stripped shawkat of many of his powers
1159641 suleiman would have been involved in that process and it was known that shawkat hated suleiman
1159642 the major issue now facing syria is its relationship with iran and hizbullah and how it can reconcile that with talking to israel
1159643 the assassination means there is a power struggle going on in syria and it most probably concerns iran people like this dont just die unless something is going on
1159644 confronted with the fact that madeleines dna was gathered from behind the sofa and from the boot of the vehicle and analysed by a british laboratory he said he could not explain why this would be
1159645 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1159646 lets look at the question that is being asked is there dna from madeleine on the swab it would be very simple to say yes simply because of the number of components within the result that are also in her reference sample
1159647 what we need to consider as scientists is whether the match is genuine because madeleine has deposited dna as a result of being in the car or whether madeleine merely appears to match the result by chance
1159648 we cannot answer the question is the match genuine or is it a chance match
1159649 the search for madeleine goes on kate and gerry know there is a possibility that madeleine could be dead and could be long dead however there is absolutely no evidence that she is dead
1159650 crispin very early on saw weakness in financial services we saw the rise in food prices and were very pro agricultural commodities we also did well holding insurance companies
1159651 hypocritical and political there is a lot of noise around this things are being made up on the hoof to keep political masters happy
1159652 people want to find a scapegoat we were 0 28 short on bradford amp bingley stock that was a 1m position it is not our fault that bradford amp bingley was in trouble
1159653 investors should be starting to look further out and be expecting to make the real money some few years hence with the view that buying shares over the next nine months may feel painful but may turn out to have been not only courageous but brilliantly timed
1159654 five years ago in response to his appeal patriarch alexy ii gave his blessing to the allotment of a plot in the donskoy monastery graveyard as solzhenitsyns burial place
1159655 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1159656 he wanted to die at home and he died at home alexander isayevich lived a difficult but happy life
1159657 the death of this great man and one of the major thinkers writers and humanists of the 20th century is an irreparable loss for russia and for the world as a whole
1159658 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
1159659 oh i didnt know he had died thats sad news
1159660 he was a great man i will probably go and see him tomorrow
1159661 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1159662 this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1159663 we have to get the balance right between being a nanny state and a neglectful state
1159664 use of the word obese shuts people down they associate it with 10 tonne mums and half tonne kids we have not banned it but we have chosen not to use it theres no point giving them a letter that does not have any impact on their behaviour
1159665 i find this particular line from the government to be tiptoeing through the daffodils
1159666 the americans have gone back to using the term because its the kind of shock word that makes parents sit up and take notice its a nasty word but by god it should sound alarm bells in parents minds
1159667 i find this whole approach from the department of health a bit prissy and namby pamby
1159668 school nurses can make a real difference in helping children develop healthy habits but the government has failed to address the chronic shortage of school nurses
1159669 if ministers are serious about their plans to tackle child obesity then they should use this opportunity to really highlight the health risks it causes
1159670 unless these letters are accompanied by practical help then they will be a waste of time and resources
1159671 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1159672 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1159673 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1159674 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1159675 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1159676 the builders of ecohouses accept as a given the basic shape and dropsical proportions of the two storey suburban villa with pitched roofs end gables front porch picture windows chimneys and so forth
1159677 there is usually nothing about the ecohouse to signal that it is a new kind of energy efficient machine for living in
1159678 the slate in the roof may be recycled but with so many solar panels skylights sun tunnels and windows in it and on it theres no good reason for it being made of slate at all
1159679 as good a shape as it could be to weather the storm
1159680 august the second ate a stick of celery see its rubbish stop blogging
1159681 with mr rodgers again providing the copia and mr hammerstein providing the corn
1159682 say it loud and theres music playing say it soft and its almost like praying
1159683 i hope and i pray for hester to win just one more a
1159684 ill leave the key under the mat fix the dishwasher leave the bill on the counter and ill mail you a cheque
1159685 oh by the way dont worry about my dog spike he wont bother you but whatever you do do not under any circumstances talk to my parrot
1159686 i think that is a fair characterisation rather than a slur
1159687 if you buy the ftse you are not buying the uk economy
1159688 it is a truism that emerging markets hold up until they dont
1159689 they are largely about momentum and as long as they are going up they are doing well but when they fall they fall the furthest
1159690 the ones that became hot spots then collapsed vietnam doubled and halved shanghai tripled and then halved again the stockmarkets that didnt attract large amounts of foreign investors in the past werent subject to the same excess or capital flight
1159691 our view is that oil prices are likely to fall and they could be in for a rocky ride
1159692 hiv and aids remains a critical issue for glbt people as the epidemic continues to affect our community disproportionately particularly young people and gay and bisexual men of color we ask that the platform continue to call for robust funding of prevention care and research efforts prevention programs must be comprehensive science based and focused on the communities they are meant to serve we ask that the platform include a call for the development and implementation of a comprehensive national strategy on hiv aids
1159693 i came out as hiv positive in april as part of national day of silence i have known for just over a year now and i am a well known figure in my state and particularly in the capitol but when i approached the aso here to start connecting with them to do speaking engagements they had no funds for prevention to reach into schools it had been cut early on in the bush administration
1159694 these statements again make clear that sen mccain has a long way to go to earn the votes of those who care about hiv aids in america sadly this seeming disinterest in the epidemic is not new for sen mccain his record on aids vacillates between total disengagement and reactionary cant voters considering supporting sen mccain must demand that he take this epidemic more seriously and articulate meaningful proposals and specific commitments for dealing with it
1159695 these data among men who have sex with men point to an urgent unmet need
1159696 cyborg shes not responding to anything and shes bleeding heavily
1159697 take off her cloak and press it to the wounds
1159698 if you dont tell me ill just ask danna un
1159699 no sigh ill tell you but i swear if you tell anyone i will kill you
1159700 ok when i was little seeing as noone in my village wanted anything to do with me my parents sold me of to some scienctist that used me for some weird experiments that told me they were just practicing some
1159701 kaza you had me worried i thought someone was hurting you
1159702 i dont know i thought you were in real trouble and we are in a place full of s ranked criminals
1159703 its been awhile since i have had some of kazarus home made cooking
1159704 hey hadashi i need to see you in my room
1159705 dont call me that anymore hadashi just call me sasori i already get enough of that danna stuff from deidara
1159706 because he is my partner and partners are to sleep in the same room however zetsu and okami just sleep in the same bed thats why there is an extra bed in hidan and kakuzus room
1159707 so if i were yours and deidaras partner where would i sleep
1159708 i dont know leader would probably have us move the extra bed in here and make you sleep in that
1159709 uh yeah funny thing bout that i still have that thing were i cant sleep by myslef
1159710 then you would just have to sleep with one of us
1159711 oh yes i was wondering if you would sing that song that use to sing to all the village children
1159712 i remember that song oh how did it go um take time to realaieze that your warmth is crashing down on in that one
1159713 yeah you didnt seem happy at all before i sang and you didnt smile at all you used to smile all the time
1159714 having to pay for our rooms and having to walk in the pouring rain
1159715 yeah it went so fucking well im gonna kill you
1159716 whoever the fuck your danna is its not gonna help you
1159717 sasori fucking used his jutsu on me to make me do the splits
1159718 hadashi you havent been here for an hour and your already causing trouble
1159719 and this cloak its perfect for you kazaru but for me no i will just have to edit it
1159720 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1159721 a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and all parties are fully supportive
1159722 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made or the terms on which any such offer might be made
1159723 in our view a bid for imperial is readily affordable by either ongc or effectively the chinese government if sinopec has indeed entered the due diligence process late this ironically may give ongc more time to clear its bid it may also encourage other bidders to enter the fray such as knoc of south korea
1159724 it just shows the tragic level of authoritarianism when the police are cracking down on a group of people who simply want to get together to discuss the most important issue facing the world
1159725 dreadfully guilty that guests hard earned money has been squandered on wrapits debts
1159726 i am so shocked i dont know what to say
1159727 theres about 3 000 worth of presents on our list bought for us by family and friends and we have received none of it
1159728 there was everything from vases to rugs to coffee makers it sounds prosaic but these are the sort of things we will spend the rest of our life using and would have provided memories of who was at our wedding now we will have to ask all of our guests to get their money back set up another list and go through it all again
1159729 i feel so sorry for the couples who are caught up in this
1159730 i am utterly disgusted with what has happened it is not what getting married is supposed to be like
1159731 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
1159732 the only thing that will change their minds is public pressure
1159733 we fully appreciate that the company moving into administration has caused great stress among wrapits customers and couples
1159734 however we are confident that hsbc has at all times acted appropriately given the circumstances and any suggestion that hsbc is responsible for wrapits problems is absolutely refuted
1159735 mr owens resignation letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands
1159736 jim owen has made a significant contribution to the development of tnk bp and we regret to see him go
1159737 during two and a half years with the company jim has built a strong organisation underneath him and we expect to have a smooth transition as tnk bp considers candidates for the cfo job we wish jim all the best as he pursues new endeavours
1159738 appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing disorder itself is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour
1159739 financial markets will not and should not return to the status quo ante
1159740 little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession
1159741 the construction sector looks to be in for an extended difficult time this reinforces our belief the overall economy is more likely than not to contract in the second half of 2008
1159742 housing was again the sick man of the industry as levels of activity plunged to a record low
1159743 that said poor performance in the commercial and civil engineering sectors couldnt provide any cause for celebration
1159744 july marked an end to constructors optimism about recovery as spirits were knocked by the persistent and rapid decline in new business and activity more jobs were shed and at a faster pace than in june as pessimism about the sectors future took hold
1159745 its quite unique four generations of the gibbs family who kept everything they really did keep everything
1159746 the interesting thing about it is the range of items from the 19th century objects to lord wraxalls 20th century washing machine
1159747 he lord wraxall was a soldier so perhaps he wanted it as a souvenir
1159748 etss problem masks a more endemic massive failure of sats that runs right through the system this is vanity testing so government can feel good about whats happening in primaries and show results are improving but its expensive for primaries not trusted by secondaries and damaging for children
1159749 there is an issue wider than the problems with ets school test results are not a reliable indicator of pupil performance
1159750 we are considering a boycott but some naht members think that wouldnt be a professional response despite the strength of feeling against sats
1159751 i have sympathy with that view but if you got to the point where there is a head of steam throughout the education community against sats and the response from the government is that there will be absolutely no negotiations then eventually you come to a situation where only a very strong campaign will have an effect
1159752 tests have changed several times over the period theyve been around trying to assess standards across the system over time using these tests is of relatively little value if you want to know how a system is performing you only need to test a sample not every 11 and 14 year old in the country
1159753 it is a tragedy that hundreds of thousands will join the millions who have left primary school unable to master the basics in the 3rs basics that are the keystone of future opportunity and success
1159754 standards in our schools are rising and we do not accept that this is the result of teaching to the test
1159755 we are already trialling changes to testing which allow teachers to choose when their pupils take new single level tests
1159756 given that we believe the double digit declines in advertising are now priced in that the risks surrounding pension funding have been mitigated and management is aggressively tackling costs we believe that there is little near term downside in the stock
1159757 while further cost cuts are now likely the near term investment case is driven by potential for takeover as opposed to fundamentals which appear to be declining
1159758 explicitly believe in addressing a breach in one of societys central relationships between the top and bottom rich and poor
1159759 we have pledged to share the proceeds of growth so that government grows more slowly than the trend rate of the economy so government spending will fall as a proportion of gdp

1159768 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1159769 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1159770 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1159771 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1159772 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1159773 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1159774 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

1159790 we have tried it is very hard to get the word out
1159791 by providing a patriotic and contemplative context for the minute of silence the law plainly serves secular rather than religious purposes
1159792 the purposes of these exercises is plain to foster patriotism and provide an opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful contemplation
1159793 the argument that somehow they needed a new statute to encourage thoughtful contemplation among students is simply not true
1159794 legislators repeatedly emphasized that students could stare at their shoes think about upcoming exams think about their pets engage in other nonverbal activities during the moment of silence as well as pray if they wished
1159795 syntax error converting the varchar value visits to a column of data type int
1159796 this episode resembles in a number of ways the so called headwinds episode of the early 1990s
1159797 a significant disruption in terms of the financial sector as we have had this time associated with a short but not especially mild recession but then the really distinguishing characteristic was that the subsequent recovery from the recession got off to a quite a sluggish start that lasted for a year or two or three depending on how you read the data
1159798 i dont see those historical comparisons as being particularly compelling
1159799 were talking 30 years policymakers around the world have learned a lot since then the disruptions of the 1970s were in part a consequence of policy mistakes unlikely to be repeated
1159800 its widely recognized in central banks around the world that milton friedman was right on this issue
1159801 if you want price stability it takes disciplined monetary policy we recognize that and intend to provide that
1159802 lots of things happen once that doesnt mean that they are good guides to the future
1159803 as long as people are confident that we will provide long run low inflation and price stability some of these short run fluctuations in food and energy while they may be difficult to adjust to will not affect the longer term course of inflation we have to be careful not to squander that credibility that means that at some point were going to have to take action to reverse the interest rate declines that weve engineered beginning last fall
1159804 i understand at least in part why youre anxious i wouldnt try to talk you out of that one talk is cheap and your own experience is going to matter more two its not like we are going to observe immediately a significant acceleration of growth and a significant diminution of inflation
1159805 cheaper than getting into a rate war with a bank down the street
1159806 its hot money it can roll out as quickly as it rolls in
1159807 a person that can afford a 170 000 house does not have 34 000 in cash it just doesnt work that way
1159808 before if you could fog a mirror you got a loan now thats not the case
1159809 i dont have the hours in the day to read all the changes that come in every day
1159810 i think these new regulations are largely common sense and perhaps long overdue
1159811 why is it ok for the bank in the 11th hour to change what they had agreed to
1159812 buyers come in with confidence and once they have talked with a lending practitioner its like theyve been hit over the head with a ton of bricks
1159813 the only people who have a shot in this market are those with no house to sell who have a good income maybe two professionals and have a good down payment they can name their own ticket thats a small percentage
1159814 buyers at every level need a lot more hand holding now
1159815 now buyers are not sure they can get a loan at all
1159816 it used to be that if you had the pre approval you were good
1159817 now five days before closing you learn that the financing isnt there anymore
1159818 the seller is told the buyer cant get the financing but it isnt the buyers fault it wasnt that they werent approved they were the rules changed
1159819 brings a whole host of different ingredients to the table
1159820 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha

1159833 it reaffirms ofccps commitment to ensure compliance with the requirements of the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act and creates an excellent incentive for federal contractors to hire veterans
1159834 the g five also strengthens partnerships between ofccp and veterans groups and other agencies
1159835 nothing is more fundamental to equal employment opportunity than the opportunity to apply for a job
1159836 as more and more employers turn to the internet to locate and screen job applicants this initiative is crucial to ensuring that disabled veterans and other qualified individuals with disabilities are afforded that opportunity when an online system is used
1159837 we asked broadridge financial to doublecheck the votes it transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1159838 the independent inspector of elections certified the results of the election and yahoo accurately announced those results
1159839 yahoo did not participate in the execution of the votes and was not a party to any errors which may have been made either by a voting institution or a proxy processing intermediary acting on behalf of banks brokers and institutions
1159840 the next policy statement is unlikely to include a signal to financial markets that the fomc is prepared to raise interest rates at the next meeting on september 16
1159841 should the actual rate climb above the feds upper limit it would forestall any chance that there would be a tightening in monetary policy especially during a presidential election year

1159846 i have no doubt this campaign will give strength to many women who may be experiencing abuse now or who may do so in the future to reach out and get help
1159847 by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed
1159848 i lived my life walking on egg shells i experienced nearly all of the warning signs i was very closely controlled criticised and isolated from friends and family
1159849 i just didnt realise that these were the warning signs i didnt recognise this as domestic violence
1159850 they are good at negative campaigns they are not so good at governing
1159851 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1159852 i am deeply grateful to speaker pelosi for her gracious comments about me and my work in congress on behalf of veterans and military families
1159853 senator obama has earned the right to manage his own vice presidential selection process and out of respect to him any questions about the process should be directed to the obama campaign
1159854 and frankly i think if they want to look at me they could do it in a lot of other ways ive pretty well been out there on the public stage now for a while having been a candidate so it probably wouldnt even be necessary
1159855 new and existing companies led by students and young entrepreneurs

1159859 but it remains to be seen who was right then

1159864 yes social media and social networking is bs it isnt new or earth shattering it isnt anything already done in the past its just being done better now
1159865 it isnt social media but society technology and communication that are the lasting parts

1159867 we cant really be bothered with this even though we know that when its done well its still better than pixar
1159868 hi theres a rat in my toilet and id like someone to get rid of it
1159869 yes yes it is which is why id like to talk to animal control incidentally
1159870 there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1159871 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced

1159878 the correct calculation of the asset values and their relationship to securities or creditors claims depends on the purposes of the analyst
1159879 it is customary to eliminate intangibles in the computation of the net asset value or equity per share of common stock
1159880 the fear is that a going concern opinion can hasten the demise of an already troubled company reduce a loan officers willingness to grant a line of credit to that troubled company or increase the point spread that would be charged if that company were granted a loan auditors are placed at the center of a moral and ethical dilemma whether to issue a going concern opinion and risk escalating the financial distress of their client or not issue a going concern opinion and risk not informing interested parties of the possible failure of the company

1159888 worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow it only saps today of its joy
1159889 troubles just a storm thats gonna past tough times dont last
1159890 some people feel guilty about their anxieties and regard them as a defect of faith but they are afflictions not sins like all afflictions they are if we can so take them our share in the passion of christ
1159891 let it go and start over there aint nothin bout it you can do
1159892 when i look back on all these worries i remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life most of which had never happened
1159893 every tomorrow has two handles we can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith
1159894 this is the precept by which i have lived prepare for the worst expect the best and deal with what actually happens
1159895 the reason why worry kills more people than work is that more people worry than work
1159896 you have to see the big chunks of wetlands tearing away and floating away
1159897 theyre only floating because the dam or series of dams at tenney park back the water up into the yahara river these wetlands that were growing on peat and instead of being inundated and lost immediately floated up ever since that happened theyve been steadily eroding away
1159898 i dread going out to look after it pops up two to two and a half feet above what its supposed to be because i know what im going to see
1159899 between the wind action and the ice action things will get whittled away so its kind of like a slow death
1159900 it accelerates as it gets wider and the waves get bigger
1159901 ultimately were losing habitat that does support a wide variety of birds and other wildlife
1159902 anything we can do to lower the summertime levels will enhance the growth of the plants
1159903 and it will also reduce the loss when we have flood events because if you start at a lower elevation you have more storage so it wont rise up as high
1159904 any silt that we can catch up in this part of the watershed as opposed to having it travel freely to lake mendota has certainly got to have some sort of positive impact on the ultimate water quality
1159905 if the high water levels of the lake are eroding and increasing the width of the upper yahara river channel by 7 feet a year thats ten of acres of high quality marshland lost every year
1159906 youve got lakeshore property owners who arent pleased about flooding or damage to their shorelines and having to rip out piers before their float away
1159907 youve got boaters whove been denied a lot of recreation because of no wake orders
1159908 this could be a real historic opportunity to really have the kind of discussion that maybe wasnt occurring in the past
1159909 whose role in history was to lead his people into a perpetual dependence on the welfare state a terrible bondage of body and soul

1159924 autumnal nothing to do with leaves it is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day brown is creeping up on us take my word for it russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses deep shining ochres burnt umber and parchments of baked earth reflecting on itself and through itself filtering the light at such times perhaps coincidentally the leaves might fall somewhere
