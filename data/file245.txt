2450000 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
2450001 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
2450002 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
2450003 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
2450004 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas home prices are projected to increase 3 to 6 percent in 2009
2450005 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009
2450006 the nsc is similar to a call center that handles inbound and outbound calls but it also serves as a knowledge base center where operators upload all acquired information into the election day management platform edmp which can help in developing quick response actions
2450007 we have installed dedicated phone lines to allow the field support technicians to provide quick updates in their designated areas
2450008 we are confident that with the combined expertise of our field support technicians and the back up support of the nsc in manila we will have a smooth flow of operations in our precincts in maguindanao and consolidation and canvassing centers in shariff kabunsuan lanao del sur basilan sulu and tawi tawi
2450009 it is a totally different course to the north west 200 or the tt like a proper grand prix on roads
2450010 it has fast corners slow corners hard braking slow braking and blind apex corners its a real riders circuit and one that all real road racers enjoy
2450011 at the north west its important to have the fastest bike but you dont have to be on the quickest machine to win at the ulster
2450012 there are so many corners and so many braking points that you can ride harder at the ulster to make up for the loss of power
2450013 a place you have to love in order to go fast
2450014 the circuits suits guy as he is a rider who tries hard and to win at the ulster you have to ride hard go fast and be very exact
2450015 cameron donald is another who should go well as he has good form from the tt and is capable of really scratching on fast courses whether it be roads or on the british short circuits
2450016 ian hutchinson won in the wet last year and he is also used to hard track riding every week on the circuits which is what you really need to be doing
2450017 john mcguinness hasnt really hit it off as he would like at the grand prix but given his performances on the isle of man and the fact that he has won some races at dundrod he can never be discounted
2450018 bruce anstey has hardly raced since the tt but he has loads of talent and should weigh in with a victory or two again
2450019 ryan has got good bikes from millsport and kenny harker and you must remember that alistair seeley won on one of the millsport bikes and went well on the rest at the north west 200 so they are very competitive
2450020 when ryan has got the right bikes and gets his head right he can win races hes a good wet weather rider too which is also a bonus with the unpredictable weather at dundrod
2450021 william and michael have had a good teacher in their dad robert but they need to keep up the consistency and move onto a slightly different level to compete with the big boys in the main classes
2450022 adrian archibald is another who enjoys racing at dundrod and should do well but i suspect his days of winning are over
2450023 new blood in the form of conor cummins gary johnson and keith amor making an impression
2450024 we need new riders of that calibre to come through if road racing is to have a bright future
2450025 at the opposite end of the scale you have ian lougher who has been around for ages but is still a really good road racer and cant be counted out
2450026 some of the younger riders should just have the edge over him but its exciting that you have at least six guys capable of winning each race
2450027 we believe that quality and affordable health care is a basic right
2450028 we believe that covering all is not just a moral imperative but is necessary to making our health system workable and affordable
2450029 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2450030 demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2450031 we will work with canada and mexico to amend the north american free trade agreement so that it works better for all three north american countries
2450032 blint obviously knows nothing of photography because the 14mm ultra wide angle lens
2450033 i hurt my back at northridge throwing shot put but i just tweaked it
2450034 this year i wanted to get the school record and ive already done that i guess im doing pretty good so far
2450035 i dont know what it was but she just looked like a thrower
2450036 shes solid and muscular and is just an all around good athlete and a great competitor
2450037 i sat down with the basketball coach steve dickson and talked about it we both agreed shed be a good thrower
2450038 go to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 a brief glance at the idea of progression in english courses at tertiary level
2450039 we havent seen any signs of an explosion that would indicate sabotage but the cause will only become clear after the fire has been extinguished
2450040 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2450041 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2450042 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2450043 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2450044 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2450045 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2450046 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2450047 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2450048 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2450049 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2450050 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2450051 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2450052 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2450053 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2450054 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2450055 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2450056 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2450057 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2450058 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2450059 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2450060 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2450061 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2450062 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2450063 the parameter had been used to keep the animals in the past
2450064 we are going to open a display and sale shops in museums where cultural artifacts made i village tgd will be kept we will start from lahore museum and later expand to all
2450065 during last six years the pakistani dolls went in suitcases of our client to 40 different countries they sit in the ambassadors residences not only in islamabad but accompany them to the next and second next postings i met tgd dolls in the japanese ambassadors home in jakarta and also in the german embassy in damascus
2450066 part of the artists go where ever the dolls go
2450067 they the women are moving towards true equality and independence
2450068 but why compare it why not do something to alleviate it
2450069 there is nothing inside there used to be a grand annual mela here hindus have been coming here to shave off the heads of their sons till after the partition but no body comes anymore
2450070 large number of hindus had been visiting here before partition and there use to be a big annual mela in the month of chetar
2450071 i am paying rent to auqaf for living in this khandar
2450072 last time auqaf got the place cleaned was when indian minister hari karishan bhagat and ambassador de sharma visited the temple
2450073 mir chakar rind was a holder of jagir and commanding hordes of warriors in punjab
2450074 hundreds of non muslims used to convert to islam on the hands of muhammad ibrahim every day
2450075 it might have been built to guard against thieves and robbers
2450076 the department has not been able to repair even the gold plated pinnacle that needs immediate attention the family of the saint is actually looking after the shrine
2450077 it is taken out on the eve of annual mela that is held on march 13
2450078 the electric connection to the pumping station was provided in july 1997 now it is the responsibility of railways to operate it
2450079 on the average i used to do the business worth rupees 1500 per day when the park was newly completed and all the lantern shaped lights were illuminating but now my sale has reduced to mere four to five hundred rupees a day no body comes here after the last light
2450080 the sewerage system for the city is neither sufficient not it is working properly it needs complete overhaul the water that leaks from the under ground sewer and water supply pipes is destroying the buildings by effecting their foundations
2450081 garbage generated by 300 000 residents should be handled efficiently
2450082 i have 25 years of service with municipal committee and am being paid only rupees 2635 per month what do you expect me to do wonders
2450083 what the city really needs is a bypass so that the heavy traffic passing through the urban areas can be diverted
2450084 the fast moving traffic plying on the road is a great hazard for citizens especially the children of adjoining areas besides causing air and noise pollution
2450085 all encroachments particularly unsightly neon signs they obscure more than they highlight on the bifurcation in sadar bazaar should be removed and environs of gol mosque be cleaned
2450086 completion of 125 beds dhq hospital at 10 acres of land already acquired for the purpose should be given priority
2450087 all the great issues of small city remain unresolved and limited public resources are being sanctioned for mere show without any love for the land
2450088 there is no single authority to oversee the growth of the city having excellent rail and road links with the rest of the country and ideally suited for live stock production and agronomic industries
2450089 going from outer terminal to any place within the city is an ordeal
2450090 during day it takes lot of time and at night i have to pay as much as rupees 45 for going to tariq bin ziad colony whereas i pay only rupees seven for coming to sahiwal from my village
2450091 it is a complete market that keeps moving from one place to another as per its permanent schedule
2450092 we have buoparis businessmen from karachi to peshawar local farmers as well as people working in the market as our customers
2450093 farmers sell their live stock here and buy provisions for their homes
2450094 the small living avis can consume liquid up to eight times and solid about half of its body weight
2450095 it is muddy in rainy season and dust bin when not raining the only good thing that has happened to our town in last couple of decades is construction of a bypass which has relieved the inhabitants of heavy traffic that used to pass through the residential area day and night
2450096 rose plants grown in patoki are sent to places as far as queta
2450097 but what keep us going are commuters on the national highway who stop by and purchase flower or fruit plants for their home gardens or when we get a large order from some five star hotels or a multinationals based in lahore to provide them grown flowers plants in pots for any special event we deliver them the flowers indoor plants shrubs and even creepers in pots and the landscape experts and interior decorators arrange them for the display on the site
2450098 american alone now spend 15 billions dollars on flowers and plants per year columbia produces robust flowers in 1998 only oil surpassed flowers in columbian export revenues germans nurture special passions for roses and the country has become worlds top flower importer kenya has become a major exporter from africa
2450099 the best marketing strategy for agriculturists cum businessmen associated with flower trade in patoki is that each large nursery should specialize in particular kinds of flowers and should have brand names the farmers should switch over from traditional crops like wheat and sugarcane to flowers the government should encourage flower growers and make special arrangements for packing and shipment of delicate product by air from lahore

2450146 emancipation commemorates our forbears being freed from the horrendous evil of slavery
2450147 slavery was and is one of the most devastating symbols of the effects of sin
2450148 freedom is one of the primary signs of our nature as human beings god created us to be like him god is absolutely free he made us in his image and likeness with a soul intellect will and a body slavery was and is a lie god throughout history has revealed himself as a god who sets free israel experienced it and every people at some time or another have experienced it
2450149 since then because of the love of jesus expressed on the cross destroying the power of sin and death over us nothing can ever again keep us down nothing can degrade or demean us no matter how long it takes the power of gods love unleashed through jesus on the cross forever changed the course of history that is what paul is so ecstatic about our forebears and all of us through jesus christ have been set free in the concrete historical circumstance of our life in this land and throughout the region
2450150 to be free from selfishness means being able to love others by serving them even to the point of self sacrifice being free to develop our gifts means helping others develop themselves in spite of all this we yearn to be free free to let go of relationships or of things we may be addicted to for example drugs alcohol lying stealing laziness free to commit ourselves to family to work hard to admit mistakes free to be able to ask for help free to tolerate and to listen to other peoples opinions free to embrace a bigger world than ourselves free to admit that we once were in slavery as a people though i am not sure that we admit that
2450151 if we do not know and do not remember our history and learn from it we are bound to repeat it
2450152 tuvieron que adorarse a veces en el secreto ocultando como hac an algo mal pero estamos libres ahora separar nuestro religioso vemos para intentar y ganar a la gente a l adorarse abiertamente y predicar el evangelio dondequiera que deseemos a
2450153 emancipaci n ha dado a iglesia la libertad mucha para ejercitar el su ministerio en las bahamas
2450154 compartimos en su imagen y somos el pice alto de la creaci n
2450155 hay un paso en el cap tulo 5 de galatians que nos dice que
2450156 ahora a veces mucha gente en el mundo occidental y en pa ses como las bahamas toma esa libertad para concedido
2450157 alguna gente piensa que porque ella tiene la derecha de hacer cosas realmente no importa lo que l lo hace
2450158 a ellos no es ning n reparto grande especialmente cuando ha estado siempre all para usted
2450159 aunque debemos agradecer a dios por el progreso que hemos hecho como raza y como pa s nosotros debe trabajar en la supresi n de los efectos residuales de la esclavitud en nuestra gente
2450160 parte de la rutina auxiliar era entrenar a la gente negra para odiarse y tan todav a hay muchos negros que son inc modos con su piel
2450161 por otra parte la parte de emancipaci n estaba no s lo liberar los esclavos pero liberar sus amos tambi n
2450162 no podr amos adorar como lo hacemos hoy y no podr amos vivir como hacemos ni podr amos nosotros ir los lugares que lo hacemos pero todav a esclavizan algunos de nosotros
2450163 emancipaci n conmemora nuestro se abstiene de ser liberado del mal horrendo de la esclavitud
2450164 esclavitud era y es uno de los s mbolos m s devastadores de los efectos del pecado
2450165 libertad es una de las muestras primarias de nuestra naturaleza como seres humanos
2450166 en todas estas cosas que conquistamos de forma aplastante a trav s de l que nos am
2450167 desde entonces debido a el amor de jes s expres en la cruz destruyendo la energ a del pecado y la muerte sobre nosotros nada puede guardarnos siempre otra vez abajo
2450168 podemos estar libres de todo cada energ a persona o manera de la vida que nos esclavizar a
2450169 para estar libre de los medios del ego smo que pueden amar otros sirvi ndolos uniforme al punto del self sacrifice
2450170 si no sabemos y no recordamos nuestra historia y no aprendemos de ella nosotros est limitado para repetirla

2450172 lemancipazione ha dato alla chiesa la moltissima libert per esercitare il relativo ministero in bahamas
2450173 ci ripartiamo nella sua immagine e siamo lalto apex della creazione
2450174 ci un passaggio in capitolo 5 di galatians che ci dice che
2450175 ora a volte molta gente nel mondo occidentale ed in paesi come le bahamas prende quella libert per assegnato
2450176 qualche gente pensa che perch hanno la destra fare le cose realmente non importi che cosa
2450177 a loro affare grande particolarmente quando stato sempre l per voi
2450178 anche se dobbiamo ringraziare il dio per i progressi che abbiamo realizzare come corsa e come paese noi deve lavorare ad abolire gli effetti residui di slavery sulla nostra gente
2450179 la parte della procedura slave era di addestrare la gente nera per odiarsi e cos ci sono ancora molti neri che sono scomodi con la loro pelle
2450180 daltra parte facente parte emancipazione era non solo di liberare gli schiavi ma di liberare i loro padroni pure
2450181 non potremmo adorare come oggi e non potremmo vivere come facciamo n potremmo noi andare i posti che ma alcuni di noi ancora sono asserviti
2450182 lemancipazione commemora il nostro forbears essere liberato dalla malvagit horrendous di slavery
2450183 lo slavery era ed uno dei simboli pi devastating degli effetti del sin
2450184 la libert uno dei segni primari della nostra natura come esseri umani
2450185 questo che cosa st paul ci ricorda con confidenza in romans 8 35 37 39 che cosa separato noi dallamore di christ
2450186 in tutte queste cose che conquistiamo in modo schiacciante attraverso lui che li amava
2450187 da allora a causa dellamore di jesus ha espresso sulla traversa distruggente lalimentazione del sin e la morte sopra noi niente pu mantenerla mai ancora gi
2450188 possiamo essere esenti da tutto ogni alimentazione persona o modo di vivere che li asservirebbe
2450189 per essere esente dai mezzi di selfishness che possono amare altri servendole anche al punto di self sacrifice
2450190 se non conosciamo e non ci ricordiamo della nostra storia e non impariamo da esso noi limitato per ripeterlo
2450191 manchmal mu ten sie im geheimnis anbeten und sich verstecken wie sie etwas falsch taten aber jetzt wir frei sind unser frommes zu verbreiten ansehen um zu versuchen und die leute zu ihm zu gewinnen ffentlich anbeten und das evangelium zu predigen wohin wir zu w nschen
2450192 emanzipation hat der kirche viel freiheit gegeben um sein ministerium in den bahamas auszu ben
2450193 wir teilen in seinem bild und wir sind die hohe spitze der kreation
2450194 es gibt einen durchgang in galatians kapitel 5 das uns erkl rt da
2450195 jetzt manchmal nehmen viele leute in der westlichen welt und in den l ndern wie den bahamas diese freiheit f r bewilligt
2450196 w hrend wir fortfahren in einem sklave freien land zu leben
2450197 einige leute denken da weil sie das recht haben sachen zu tun es nicht wirklich ausmacht was sie
2450198 zu ihnen ist es kein grosses abkommen besonders wenn es immer dort f r sie gewesen ist
2450199 obgleich wir gott f r den fortschritt danken m ssen den wir als rennen und als land gebildet haben wir mu auf dem abschaffen der resteffekte der sklaverei auf unseren leuten arbeiten
2450200 der teil des sklavenprogramms war schwarze leute auszubilden um sich zu hassen und so es gibt noch viele schwarze die mit ihrer haut unbequem sind
2450201 einerseits war der teil emanzipation nicht nur die sklaven freizugeben aber ihre meister au erdem freizugeben
2450202 wir nicht anbeten k nnten wie wir heute und nicht leben k nnten wie wir tun noch wir gehen k nnten die pl tze die wir aber einige von uns werden noch versklavt
2450203 emanzipation unser abl t vom horrenden bel der sklaverei freigegeben werden
2450204 sklaverei war und ist sagt eins der verheerendsten symbole der effekte von s nde
2450205 freiheit ist eins der prim rzeichen unserer natur als menschen
2450206 in allen diesen sachen die wir berw ltigend durch ihn erobern der uns liebte
2450207 seit damals wegen der liebe von jesus dr ckte auf dem kreuz aus und zerst rte die energie der s nde und tod ber uns nichts kann uns berhaupt wieder unten halten
2450208 wir k nnen von alles frei sein jede energie person oder lebensart die uns versklaven w rde
2450209 von den egoismusmitteln frei sein die in der lage sind andere durch das dienen sie zu lieben gleichm ig zum punkt von self sacrifice
2450210 wenn wir nicht kennen und uns nicht an unsere geschichte erinnern und von ihr erlernen wir werden gesprungen um sie zu wiederholen
2450211 s vezes tiveram que adorar no segredo escondendo como faziam algo erradamente mas agora n s estamos livres espalhar nosso religioso vemos para tentar e para lhe ganhar os povos para adorar abertamente e para preach o gospel onde quer que n s queremos a
2450212 emancipation deu igreja a liberdade muita para exercitar seu ministry nos bahamas
2450213 n s compartilhamos em sua imagem e n s somos o apex elevado da cria o
2450214 h uma passagem no cap tulo 5 de galatians que nos diz que
2450215 agora s vezes muitos povos no mundo ocidental e nos pa ses como os bahamas fazem exame dessa liberdade para concedido
2450216 alguns povos pensam de que porque t m a direita fazer coisas n o importa realmente o que

2450249 soms moesten zij in geheim aanbidden verbergend als deden zij verkeerd iets maar nu kunnen wij om onze godsdienstige meningen uit te spreiden andere mensen te proberen en te winnen aan het openlijk te aanbidden en om het evangelie te prediken waar wij aan willen
2450250 emancipatie heeft de kerk heel wat vrijheid gegeven zijn ministerie in de bahamas uit te oefenen
2450251 wij delen in zijn beeld en wij zijn de hoge top van verwezenlijking
2450252 er is een passage in galatians hoofdstuk 5 dat ons
2450253 nu soms nemen vele mensen in de westerse wereld en in landen zoals de bahamas die vrijheid voor verleend
2450254 sommige mensen denken dat omdat zij het recht hebben dingen te doen het werkelijk van belang is wat niet zij doen
2450255 aan hen is het geen grote overeenkomst vooral wanneer het altijd daar voor u is geweest
2450256 hoewel wij god zij dank voor de vooruitgang moeten die wij als ras en als land hebben gemaakt moeten wij bij het afschaffen van de overblijvende gevolgen werken van de slavernij voor onze mensen
2450257 deel van de slavenroutine moest zwarte mensen opleiden om te haten en zodat zijn er nog vele zwarten die met hun huid ongemakkelijk zijn
2450258 enerzijds was een deel van emancipatie niet alleen eveneens vrij de slaven maar vrij hun meesters
2450259 wij niet als wij vandaag en konden niet leven als wij doen noch wij kon gaan de plaatsen dat wij maar wat van ons zijn nog verslaafd
2450260 emancipatie onze forbears herdenkt die van het horrendous kwaad van de slavernij worden bevrijd
2450261 slavernij was en is n van de het verwoesten symbolen van de gevolgen van zonde
2450262 vrijheid is n van de primaire tekens van onze aard als mensen
2450263 in al deze dingen die wij overweldigend door hem hebben veroverd die van ons
2450264 sedertdien wegens de liefde van jesus die op het kruis wordt uitgedrukt dat de macht van zonde en dood over ons vernietigt kan niets ons ooit opnieuw beperken
2450265 wij kunnen van alles vrij zijn elke macht persoon of manier van het leven die ons zouden verslaven
2450266 van ego sme vrij zijn betekent kunnend van anderen houden door hen zelfs aan het punt van zelf offer te dienen

2450306 since then because of the love of jesus expressed on the cross destroying the power of sin and death over us nothing can ever again keep us down nothing can degrade or demean us no matter how long it takes the power of gods love unleashed through jesus on the cross forever changed the course of history that is what paul is so ecstatic about our forebears and all of us through jesus christ have been set free in the concrete historical circumstance of our life in this land and throughout the region
2450307 to be free from selfishness means being able to love others by serving them even to the point of self sacrifice being free to develop our gifts means helping others develop themselves in spite of all this we yearn to be free free to let go of relationships or of things we may be addicted to for example drugs alcohol lying stealing laziness free to commit ourselves to family to work hard to admit mistakes free to be able to ask for help free to tolerate and to listen to other peoples opinions free to embrace a bigger world than ourselves free to admit that we once were in slavery as a people though i am not sure that we admit that
2450308 if we do not know and do not remember our history and learn from it we are bound to repeat it
2450309 tuvieron que adorarse a veces en el secreto ocultando como hac an algo mal pero estamos libres ahora separar nuestro religioso vemos para intentar y ganar a la gente a l adorarse abiertamente y predicar el evangelio dondequiera que deseemos a
2450310 emancipaci n ha dado a iglesia la libertad mucha para ejercitar el su ministerio en las bahamas
2450311 compartimos en su imagen y somos el pice alto de la creaci n
2450312 hay un paso en el cap tulo 5 de galatians que nos dice que
2450313 ahora a veces mucha gente en el mundo occidental y en pa ses como las bahamas toma esa libertad para concedido
2450314 alguna gente piensa que porque ella tiene la derecha de hacer cosas realmente no importa lo que l lo hace
2450315 a ellos no es ning n reparto grande especialmente cuando ha estado siempre all para usted
2450316 aunque debemos agradecer a dios por el progreso que hemos hecho como raza y como pa s nosotros debe trabajar en la supresi n de los efectos residuales de la esclavitud en nuestra gente
2450317 parte de la rutina auxiliar era entrenar a la gente negra para odiarse y tan todav a hay muchos negros que son inc modos con su piel
2450318 por otra parte la parte de emancipaci n estaba no s lo liberar los esclavos pero liberar sus amos tambi n
2450319 no podr amos adorar como lo hacemos hoy y no podr amos vivir como hacemos ni podr amos nosotros ir los lugares que lo hacemos pero todav a esclavizan algunos de nosotros
2450320 emancipaci n conmemora nuestro se abstiene de ser liberado del mal horrendo de la esclavitud
2450321 esclavitud era y es uno de los s mbolos m s devastadores de los efectos del pecado
2450322 libertad es una de las muestras primarias de nuestra naturaleza como seres humanos
2450323 en todas estas cosas que conquistamos de forma aplastante a trav s de l que nos am
2450324 desde entonces debido a el amor de jes s expres en la cruz destruyendo la energ a del pecado y la muerte sobre nosotros nada puede guardarnos siempre otra vez abajo
2450325 podemos estar libres de todo cada energ a persona o manera de la vida que nos esclavizar a
2450326 para estar libre de los medios del ego smo que pueden amar otros sirvi ndolos uniforme al punto del self sacrifice
2450327 si no sabemos y no recordamos nuestra historia y no aprendemos de ella nosotros est limitado para repetirla
2450328 a volte hanno dovuto adorare nel segreto nascondentesi come stavano facendo male qualcosa ma ora siamo liberi spargere il nostro religioso osserviamo per provare e vincere la gente ad esso adorare apertamente e predicare il gospel dovunque desiderassimo a
2450329 lemancipazione ha dato alla chiesa la moltissima libert per esercitare il relativo ministero in bahamas
2450330 ci ripartiamo nella sua immagine e siamo lalto apex della creazione
2450331 ci un passaggio in capitolo 5 di galatians che ci dice che
2450332 ora a volte molta gente nel mondo occidentale ed in paesi come le bahamas prende quella libert per assegnato
2450333 qualche gente pensa che perch hanno la destra fare le cose realmente non importi che cosa
2450334 a loro affare grande particolarmente quando stato sempre l per voi
2450335 anche se dobbiamo ringraziare il dio per i progressi che abbiamo realizzare come corsa e come paese noi deve lavorare ad abolire gli effetti residui di slavery sulla nostra gente
2450336 la parte della procedura slave era di addestrare la gente nera per odiarsi e cos ci sono ancora molti neri che sono scomodi con la loro pelle
2450337 daltra parte facente parte emancipazione era non solo di liberare gli schiavi ma di liberare i loro padroni pure
2450338 non potremmo adorare come oggi e non potremmo vivere come facciamo n potremmo noi andare i posti che ma alcuni di noi ancora sono asserviti
2450339 lemancipazione commemora il nostro forbears essere liberato dalla malvagit horrendous di slavery
2450340 lo slavery era ed uno dei simboli pi devastating degli effetti del sin
2450341 la libert uno dei segni primari della nostra natura come esseri umani
2450342 questo che cosa st paul ci ricorda con confidenza in romans 8 35 37 39 che cosa separato noi dallamore di christ
2450343 in tutte queste cose che conquistiamo in modo schiacciante attraverso lui che li amava
2450344 da allora a causa dellamore di jesus ha espresso sulla traversa distruggente lalimentazione del sin e la morte sopra noi niente pu mantenerla mai ancora gi
2450345 possiamo essere esenti da tutto ogni alimentazione persona o modo di vivere che li asservirebbe
2450346 per essere esente dai mezzi di selfishness che possono amare altri servendole anche al punto di self sacrifice
2450347 se non conosciamo e non ci ricordiamo della nostra storia e non impariamo da esso noi limitato per ripeterlo
2450348 manchmal mu ten sie im geheimnis anbeten und sich verstecken wie sie etwas falsch taten aber jetzt wir frei sind unser frommes zu verbreiten ansehen um zu versuchen und die leute zu ihm zu gewinnen ffentlich anbeten und das evangelium zu predigen wohin wir zu w nschen
2450349 emanzipation hat der kirche viel freiheit gegeben um sein ministerium in den bahamas auszu ben
2450350 wir teilen in seinem bild und wir sind die hohe spitze der kreation
2450351 es gibt einen durchgang in galatians kapitel 5 das uns erkl rt da
2450352 jetzt manchmal nehmen viele leute in der westlichen welt und in den l ndern wie den bahamas diese freiheit f r bewilligt
2450353 w hrend wir fortfahren in einem sklave freien land zu leben
2450354 einige leute denken da weil sie das recht haben sachen zu tun es nicht wirklich ausmacht was sie
2450355 zu ihnen ist es kein grosses abkommen besonders wenn es immer dort f r sie gewesen ist
2450356 obgleich wir gott f r den fortschritt danken m ssen den wir als rennen und als land gebildet haben wir mu auf dem abschaffen der resteffekte der sklaverei auf unseren leuten arbeiten
2450357 der teil des sklavenprogramms war schwarze leute auszubilden um sich zu hassen und so es gibt noch viele schwarze die mit ihrer haut unbequem sind
2450358 einerseits war der teil emanzipation nicht nur die sklaven freizugeben aber ihre meister au erdem freizugeben
2450359 wir nicht anbeten k nnten wie wir heute und nicht leben k nnten wie wir tun noch wir gehen k nnten die pl tze die wir aber einige von uns werden noch versklavt
2450360 emanzipation unser abl t vom horrenden bel der sklaverei freigegeben werden
2450361 sklaverei war und ist sagt eins der verheerendsten symbole der effekte von s nde
2450362 freiheit ist eins der prim rzeichen unserer natur als menschen
2450363 in allen diesen sachen die wir berw ltigend durch ihn erobern der uns liebte
2450364 seit damals wegen der liebe von jesus dr ckte auf dem kreuz aus und zerst rte die energie der s nde und tod ber uns nichts kann uns berhaupt wieder unten halten
2450365 wir k nnen von alles frei sein jede energie person oder lebensart die uns versklaven w rde
2450366 von den egoismusmitteln frei sein die in der lage sind andere durch das dienen sie zu lieben gleichm ig zum punkt von self sacrifice
2450367 wenn wir nicht kennen und uns nicht an unsere geschichte erinnern und von ihr erlernen wir werden gesprungen um sie zu wiederholen
2450368 s vezes tiveram que adorar no segredo escondendo como faziam algo erradamente mas agora n s estamos livres espalhar nosso religioso vemos para tentar e para lhe ganhar os povos para adorar abertamente e para preach o gospel onde quer que n s queremos a
2450369 emancipation deu igreja a liberdade muita para exercitar seu ministry nos bahamas

2450463 the tigers dont wait around for the winter meetings when all the owners and agents get involved
2450464 we got sheffield early last year and now we got renteria right away
2450465 i think this was a good move because renteria is a great player who is a winner with a championship under his belt
2450466 we were able to address our biggest need heading into the winter with one of the best shortstops in the game
2450467 we gave up a couple of good players but in order to acquire a player like edgar we knew we had to give up some talent

2450474 this is going to be a dramatically different look both in terms of substance and perception of the yankees dynasty
2450475 icons have left and there is going to be a very potent team but its going to have to regroup not as a favorite
2450476 we were very disappointed that scott boras would try to upstage our premier baseball event of the season with his announcement
2450477 there was no reason to make an announcement last night other than to try to put his selfish interests and that of one individual player above the overall good of the game
2450478 i could have handled this situation better and for that i am truly sorry

2450492 we were very disappointed that scott boras would try to upstage our premier baseball event of the season with his announcement
2450493 there was no reason to make an announcement last night other than to try to put his selfish interests and that of one individual player above the overall good of the game
2450494 last night and today belong to the boston red sox who should be celebrated for their achievement and to the colorado rockies who made such an unbelievable run to the world series
2450495 i apologize to the boston red sox and colorado rockies and their players major league baseball and its players and baseball fans everywhere for that interference
2450496 the teams and players involved deserved to be the focus of the evening and honored with the utmost respect the unfortunate result was not my intent but is solely my fault i could have handled this situation better and for that i am truly sorry
2450497 don was extremely disappointed to learn today that he wasnt the organizations choice to fill the managerial vacancy

2450514 dawkins in choosing a form of firebrand fundamentalist atheism over the discipline science is no longer the champion of reason but rather a kind of evangelical against religion
2450515 its not very long before professor dawkins cuts to the chase and explains how utterly irrational and dangerous spiritual beliefs can be indeed it was an amusing undertaking to see how long it was until dawkins plunged his dagger once more into faith
2450516 no of course not no way we arent like that at all

2450610 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2450611 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2450612 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2450613 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2450614 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2450615 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2450616 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2450617 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2450618 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2450619 my source also notes that dick cheney who was behind the forgery hated and mistrusted the agency and would not have used it for such a sensitive assignment
2450620 instead he went to doug feiths office of special plans and asked them to do the job it was feiths office that produced the letter and then surfaced it to the media in iraq unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public indeed one might argue that doug feiths office specialized in such activity

2450628 i was stopped in a shop the other day by a lady who said how great it was that more and more people are waking up to what is going on yes i agreed it was very encouraging i said however that there was another stage that needed to unfold before i would be in the least bit satisfied i said that years ago only a few years at that peoples eyes would glaze over when i talked about the hidden conspiracy for a global fourth reich now that didnt happen nearly so much as events open minds to the nature of our plight but today i said i see eyes glaze over when i talk about what needs to be done to stop the global fourth reich and while that continues to be the case the knowledge of what is happening by itself is next to useless knowledge is not power the use of knowledge is power those who know what is going on have a much bigger responsibility than those who dont not least because they are denied the excuse of ignorance it is worth everyone asking themselves right i know at least the themes of what is happening but what am i doing about it some will be able to say i am doing a b or c but from what i have observed the vast majority of those in the know wont even get to a some who are doing nothing or next to nothing even think that their contribution should be aiming abuse at those who are doing something we are faced with a massive imbalance between the number who know what we face at least to an extent and those who are doing anything effective about it learning more and more about the nature of our own prison is no good unless we do what is necessary to crumble its walls

2450712 his motivation in doing it was to play the futures market so that after the pipeline blew up and the price of oil increased he could make whatever profit on it
2450713 that shows at least in his mind that it was going to be a significant enough impact to affect the financial markets in a way that he would enrich himself

2450730 im more proud of her than if i was to do it myself

2450732 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2450734 in terms of politics i do believe that doing anything now is not tenable
2450735 that means actively campaigning for barack obama or having a role at the convention hed be a huge distraction

2450742 my observation was that he seemed very sincere it never ceases to amaze me how often this happens
2450743 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let him down

2450750 he tells me he still doesnt remember about the past
2450751 he doesnt remember murdering anybody there and he doesnt remember being a tenant of the couple that was murdered
2450752 in every place there are troublemakers some stay like that and others change

2450795 this commitment has been grounded in the belief that what is good for the environment is good for business and whats good for business can be good for the environment

2450797 they are onboard reducing their carbon footprints making green products they have environmental stewardship programs
2450798 mom and pop ones who think its still too expensive to get up to speed on green technology

2450822 hello my friend we meet again its been a while where should we begin feels like forever
2450823 there is no problem in getting coaches to attend educational workshops the challenge is convincing organizations to offer parent workshops and getting parents to come
2450824 many youth sport organizations are saying yes we are interested in offering these programs but thats it they are not delivering them to parents
2450825 there has been a drive in the last 20 years to teach coaches how to create a healthy psychological environment for young athletes a culture has been created and there is an expectation that coaches will receive training unfortunately too many moms and pops are all too willing to assume they dont have a role in youth sports however they should support what trained coaches are trying to do parents and coaches working together are a powerful combination
2450826 this combined approach helps both parents and coaches to create a mastery oriented climate
2450827 we dont ignore the importance of winning because it is an important objective in all sports but we place winning in its proper perspective as a result young athletes exposed to the mastery climate were able to concentrate more and they had less worries about their performance their bodies also reacted more positively they were less tense had fewer queasy stomachs and they didnt experience feeling tight muscles
2450828 fear of failure is an athletes worst enemy and the sport situation can easily create this type of anxiety
2450829 the encouraging thing is that brief one time workshops for coaches and parents can give them the keys to decreasing pressure and increasing enjoyment and an added bonus is that athletes who are not fearful of failure typically perform better given a few key guidelines coaches and parents can be a winning combination for kids
2450830 you can fool some of the people all the time and those are the ones you want to concentrate on

2450925 to cite one final anecdote the scholarly literature frequently cites marxs great enthusiasm until the more scientifically savvy engels set him straight for a curious book published in 1865 by the now and deservedly unknown french explorer and ethnologist pierre tremaux origine et transformations de lhomme et des autres etres origin and transformation of man and other beings
2450926 i have arrived at the conclusion that there is nothing to his theory if for no other reason than because he neither understands geology nor is capable of the most ordinary literary historical criticism i had long been curious about tremaux and sought a copy of his book for many years i finally purchased one a few years ago and i must say that i have never read a more absurd or more poorly documented thesis basically tremaux argues that the nature of the soil determines national characteristics and that higher civilizations tend to arise on more complex soils formed in later geological periods if marx really believed that such unsupported nonsense could exceed the origin of species in importance then he could not have properly understood or appreciated the power of darwins facts and ideas

2450973 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
2450974 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations

2451273 de hecho m s del 70 de la demanda nominal de gas natural en chile es para la generaci n el ctrica en el norte y en la zona central con la falta de gas las plantas de generaci n de ciclo combinado han tenido que utilizar diesel que es mucho m s caro en comparaci n con el gas natural adem s est el alto coste que todos debemos pagar producto de la mayor contaminaci n que emana del diesel
2451274 el impacto del racionamiento ha implicado que el valor del combustible se cuadriplique debido a que ahora estamos utilizando mayor cantidad de diesel
2451275 es que si no se contaban con los equipos para producir con diesel ahora hay que hacer una nueva inversi n que antes no estaba contemplada lo que ha supuesto un gasto a n mayor para el pa s
2451276 en forma general a todos los chilenos nos ha impactado la escasez de gas natural argentino
2451277 es altamente improbable que volvamos a tener el abastecimiento de gas natural argentino que ten amos en 2003 la producci n argentina se mantendr estable en el mejor de los casos y probablemente comenzar a descender esto porque los yacimientos de gas natural ya est n cerca de su m ximo de producci n y pronto comenzar n a decaer ya est ocurriendo con los yacimientos locales de petr leo y el gas lo seguir muy de cerca
2451278 la reactivaci n econ mica por la que actualmente atraviesa argentina ha producido un aumento en la demanda interna de gas natural por lo que el gobierno trasandino ya no tendr y de hecho ya no tiene excedentes exportables
2451279 vamos a seguir con m nimas cuotas de importaci n de gas natural argentino y vamos a seguir produciendo sobre la base de diesel ya que los sistemas a gas licuado una de las iniciativas que se han estado materializando a nivel de pa s no van a estar listos para el pr ximo a o argentina sigue creciendo lo mismo que su consumo energ tico no veo que nuestro escenario mejore
2451280 de seguir con el actual ritmo de crecimiento en el pa s y si no se toman las medidas pertinentes s lo tendremos energ a asegurada hasta unos cuantos a os m s
2451281 existen varios estudios de exploraci n de energ as alternativas y renovables como la solar e lica y geot rmica que se obtiene del calor interno de y se extrae a partir del agua gases y vapores calientes y se est n evaluando sus posibilidades t cnicas y econ micas como as tambi n la sustentabilidad futura de tales recursos
2451282 al menos el 5 de los nuevos proyectos el ctricos est n basados en energ as renovables
2451283 mientras que en el mbito privado la mayor parte de las proyectos se centran en la energ a e lica e hidr ulica
2451284 a lo largo de nuestro territorio hay muchos sectores con vientos lo cual facilita el montaje de equipos para producir energ a e lica por el hecho de ser un pa s monta oso tambi n es posible implementar sistemas motrices para producir energ a geot rmica asimismo est n las condiciones geogr ficas dadas para montar equipos solares o fotovoltaicos
2451285 nos ayudan a hacernos menos dependientes desde el punto de vista energ tico y todas estas actividades implican tecnolog as nuevas por lo tanto nuevas oportunidades de negocios y empleos adem s al producir sobre la base de energ as renovables nuestras emisiones de todo tipo incluyendo mon xido de carbono disminuyen contribuyendo a la descontaminaci n
2451286 hay estudios que indican que en t rminos medioambientales y despu s de todo el ciclo producir con energ a solar y o e lica contamina m s que producir con sistemas a gas natural ello debido a que hay que fabricar los equipos comercializarlos montarlos y consolidar toda una industria en la cual tambi n interviene el transporte terrestre mar timo y a reo todo esto se traduce en la emanaci n de mayor mon xido de carbono es m s algunos expertos han alzado la voz para advertir que en t rminos medioambientales fabricar equipos solares o fotovoltaicos genera igual o mayor cantidad de desechos en comparaci n con la producci n a base de gas natural
2451287 en el caso de la energ a geot rmica se trata de un recurso que a n no ha sido explorado y el coste de empezar a hacerlo es alt simo la energ a solar tambi n representa un coste 30 veces superior en comparaci n con la producci n de energ a a base de carb n o agua el carb n hoy es un recurso muy atractivo porque es barato pero contamina mucho y a igual que en el caso del diesel se va a ir agotando poco a poco
2451288 reci n ahora existe un esfuerzo significativo y concreto por evaluar proyectos sustentados en energ as renovables pero tales esfuerzos son a n muy escasos y poco focalizados en particular el estudio de la energ a geot rmica est muy atrasado en nuestro pa s y sta puede llegar a convertirse en el pilar del desarrollo de chile en el siglo xxi lamentablemente en el rea de la geotermia los verdaderos expertos en el pa s son menos de cinco y as acontece en los dem s campos de las energ as renovables
2451289 por ejemplo si se llegara a implementar un programa masivo basado en energ a solar t rmica en viviendas ser an un proyecto inviable porque no existe ni la industria ni los instaladores ni el personal adecuado para realizar la debida manutenci n a una realidad tan masiva
2451290 falta una enorme masa de profesionales capacitados en el tema de los recursos renovables
2451291 jap n es un pa s s smico al igual que chile y aqu existe la tecnolog a para implementar sistemas que permiten la producci n a base de energ a nuclear los eventos ca ticos en este mbito aludiendo al desastre de chernobyl son eventos predecibles y evitables y stos no pueden ser un motivo para descartar el uso de la energ a nuclear los proyectos de este tipo deber an abordarse y explorarse a partir de ahora ya que implementar una central nuclear tarda entre 15 y 20 a os entonces hay que tomar una decisi n al respecto dado que la energ a nuclear solucionar a mucho nuestro escenario energ tico
2451292 ya que cuando stas se instalen las tecnolog as para tratar los desechos nucleares van a estar mucho m s desarrolladas creo que en el largo plazo la energ a nuclear va a ser incluso m s barata que los hidrocarburos
2451293 es probadamente mucho m s cara y s lo se ha implementado en pa ses en los cuales se han destinado enormes subsidios del gobierno ya sean directos o indirectos
2451294 la tecnolog a que hoy se utiliza reactores de agua presurizada pwr es poco eficiente incluso menos que cualquier central a carb n adem s est fuertemente sujeta al problema del suministro del combustible y exige grandes unidades generadoras que operen cerca de su m xima potencia todo el tiempo
2451295 es que el combustible nuclear est mucho m s concentrado en unas cuantas fuentes en comparaci n con el petr leo por tanto la gran demanda de energ a en el planeta potenciar una pugna por dominar dichas fuentes nucleares y en pocos a os m s este conflicto de intereses ser mucho m s fuerte probablemente pa ses como estados unidos rusia china e india encabezar n esta pugna y naciones m s peque as como la nuestra quedar n fuera
2451296 yo creo que en 30 a os m s podr amos llegar a contar con energ a nuclear pero s lo es factible si se produce a grandes escalas si el proceso se regula bien no tendr a por qu haber problemas

2451312 my knee felt very good i didnt feel any pings during the race and i am looking forward now to the quarter finals
2451313 i took a more conservative race than usual i would usually have blasted a bit further from the start but the boys pushed me hard throughout i am more than pleased
2451314 every race we are going to step it up a little bit more and a little bit more fingers crossed toes crossed everything crossed that we can have a nice clean run through to the semi finals now

2451316 the correction center administration and the entire inmate population there had a joint discussion on the escape incident and that it had been stated by the inmates in no uncertain terms that they were really infuriated by the escape they had added that it was not only from the guards that the inmates had escaped in actual he had also escaped from them and therefore they too were to blame
2451317 it is also from us that the inmate has escaped

2451333 i ignored the phone calls everybody knew i grew up listening to mariah and now somebody is calling me saying mariahs producer wants to work with you i thought it was bull

2451338 shyo two hundred thirty two years of democracy i had no idea you mean that in america every person has been able to vote since 1776
2451339 ummmm no actually we were at war with england in 1776 and the first president under our constitution wasnt elected until 1789 and only white men who owned a certain amount of property could vote
2451340 i dont really know but women could vote in 1920
2451341 it took a hundred and fifty years for women to vote what about blacks
2451342 well some blacks voted after the civil war in the 1860s but a lot of places kept blacks and poor people from voting until 1965

2451352 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2451353 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2451354 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2451355 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2451356 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2451357 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2451358 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2451359 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2451373 als die strahlende olympische flamme die nacht ber dem vogelnest erleuchtete sah die welt nicht nur ein modernes china mit 5000 j hriger geschichte sondern ein selbstbewusstes starkes und weises china diese au ergew hnliche nacht in peking wird zu einem wichtigen kapitel in der geschichte der zivilisierten welt werden
2451374 der stolz pekings ist dass wir unsere verpflichtungen gegen ber der internationalen gemeinschaft erfolgreiche spiele zu erm glichen erf llt haben wir sind aber auch stolz auf peking das die erwartungen von 1 3 milliarden chinesen nicht entt uscht hat
2451375 der jahrhunderttraum von olympia ist auch der traum von einem starken china beides ist realit t geworden
2451376 die er ffnungsfeier gab der kommunistischen partei die gr tm gliche ununterbrochene und ungefilterte chance ein gewaltiges weltweites publikum zu erreichen eine olympische er ffnungsfeier ist eine propaganda bung die blockbuster show am freitagabend demonstrierte die gro e pr herausforderung die vor der kommunistischen partei liegt wenn china immer reicher und st rker wird die partei m chte den nationalstolz f rdern seine eigene legitimation abpolstern und zugleich der welt zeigen dass von chinas aufstieg keine gefahr ausgeht
2451377 keine demokratie k nnte oder sollte das geld und die manpower investieren die in diese feuerwerk speiende verg tterung des nationalstolzes sowie die selbstbeweihr ucherung der kommunistischen partei geflossen sind
2451378 angesichts der starken pr senz der armee offiziere w hrend der gesammten prozedur kann man sich schon fragen was genau die gastgeber der internationalen gemeinschaft vermitteln wollten
2451379 gelandet auf dem planeten olympia die er ffnungsfeier im fabelhaften vogelnest hat ihre versprechungen gehalten ein audivisuelles spektakel und eine grandiose lichtshow gekr nt von der spektakul ren entz ndung des feuers die sommerspiele haben gut begonnen in einem land in dem manche freiheiten nicht existieren
2451380 der chinesische regisseur zhang yimou dirigiert eine zeremonie von einmaliger gr e die milliarden zuschauer auf der ganzen welt im griff gehalten hat
2451381 f r die fabelhafteste show in der geschichte der spiele hat china an nichts gespart die vier stunden lange er ffnungszeremonie hat das beste an chinesischer kultur technologie und einfallsreichtum geboten
2451382 die zeremonie die die olympischen spiele er ffnet hat bertraf alle vorherigen in zahlen farben lautst rke und kosten und demonstrierte der welt dass das neue china seine pr senz zeigen will
2451383 china marschiert auf die weltb hne es hat den f hrern der welt im stadion und milliarden vor den bildschirmen seine muskeln gezeigt ein olympisches ideal die trennung von sport und politik starb in dieser chinesischen nacht das war eine choreographierte demonstration der macht
2451384 hollywood wird die er ffnungsfeier jahrelang studieren um hinter die chinesischen tricks zu kommen das zeitalter chinesischer macht ist mit einem faszinierenden futuristischen auftakt angebrochen zu sagen diese spiele seien ein meilenstein der weltpolitik war kein leeres gerede
2451385 china beginnt endlich zu zeigen wovon das land in den letzten sieben jahren getr umt hat
2451386 die er ffnungsfeier zeigt die stolze perfektion eines landes das schneller als der rest der welt w chst und es auch zeigen will
2451387 mit dieser er ffnung zerschneidet der regisseur und k nstlerische direktor der veranstaltung zhang yimou die nabelschnur die das land mit den letzten 100 jahren seiner geschichte verband
2451388 die gr te veranstaltung der olympischen geschichte china pr sentiert der welt eine spektakul re er ffnungszeremonie einen triumph von lichtern kl ngen und farben eine choreographie wie man sie noch nie gesehen hat
2451389 china bietet eine beispiellose mischung aus kunst fantasie und technologie von fast be ngstigender perfektion
2451390 einen derartig berw ltigenden einsatz des menschen in der masse hatte man seit leni riefenstahl 1936 in berlin nicht mehr gesehen und jene choreografie d rfte in peking um den faktor 100 bertroffen worden sein
2451391 pomp se perfektion die symbolik der er ffnung war weitgehend und wenig berraschend auf einer faszinierenden beherrschung der massen auf dominanz st rke die betonung der geschichte des landes und auf lebensfreude in ihren grellsten farben aufgebaut
2451392 were looking at some options at the moment hopefully well have someone in for the start of the season
2451393 cristiano will now settle down and enjoy his career here
2451394 he has four years left on his contract and at some point wed like to extend it thats where we are
2451395 i cant deny it was an important issue to keep him here there are very few players who have left me against my will
2451396 as cristiano gets older he will appreciate being here more that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont want to leave
2451397 if you look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds but he has become a real manchester united person who now loves the club i think cristiano realises that
2451398 alex ferguson hes outstanding and i have the utmost respect for him
2451399 but theres just something about him and them that i love beating if im honest i think i love beating them more than beating even arsenal its something there just like alex always wants to beat liverpool

2451407 i knew i was wrongfully accused i just had to wait it out
2451408 when we put it all together it became clear to me at that point there was reasonable doubt and in fact it was likely they didnt commit the crime
2451409 if someone is in custody improperly we have to release them as soon as possible
2451410 this is a case that weighed so heavily on my heart
2451411 every once in a while you have a case that just doesnt add up
2451412 they were in the wrong place at the wrong time
2451413 its nice every once in a while to see everyone is on the same page as to justice being done
2451414 if i look back over the last four years we did everything we could to prepare ourselves the best way we could for here
2451415 now its time to just get in the water and race
2451416 that was really one of the first times i was getting acclimatized to swimming that program
2451417 every race i pretty much went for it every semifinal i went for it i wasnt controlling myself and trying to save physical and emotional energy this time around ive been able to manage my energy manage my time better save what i need for the final
2451418 its going to be one of the best events at the olympics to watch in any sport
2451419 obviously theyre great swimmers but theyre plain great racers when they get back there you know something special is going to happen
2451420 honestly i really dont feel like swimmers feel like that
2451421 i bet there are some but hes so dominant in everything he swims most swimmers are trying to get second because they dont feel like they can beat him
2451422 thats definitely not the case with me i always feel like i can beat him
2451423 its pretty standard we have something happen all the time
2451424 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2451425 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
2451426 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
2451427 i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
2451428 he gets to keep his love of learning alive the world is his classroom
2451429 this court was under pressure they did it to protect themselves and their reputation those judges want to be supreme court judges they want to move up theyre not going to do anything to upset their careers
2451430 educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd circuit
2451431 it preexisted this state it preexisted us parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning
2451432 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
2451433 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction
2451434 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful
2451435 i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare
2451436 i dont think hes going to be making a living in politics any time soon
2451437 the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown
2451438 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2451439 she is the finest human being i have ever known
2451440 i was trying to keep this mistake i had made from becoming public
2451441 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2451442 i dont know if the picture has been altered manufactured if its a picture of me taken some other time holding another baby i have no idea
2451443 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing nothing could be further from the truth
2451444 one of the things that people thought about shawn is that hes going to always be a rough guy and hold and punch and elbow
2451445 but shawn can box hes a very good boxer and thats what were going to prove here
2451446 i kind of already knew what he had what he was going to bring
2451447 but i kept my composure and finished the rounds ahead on points and i did what i had to do which was keep the lead and get the victory
2451448 everybody thought this would be a rough match we were waiting to see which shawn was going to show up
2451449 we have worked very very very hard with him on going back to boxing hes a good boxer has been for years
2451450 we just wanted him to show what he can do boxing he doesnt have to be rough
2451451 he pushes me every phone call every time i talk to him
2451452 i talked to him friday he told me in spanish
2451453 chinese culture is so amazing the olympics are so hard earned
2451454 i dont know if i can live long enough to see the next olympics so i had to be here to participate to show i care
2451455 look at the spirit of these people isnt it exciting
2451456 probably been preparing for this day since deng xiaoping opened up china to the world
2451457 ive been told to stay away from the birds nest because we are not locals and we have no tickets
2451458 i am a peasant by birth these games are not for people like me good thing there are tvs
2451459 its good to see public acknowledgment that our story was accurate all along
2451460 probably the biggest question about this whole mess is why the mainstream media protected edwards by ignoring the story for the past 8 months
2451461 i think its entirely appropriate for a news organization to wait to report a story until they have information that theyre comfortable with reporting
2451462 all i can say is that were not in the business of printing things we dont know to be true
2451463 the problem with a story like this is that its very very difficult to ascertain the truth until one of the people steps forward
2451464 the national enquirer is a supermarket tabloid that is accurate some of the time and inaccurate some of the time
2451465 it was the subject of late night talk shows and certainly all over the web
2451466 it was in our culture and in our faces and to act as if it didnt exist would be to ignore reality
2451467 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
2451468 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
2451469 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
2451470 as far as i can determine the international union has not received allegations concerning freemans local if the international union receives allegations about a local that warrant further action we have internal union procedures for handling them

2451478 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt

2451483 i grew up as a small town boy in north carolina came from nothing worked very hard dreamed that i could do something helpful for other people with my life became a lawyer through a lot of work and success i got some acclaim as a lawyer
2451484 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
2451485 i was at the beverly hilton i was trying to keep this mistake i made from becoming public

2451501 were not in a position to make public what information we have
2451502 we have located a number of sizable caches of insurgent weapons ied making supplies narcotics and money
2451503 the loss of these supplies is anticipated to significantly reduce insurgent capabilities in both kandahar and helmand provinces
2451504 we know that this area of maywand district is a theatre for other areas inside kandahar and inside helmand and we knew that if we could get in there for a prolonged period we could actually cause disruption that would ripple through and assist in other s
2451505 we know that we hemmed them in pretty well so anybody that couldnt escape the area has had to abandon their weapons to hide their weapons to try to blend in with the locals
2451506 they are actually starting to say you should maybe go and check out this particular area because there is some insurgents who are holed up and waiting for you to leave

2451523 a female voice one day announced itself from another department of the bbc to ask can you write hymns 1 expect so but 1 have never tried she then went on to explain not particularly flatteringly that she had approached some of the best poets but that their efforts had not pleased the editors she said she wanted three hymns how soon might she have them on being told probably the next day she undoubtedly took umbrage so much umbrage indeed that j a dived into the exercise at home that night found it harder than he had thought and worked into the small hours nevertheless the hymns were written and duly delivered next day they were to be on the subjects of harvest festival rogation and plough sunday oddly enough one of them the harvest hymn caught on it was simple enough in all conscience the chairman of the editorial board who was a bishop objected to the almighty being referred to as you the amused author pointed out that he did not wish to sound deliberately archaic so the matter was resolved when the bishop agreed to such use provided the initial letter was a capital although j a sang the lines to himself in his utterly tuneless voice as he wrote he did not dare to make any suggestion as to music it was the editorial board who decided on the use of the english traditional melody shipston though congregations all over the place seem to use any sort of music that occurs to them he never hawked it not once but demands for it came in from almost every christian denomination and from all over the world it made him several hundred times more per word than anything else he ever wrote the americans in particular were generous in their payment of the three hymns that was the one that gave the least trouble first written it prompted the idea that hymn writing was simple the next two stretching far into the night convinced him that it was not despite its apparent popularity nobody ever asked him to write another hymn which was fortunate because he probably could not have done so the young mans confidence soon faded into humility it is though it must be admitted deeply stirring to hear ones own words sung not necessarily by a master choir but by ordinary people who unlike the writer can sing in tune less comfortable is the feeling when one of those students who call themselves hymnologists writes with earnest questions about his spiritual experience or something even more elaborate it remains nevertheless seriously and quite apart from its continuing contribution to income a rewarding experience humbly accepted

2451557 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
2451558 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
2451559 smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 percent year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0 percent
2451560 however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices

2451691 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with sen obama than sen mccain
2451692 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now

2451714 china is ostensibly communist but it has more billionaires than any country except the united states
2451715 in fact chinese workers like workers everywhere are facing hard times the economy has become export oriented and dominated by foreign multinational corporations chinese manufacturing employment has actually declined in absolute numbers decent jobs are scare social services are disappearing and competitive pressures demand ever greater sacrifices at the same time a small but significant percentage of the population is growing fabulously wealthy china isnt the problem our global economic system is
2451716 i have the highest regard for groups like amnesty international and human rights watch and believe they should continue to do all they can to further improve the human rights record in china
2451717 while the cultural revolution was successful in many respects it stopped the famines provided enough clothing the leadership over the last two decades pursued a plan of growth that virtually no one thought they could achieve quadrupling the economy
2451718 many hawks would make china out to be a grave military threat to the u s but consider for example some very simple facts the u s has 12 aircraft carriers china has none the united states has over 700 military bases and other installations outside its borders while china has none 250 000 u s military are stationed overseas not counting the mercenaries but again china has none china has 100 400 nuclear weapons the u s has 10 000 the chinese have much better grounds for fearing the united states than the other way around

2451721 many workers approaching traditional retirement ages say they want to keep working but its not yet clear how many will be able to keep their jobs or find new ones
2451722 employers seem to value older workers for their maturity experience and work ethic but worry about out of date skills and the high cost of employing them

2451730 marv and judy mccown have been the reason the kansas governors one shot turkey hunt has lasted 22 years and through the tenure of four governors
2451731 their retirement will leave huge shoes to fill in the governors hunt we are glad they have agreed to stay involved for one more hunt to be held next april and we wish them good health and a great retirement
2451732 marv and judy have done an amazing job over the past 22 years making the governors hunt a remarkable event for all those involved
2451733 as just one of the governors who has benefited from the mccowns dedication and expertise over the years i offer my warm thanks and best wishes to them both well miss them greatly
2451734 kasatochi went from a quiet volcano to an explosive eruption within 24 hours and with very little warning
2451735 we are thankful our colleagues were able to get out before the eruption began they were rescued just in time by a local fishing boat
2451736 fortunately the existing seismic networks on nearby volcanoes picked up the activity at kasatochi volcano
2451737 they were installed with funding from the federal aviation administration to reduce the hazard to aviation from volcanic ash these networks were crucial in recognizing that this volcano had entered the first stage of a major eruption
2451738 our hope is to have monitoring equipment on all volcanoes that pose the greatest threats to public safety
2451739 satellite imagery is useful to see the big picture of what is happening and what is going into the atmosphere but direct instrumentation such as placing seismic monitors around a volcano will help give an early warning and give people more time to plan for hazardous events

2451763 rep cohens violent and bizarre actions against musurlian are taken in the most charitable light possible conduct ill befitting a member of congress
2451764 we know of at least two ongoing criminal investigations and i suspect the house of representatives will be instituting disciplinary proceedings against rep cohen for both his criminal assault and defamatory remarks toward the armenian american community once congress returns equally disturbing is rep cohens characterization of both musurlian a veteran of the u s armed forces and armenian americans as killers and assassins this incident raises serious question as to whether this man is fit to remain a member of congress
2451765 there have been armenians who assassinated and killed many people including people in this country

2451777 a settlement will be reached but what remains to be seen is whether the agreement can be implemented a formula has to be found to mix oil and water
2451778 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2451779 i was alone i opened my eyes and you were there
2451780 definitely he is going to stay with us coach bernd schuster has said he wants him in our team
2451781 we dont see any possibility of robinho leaving real madrid although we know that chelsea are interested in signing him
2451782 i dont mind that other clubs try to sign our players its normal we have very good players anyone would like to have one of them for sale
2451783 but robinho wants to be with us he is one of the best players we have in our team and we need him for next season
2451784 robinho is very angry with the way that the directors of real madrid have behaved towards him
2451785 he calls me every day to see if anyone has told me anything about his future and i have to tell him that i have received no calls
2451786 do you know how long i have wanted this ever since i first saw you come in that place i knew that i wanted to fuck you

2451809 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth and asked for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness we have kept this within our family since that time
2451810 i grew up as a small town boy in north carolina came from nothing worked very hard dreamed that i could do something helpful for other people with my life became a lawyer through a lot of work and success i got some acclaim as a lawyer
2451811 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
2451812 i was at the beverly hilton i was trying to keep this mistake i made from becoming public
2451813 ive never paid a dime of money never asked anybody to pay a dime of money nothing has been done at my request

2451816 no society can properly function without classification without an arrangement of things and men in classes and prescribed types this necessary classification is the basis for all social discrimination and discrimination present opinion to the contrary notwithstanding is no less a constituent element of the social realm than equality is a constituent of the political the point is that in society everybody must answer the question of what he is as distinct from the question of who he is which his role is and his function and the answer of course can never be i am unique not because of the implicit arrogance but because the answer would be meaningless

2451831 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2451832 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
2451833 it was hilarious the lads wanted cristiano to know there was no tension after all the transfer talk
2451834 they sorted the shirt out earlier this week and couldnt wait to give it to him when he reported back for duty cristiano took it in very good spirit the lads love playing pranks on each other dont forget rio ferdinand even did his own tv show of wind ups and this was up there with the best
2451835 it was the perfect way to put an end to all the speculation about whether ronnie was going or staying hes a big hit in the dressing room and the lads are delighted to have him back
2451836 we bocog promised free access except for a few websites that jeopardise our security and the healthy growth of our youth
2451837 thats an assessment made by the authorities of which sites are good and which are not good for our youth its like what any other country does
2451838 hopefully at some point we would like to extend it thats where we are
2451839 its not easy for young people to come to our country it doesnt matter where they go they have to settle in get used to the culture get used to the dressing room and then you can see their development and feel for the place
2451840 things dont happen overnight its done by time and we hope that all the players we have settle here to have great careers at the club
2451841 oh im so glad that im not one of those

2451847 he was reportedly attacked by three men all armed with handguns who discharged rounds at him
2451848 no where in the request for an extension of parliament does it state that there is a national crisis that requires the recess be put back
2451849 what is the rationale for pushing through with this legislation in a matter of five days
2451850 if the government feels it alone can make the decisions i would hope it doesnt do so
2451851 as you would appreciate these bills require in depth analysis widespread consultation and profound consideration before we could reasonably respond to their thrust import and intent
2451852 we consider it unreasonable to be expected to effectively scrutinize and arrive at informed positions on these bills in such a short time and with already depleted numbers
2451853 unless there are special reasons for so doing no sitting of the national assembly shall be held from 10th august to 10th october in any year

2451858 it has been observed that mobile cellular phones are frequently used to facilitate planning and commission of serious crimes also there has been a spate of thefts of mobile devices by unscrupulous persons in order to track these sources in the investigation by the police the identification of the persons in possession of the cellular devices is very vital

2451864 education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught
2451865 most people are other people their thoughts are someone elses opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotations
2451866 nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
2451867 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions
2451868 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2451869 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2451870 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions
2451871 calls on all parties to cease hostilities and to resume without delay so as to secure a political solution to the crisis which respects georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

2451884 we have three options now first it may be played on sunday as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two a decision will be taken by the committee at 1600 hrs
2451885 the ground at gachibowli was unplayable and with the kind of rain here it will be worse on sunday the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2451886 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground
2451887 i dont know which place we would like to play with rain everywhere in the country but dont tell me kolkata

2451946 that cumulative x ray exposure from ct scans and other sources can be very harmful so we always want to do what we can to minimize x ray exposure for patients

2451949 in moderately active individuals short durations of stretching seem to temporarily improve flexibility without the detrimental strength losses that have been previously reported
2451950 pre competition stretching became controversial due to what has been reported as decreases in performance however future research still needs to determine how these stretching exercises may impact athletes
2451951 durations of stretching at or less than eight minutes may not significantly alter lower leg strength
2451952 our findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that for these muscles there may be a threshold of stretching between eight and 10 minutes that would be necessary to decrease muscle strength

2451962 it was ideal preparation because it was a pacy game
2451963 we wanted an intense game and i think ajax gave us more than we wanted they fought for every ball and played well
2451964 in the whole game we were always dangerous going forward but they took advantage of two lapses of concentration and scored two fantastic goals

2451990 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
2451991 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
2451992 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
2451993 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
2451994 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
2451995 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
2451996 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
2451997 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

2452002 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2452003 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2452004 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2452005 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2452006 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2452007 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2452008 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2452009 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2452122 nu al betaalt iedereen zon 4000 euro per jaar aan premie
2452123 mensen blijven daartoe bereid mits dat geld goed wordt besteed dus w l voor de bouw van eenpersoonskamers in tehuizen niet voor bureautjes die je tegen vergoeding vertellen hoe je je eigen oma mee kunt nemen naar de film voor 45 euro per uur

2452139 since gerard was having a difficult time i made his hole bigger to help him lie down for a little bit gerard was very cold i was also cold and began to shiver on purpose to create heat i was wasting energy but i needed to get warm
2452140 i made sure not to fall asleep because i could have fallen over
2452141 all of a sudden i saw an avalanche coming down it was only 20 metres to my right i saw the body of gerard sweep past me
2452142 when you are up in the mountains its easy to become friends but it was particular with gerard
2452143 the beard everything he looked like christ he was always smiling he was a flower
2452144 we had made our plans even the weather was good
2452145 we didnt have the right ropes for that part of the climb but i started shouting i told them that the first person to reach the summit of k2 did it at 6pm so lets move
2452146 when we were walking down another avalanche struck it hit two sherpas who were helping us and an oxygen bottle came cascading down and hit me in the back of the head
2452147 the avalanche would have taken me away with it but i was lucky one of the sherpas his name was pemba grabbed me from behind he was holding my neck he saved my life
2452148 but i was not going to give up i was going to make my way down even if it meant having to walk all the way to islamabad

2452158 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of ossetian capital tskhinvali

2452166 now the difference is that its the civilian population thats taking the brunt of the aggression
2452167 i saw bodies on the streets in cars its impossible to count them there is hardly a single building undamaged
2452168 we are fixing that now i am very hopeful and confident this will be settled soonest

2452227 setelah membaca perlembagaan persekutuan beberapa kali tentang pilihanraya dan suruhanjaya pilihanraya serta undang undang berkaitan pilihanraya saya berpendapat spr tidak perlu memanggil pilihanraya kecil permatang pauh berikutan peletakan jawatan wan azizah
2452228 wan azizah letak jawatan mp dato pirdaus boleh diisytiharkan sebagai mp permatang pauh
2452229 memang kerajaan menggalakkan kita membincangkan perkara yang mempunyai kesan kepada rakyat tetapi kalau ia boleh menimbulkan salah faham dan menyentuh perasaan kaum atau penganut agama lain saya fikir ia perlu dielakkan
2452230 soal berkenaan agama adalah perkara yang cukup sensitif di negara ini jangan fikir dalam melaksanakan hak kita orang lain tidak mempunyai hak
2452231 justeru majlis peguam perlu menggunakan pendekatan bijaksana dan kewarasan kerana ia menjadi penentu kepada ketenteraman di negara ini

2452236 artikel itu menghina penggunaan pembesar suara oleh sesuatu komuniti untuk menjalankan ibadat dan dalam konteks artikel itu yang merujuk kepada pembinaan masjid ia ditujukan terhadap laungan azan
2452237 artikel itu menyatakan secara tidak langsung bahawa panggilan azan adalah pencemaran suara atau bunyi ia juga mempersoalkan pembinaan masjid di kawasan yang kononnya komuniti bukan islam rujukan komuniti bukan islam tidak wujud di malaysia negara berbilang kaum
2452238 umno shah alam mahu polis dan kementerian keselamatan dalam negeri menyiasat penulis terbabit dan artikel berkenaan
2452239 rakyat malaysia perlu mengamalkan toleransi yang lebih memandangkan masyarakat negara ini berbilang kaum dan menganut pelbagai agama kita harap orang ini sedar bahawa kita telah hidup sekian lama dalam keadaan aman dan baik kerana sikap toleransi yang baik
2452240 kita harap perbuatan tidak berfaedah ini tidak berulang hingga boleh sebabkan ketegangan
2452241 majlis peguam percaya kepada kebebasan bersuara dan beragama yang diamalkan di negara ini apa yang disiarkan dalam infoline itu adalah pendapat individu sama ada dari kalangan peguam atau orang awam sendiri
2452242 artikel itu hanyalah pendapat dan biarlah pembaca menghakimi kandungan artikel berkenaan jika mereka merasakan ia salah kita bersedia menyiarkan artikel balas daripada pihak mereka
2452243 kami alu alukan jika ada artikel yang ingin membalas semula isu yang dibangkitkan oleh penulis artikel berkenaan yang dikatakan menghina islam itu
2452244 penulis seelok eloknya memohon maaf kepada orang islam di negara ini kerana dia tidak sensitif dan secara terang menulis mengenai masjid walaupun kita tahu agama lain juga mempunyai cara mereka sendiri yang boleh dikatakan sama bisingnya

2452247 in malaysia religion is sensitive its not like in indonesia where they can marry freely like suharto hes muslim but his wife is christian in malaysia we have our federal constitution what they are doing is trying to destroy it
2452248 for me as a muslim i object to non muslims raising such a sensitive issue dont touch on the issue of religion thats a personal matter
2452249 its unfortunate that the forum coud not go on theres no conclusion for me its hanging
2452250 when you do a forum behind closed doors like this the people outside dont know who are on the panel they should have it outside like dataran merdeka
2452251 when you talk about people coming into islam there will be issues the people downstairs they dont know that
2452252 they make assumptions for those of us who are mature and educated we can think for ourselves but not everyone who came today are educated so they become very emotional because of this sensitive issue
2452253 so today there were political elements there were some people who did not give correct information
2452254 we can give our views on religion but the focus should not only be on islam
2452255 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2452256 it is something sad but happens in all divorce matters what i saw its not an issue of religion but how the people handled the matter the law is there the execution of the law is how its done per se its not an issue of conversion
2452257 but there is a twist in other court cases the pain and suffering is heard on both sides in this case because of the legal system where there are two jurisdictions the non converting spouse is confused and terrified thats why the heartbreak is exponentially increased in this situation
2452258 there is a problem and were trying to reconcile the differences trying to see whats the best way to move forward the problem will not go away unless we deal with it its a very human issue and as malaysians it is our responsibility to find ways to deal with it
2452259 apart from the legal issues we must focus on the humanitarian issues i think it is important to realise that saravanan subashini and shamala are not just names but real people
2452260 dengan bukti terbaru ini telah memberi kelegaan yang besar pada kita
2452261 tak patut sangatlah tuduh orang macam itu apakah dia nak soalan soalan yang boleh dia balun kerajaan je kalau begitu jangan memekak sana sini kononnya dia begitu prihatin tentang kebebasan akhbar
2452262 juga kita ingin membawa pada satu insiden lain iaitu sidang akhbar datin seri dr wan azizah ismail di lobi bangunan parlimen selepas beliau dan nurul izzah menemui perdana menteri sejurus isu dakwaan liwat anwar berbangkit ini berhubung dengan dakwaan adanya ancaman bunuh keatasnya
2452263 saudara jangan terperangkap memang ada pencacai pencacai mereka dalam media tidak ramai satu dua bahkan hari ini cukup biadap pada azizah saya nak beritahu pada mereka kalau kamu benar dan berani kamu berhadapan dengan saya jangan ganggu isteri dan anak saya
2452264 biadap itu istilah apa pak sheikh sedangkan soalan wartawan agendadaily semasa di ruang lobi parlimen cuma nak tanya apakah bukti ancaman bunuh itu

2452266 oleh sebab pemimpin pemimpin melayu bersetuju untuk melonggarkan syarat syarat kewarganegaraan pemimpin pemimpin komuniti cina dan india telah menerima kedudukan istimewa melayu sebagai penduduk asli malaya dengan penubuhan malaysia status kedudukan istimewa itu diperluas untuk merangkumi komuniti komuniti penduduk asli sabah dan sarawak
2452267 apabila kami orang orang melayu menentang malayan union yang menjejaskan kedudukan hak hak orang melayu kaum kaum lain tidak mengambil bahagian kerana mereka mengatakan ini hanya merupakan masalah melayu dan bukan masalah mereka mereka juga menunjukkan bahawa kesetiaan mereka adalah kepada negara negara asal mereka dan oleh itu menentang laporan barnes yang bertujuan untuk menjadikan bahasa melayu menjadi bahasa kebangsaan jika kami menyerahkan orang orang melayu kepada orang orang yang dikatakan orang malaya ketika kerakyatan mereka masih belum ditakrifkan kami akan menghadapi banyak masalah pada masa hadapan
2452268 bagi mereka yang mencintai dan berasa bahawa mereka terhutang kesetiaan yang tidak berbelah bagi kami menyambut mereka sebagai orang malaya mereka harus merupakan orang malaya yang benar dan mereka akan mempunyai hak hak dan hak hak istimewa yang sama dengan orang orang melayu

2452271 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2452272 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2452273 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2452276 one of the very strong pieces of john edwards was his relationship with his wife
2452277 he was seen as the kind of husband that a lot of men would like to be in those situations and that a lot of wives would like to have he became a model husband in that circumstance
2452278 this is the kind of thing that is really gut wrenching
2452279 what if he had won the nomination what kind of mess would that have put this party in
2452280 he didnt have the cab driver take him home or to his girlfriends house or some other place he went to dix if he had been there before why else would he go there

2452288 ive met him six or seven times he beat me the first time we met and this is the second defeat
2452289 i was just trying to get myself into the game against him it was very hard to do anything because every time i pushed forward he fought back
2452290 he had a good day and i didnt really feel up to it i havent felt weak or anything im feeling quite normal im not sure what it is

2452321 ive been riding for 30 years and rarely even got seven day suspensions
2452322 the 21 days seems like a lot but considering she broke her leg i understand
2452323 my horse switched leads and came in a little bit i didnt even know there had been a spill until i was coming back after the race and saw the loose horses running around
2452324 shes a good rider and it was just an unlucky situation i went to the hospital to see her and she understood weve been riding together for three years and it certainly wasnt deliberate were all trying hard to win but ive never dropped a rider before i feel terrible for her it still bothers me

2452326 i wouldnt pass the buck to the players i think im under the gun we got to stay on top of things
2452327 maybe i overreacted in the sense that i think they exploited a couple of things
2452328 i think they really didnt try to get both sides

2452336 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2452337 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2452338 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2452339 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence
2452340 it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
2452341 i dont feel sorry about things that didnt happen its reality thats the way it goes
2452342 competing in the olympic games has always been one of my dreams and i wish i would have been able to represent my country alongside my teammates
2452343 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2452344 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2452345 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2452346 i was in a bad area for a signal and my phone said call lost
2452347 i hurt my groin about a month and a half ago and just havent pitched much since then when i got activated off the disabled list everyone else was throwing good and there was pretty much no room but i feel good well see how it goes from here
2452348 hes got experience hes very useable and hes been there
2452349 i think hes going to get to pitch quite a bit and hes going to help us when i listened to him talk he feels like hes ready hes healthy and hes ready to go
2452350 im very happy im with a team in first place and i couldnt be more happy with the situation
2452351 well have a better idea of where hes headed with this after that
2452352 lew knows more about his anatomy so i think that its important we get another opinion on how were going to proceed
2452353 right now flash is just trying to gather his information and try to figure out whats best for him we have not talked about surgery no ones even mentioned if hes having surgery i think for him right now its probably just a little overwhelming to get it all in and see where hes heading
2452354 obviously im disappointed you never want to go down but ill get some innings in and get back on track and stay on their radar
2452355 happs going to play in the big leagues and more likely hes going to pitch with the phillies
2452356 it was slow to hit me but that moment is finally here with all the phone calls from friends that makes me realize this is something more special its mind boggling to me
2452357 i think it was the most complicated contract ive ever seen
2452358 its definitely the longest contract ive ever seen it was 52 pages of just addendums
2452359 it gives you that peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2452360 all of us wanted to get the deal done as quick as we could
2452361 but brian and his agent they hung in there there wasnt a single moment when there was any threat they couldnt have been more positive or professional throughout the whole thing even this afternoon they werent saying lets hurry up or hes not going to play in this game
2452362 i cant speak to why the deal didnt get done before but i know we kept hammering away in order to do something that made sense for the player
2452363 from the first day i was able to represent brian we worked aggressively with the team to try to make something work we tried to get very creative and find a structure that would allow us to get something done while still dealing with the rules that were in place
2452364 it can be great if we continue to stay healthy and continue to progress
2452365 consistency is the main thing we have to focus on having all our guys healthy and being full steam ahead we can do some great things seeing what we were able to do at the end of last year we have to put it together
2452366 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time
2452367 they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2452368 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2452369 its the biggest game in the worlds history thats what theyre saying
2452370 do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars
2452371 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2452372 i was there along with coach cheeks and tony dileo when the injury occurred which was during a routine five on five drill at an nba approved camp held in las vegas
2452373 there was no contact made with jason when he suffered the injury
2452374 at this point we will continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
2452375 but hes a hard worker hes going to get this taken care of and be back to 100 percent
2452376 darylls done very very well and part of that is because hes played in games more than pat has
2452377 and so when he comes into preseason and does really well daryll hasnt left the door open for anyone to jump him but pat really hasnt done anything to fall behind or not be right there with him
2452378 i think ive made it clear that i would prefer to play one quarterback
2452379 but the way the game is played today with the quarterback really physically so much more involved in it i think you got to be careful
2452380 you needed a guy in there who just took over the whole football team
2452381 in my mind im like ok keep doing what youre doing and you will wind up being the starter
2452382 unless were going to do the dual quarterback thing if thats the case thats fine too
2452383 were going to try and put the right guy in the right place at the right time and doing the right thing
2452384 devlin may be the guy i have no way of knowing yet weve had four days of practice
2452385 i dont think there is one team in the country that can beat us every single time
2452386 if we hit well from 1 to 9 theres no one can beat us
2452387 unless there is a collapse in oil demand within the next five to ten years there will be serious oil supply crunch not because of below ground resource constraints but because of inadequate investment by national amp international oil companies
2452388 the bradford community guide a guide to community and development projects
2452389 five different scenarios for the future of iraq and then examines competing images of iran saudi arabia and the united states the issues of national identity sectarianism and federalism and concludes by exploring a number of possible future paths and processes
2452390 in order to overcome the disagreements negotiation must prevail through comprehension of russias perspective as opposed to the confrontational rhetoric and calls for punitive measures endorsed by senator john mccain
2452391 that strengthening relationships is the key to building a better happier and fairer society and should be the cornerstone of any effective anti poverty strategy
2452392 recapturing the dominant narrative in us politics is the key task facing contemporary american liberals that dominant narrative has to recapture the potential of the new deal from its conservative detractors it lies not in the nonsense of trickle down economics but in policies designed to enhance the strength skills and security of a vibrant middle class a middle class expanded at the bottom by policy to raise the poor and at the top by policy to curb the rich
2452393 it was all nba just them talking about strengths and minuses of all these players what they would do if they were the general manager how theyd get rid of this guy before his value went down
2452394 i could hear them being three gms back there what they would do for every team it was funny theyre very knowledgeable
2452395 i was excited about the season even before the new contract
2452396 this has given that extra measure of knowing that im going to be taken care of here im excited about this team
2452397 were talking about a hall of fame caliber player this is a premier guy leader and player
2452398 i mean what hes done the last few weeks with this going on the work he came out there when he had strep throat and practiced when he had an excuse regardless of what was going on
2452399 he just wants to win so badly he wants the team to be the best it can be thats what drives him thats whats always driven him thats the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2452400 i guess my gripe with outside the lines would be that they didnt really try to get both sides
2452401 he said some football players told him they were prevented from talking to the people at judicial affairs i said who are those players he gave no names
2452402 i get sick and tired of people saying anonymous no names a source i mean he said i sent those unidentified players a text message i dont even know how to send a text message ive never had a text message come to me
2452403 that kind of stuff bothered me a little bit but i cant walk away from the fact we had some kids who did something wrong
2452404 the reasons i dismissed taylor and baker are reasons that the squad knows
2452405 theyre all proud to have been penn state football players
2452406 i really dont have an opinion about some of the things that happened they happened were human we make mistakes we learn from them and go on with our lives
2452407 i didnt actually see it when it played because i was driving back to school
2452408 but i took a peek at it on the internet i turned it off within like 2 minutes its no good for anybody to watch stuff like that
2452409 it wasnt just the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season just before the michigan game i was very close to her as much as i hate to admit it i wasnt as mentally focused on the football field
2452410 i learned a lot but now its over i dont think about it at all anymore i took a step back but im trying to get back to where i was
2452411 when a team is on a bad roll as were the as you want to keep them down
2452412 he had played great in the las vegas summer league he had so much more confidence this was a freak thing there was no contact with anyone else
2452413 jason was going to the basket making a normal move and this was a freak thing
2452414 this is devastating for him because hes had such a great summer and his confidence has been sky high this is a bump in the road but hell come back because of his incredible work ethic
2452415 its unfortunate that this happened but jason is resilient and hell receive the best treatment available
2452416 a routine five on five drill at an nba approved camp
2452417 they would go to sleep and they wouldnt stand up again you would think probably tomorrow will be my day to die
2452418 i thought my parents were already dead i had to start another family i became happy there again
2452419 if you get a piece of chicken merry christmas to you
2452420 i said i want to be as fast as that guy i want to run for that country i want to wear that same uniform he knew it was impossible
2452421 there wasnt a guarantee you would get a chance to go to the free world
2452422 you will be watching me in the olympics in beijing
2452423 seven years before i was in a refugee camp i dont even have a word for it
2452424 there are a lot of holes out here that are almost unplayable
2452425 it can get a little ridiculous i could definitely see where some criticism of the layout is coming from and ive been playing well
2452426 i dont think its real fair when you hit good shots and in some cases get penalized for them
2452427 i think there should be some tough holes but i dont think it should be i hit a perfect shot and make a double bogey no it shouldnt be like that
2452428 when i got here i called home and said this is the hardest course ive ever played
2452429 if i were to play it every day i dont know if i would enjoy it
2452430 if you get it in the rough its more luck than skill from there
2452431 its a constant grind i saw the scoreboard before i played and if you didnt play youd be at the top by the end
2452432 i feel like im a really good spot you have to tell yourself that everyones playing the same course so it doesnt matter you just have to accept it i dont see the conditions really improving for scoring
2452433 if your game is not quite on the mark these sort of tournaments really find you out
2452434 the harder i tried the worse it got im obviously still having a hangover but im quite happy with the consequences of winning another open if this is it
2452435 im not going to throw him right back in there i can tell you that
2452436 i havent had a chance to talk to him since this visit
2452437 theres a game plan when he gets here in terms of what is going to happen purely from a medical perspective
2452438 beyond that im sure andy has a creative plan in terms of the football part of it
2452439 the deal is fairly cap neutral to this particular year
2452440 i think it increased it a bit but nothing that would change anything we were thinking or any flexibility we would want to have it changes the cap numbers obviously over the next three four or five years it is moderately more next year significantly more in year three
2452441 we are not optimistic that he will pitch in 2008
2452442 but we really would like to have lews opinion on things because hes familiar with tom any time tom has had elbow problems hes pretty much seen lew i think lew is real familiar with his makeup and the kind of things that are going on i think after monday we can get that opinion we can really lay out a solid plan of care
2452443 i think right now flash is just trying to gather his information and figure out what is best for him
2452444 we have not talked about surgery nobody has even mentioned whether he is having surgery i think for him right now this probably just a little overwhelming to get it all in and figure out where hes heading
2452445 i drove a little faster to get home and pack last night and had no problem getting up at 6 45
2452446 my wife kicked me out of bed this morning she didnt even drive me to the airport she got a car for me
2452447 we want him to go down and start on a regular basis
2452448 this time of the year and where were at its hard to get him work and develop in our bullpen
2452449 hes a starter and like i told him today he could be a good self evaluator and see how much hes improved hes going to be a starter in this league and its more than likely going to be with us
2452450 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2452451 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2452452 hes had a good deal of success in this division
2452453 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york
2452454 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2452455 i wanted to make sure everything they said was in there was in there
2452456 i think it stacks up pretty well with other top running backs salaries we wanted to be in the top paid and this contract did that its a big burden off my chest
2452457 this took endless hours lots of nights until midnight 1 in the morning
2452458 brian gave me three areas that were important to him he told me when the deal was done wed either met or exceeded all three
2452459 we set a timeline with the team not a deadline
2452460 we didnt want him to play without having a contract
2452461 its a complicated deal everything ive ever seen is in this deal
2452462 i think this is the most complicated contract ive ever seen not just that ive ever done i read at least a synopsis of every contract done in the league and frequently try to look at the entire contract
2452463 we think of dawkins as a hall of fame caliber player i feel like im standing up here again right before the first preseason game of the season were talking about a hall of fame caliber player
2452464 thats what drove him its what has always driven him if you put the same things i said about dawkins a few years ago if you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team in who they are in their heart in their head that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2452465 hes going to come in he had another meeting yesterday with his doctor i think hell be in in the next little bit here
2452466 i feel like rutgers is a place where i can really improve as a player
2452467 and its a program on the rise one that has a chance at competing for a national title its going to be exciting to be a part of that
2452468 we dont use that word frustrated weve been on the other side where we are always down looking up trying to win a game only just to stay a game back were on the opposite side of that were still in first place we have to keep looking forward and go out there tomorrow and get a win
2452469 its kind of like it wasnt meant for us to score
2452470 so hindi po totoo wala pong katotohanan na babalik ako ng gma 7 happy naman po ako rito bilang kapamilya marami naman pong blessing na dumarating
2452471 so hindi po totoo wala pong katotohanan na babalik ako ng gma 7 happy naman po ako rito bilang kapamilya marami naman pong blessing na dumarating
2452472 hindi naman kasi it wasnt naman really naririnig ko lang usap usapan pero wala namang formal offer at saka dito sa
2452473 hindi ko talaga alam kung bakit may ganoong isyu kasi like kapag may mga corporate events kapag nagho host ako siguro may ilang executives kakausapin nila ko and they will say hey youre so pretty in
2452474 so far wala pa naman akong nae encounter na may mga d o m na nag o offer
2452475 handa na ko sa magiging isyu pero okey lang kasi kung malinis naman ang kunsensiya ko na wala akong d o m i dont have to worry about everything
2452476 hindi naman sa boyfriend siyempre i date lumalabas din paminsan minsan pero wala naman kasi talaga kong boyfriend kaya hindi ko iniisip yun or mangyayari sa akin yun at saka love ko yung trabaho ko no
2452477 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2452478 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2452479 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2452480 there are no indications at the moment that the rebels are pulling out of aleosan
2452481 we wanted to reposition our forces but we cannot because militias are firing on our fighters philippine authorities should stop these attacks
2452482 we are for peace but peace cannot stay long if it is being threatened by those who oppose it we want peace to reign the milf is optimistic the fighting will stop we are appealing to everyone to support peace in mindanao
2452483 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2452484 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2452485 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2452486 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2452487 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2452488 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2452489 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2452490 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2452491 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2452492 ich konnte dem bundestrainer keine garantie mehr geben dass ich ber das eine jahr hinaus f r das ich beim vfb stuttgart einen vertrag habe noch fu ball spielen werde
2452493 insofern habe ich ihm und andreas k pke vorgeschlagen dass sie f r die deutsche nationalmannschaft nicht mehr mit mir planen
2452494 es war ein sehr gutes gespr ch wir haben in der beurteilung der situation absolut auf einer wellenl nge gelegen ich habe mich bei jens f r gro artige leistungen in der nationalmannschaft bedankt
2452495 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2452496 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2452497 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2452498 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2452499 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2452500 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2452501 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2452502 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2452503 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2452504 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2452505 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2452506 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2452507 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2452508 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2452509 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2452510 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2452511 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2452512 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2452513 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2452514 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2452515 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2452516 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2452517 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2452518 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2452519 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2452520 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2452521 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2452522 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2452523 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2452524 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2452525 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2452526 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2452527 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2452528 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2452529 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2452530 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2452531 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2452532 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

2452572 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2452573 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

2452580 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2452581 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

2452624 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2452625 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

2452627 rapids water park posted the appropriate signs with instructions that were consistent with the manufacturers guidelines
2452628 it is indisputable that the patrons exceeded weight limits for the raft additionally they were not positioned correctly in the raft for proper weight distribution
2452629 all members of the family felt due to long lines for this slide that the lifeguards sat them in the tube and kicked them down the slide without any instructions or comments about restrictions
2452630 the lifeguard did state to the park that he did reposition them the best he could without physically knowing their weight
2452631 but if you have a lineup of a large number of people it might be difficult to tell the weight difference between people that size when there is a 20 pound weight difference
2452632 in this case you had people who by their own admission greatly exceeded the weight limit
2452633 the question is what role and responsibility if any does the park have other than putting out warning signs on the ride that these are the weight limits and this is how it is to be distributed
2452634 people get larger rides get faster and more thrill seeking and all of these require all the more vigilance on the part of the patrons to follow instructions and all the more vigilance on the part of the park personnel to see that they are followed
2452635 the average balance for our clients for all those combined cards is about 17 000 in just unsecured credit card debt

2452639 in den letzten 20 jahren hat es eine revolution in der fr herkennung und behandlung der b sartigen hodentumoren gegeben
2452640 wie f r alle anderen b sartigen erkrankungen gilt auch hier je fr her der tumor erkannt wird desto gr er sind die heilungschancen
2452641 leider nur etwa 16 prozent der m nner und 34 prozent der frauen in deutschland daran teil

2452643 die f nf tage bis zum von der gyn kologin hastig organisierten termin waren eine achterbahn der angst
2452644 ich wusste dass das in meinem alter h ufig vorkommt dass sich in seltenen f llen aus diesen kalkablagerungen krebs entwickeln kann und war zun chst nur m ig beunruhigt
2452645 erst als der radiologe mich v llig verst rt beim verlassen der praxis abfing und in sein zimmer zur ck bat geriet ich in heftige panik weil ich dachte er h tte doch noch etwas schlimmes entdeckt
2452646 leider machen die wenigsten m nner von der m glichkeit der krebsfr herkennung gebrauch

2452668 would the new kadugu maangai pickle be ready to eat
2452669 we are dismayed by the actions of three players not doing the right things by themselves and their club in preparation for a big match
2452670 we are furious that a player would drink and drive we are disappointed that the players would lie to us it might be understandable but its not acceptable
2452671 football saves far more than it loses but we must continue to try to make every player who comes in contact with the collingwood football club better for the experience
2452672 i believe weve been able to do that in just about every example ive seen if not all cases
2452673 hes going saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa
2452674 zanu pf has been put into a corner by domestic and international pressure and that corner is shrinking

2452676 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2452677 it will not be realistic or feasible for now to leave mugabe out completely from the political scene
2452678 the original soundtrack album from the mgm picture double trouble
2452679 we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon
2452680 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2452681 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastien leto cannot get a work permit
2452682 ryan babel is away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area
2452683 who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder
2452684 maybe he can play in three different positions that is a positive thing i am talking about one player but i wont say the name
2452685 i will try to improve the team and the squad if i can
2452686 i am pleased because we have not lost again i will try to do my best to improve the squad
2452687 so i have two points here 1 most of us are eating more than we think that may be why you arent losing as planned or at all 2 people who claim to be starving themselves with 900 calories a day arent they are really eating 1100 if you combine this knowledge with how most people also overestimate their caloric burn during exercise its a recipe for disaster

2452722 the historical anomaly of dioceses that have nothing to do with the black community going all the way to africa to make these relationships
2452723 this is just another revisionist attempt to use anything to undermine the orthodox position of the church and spread the agenda of inclusiveness
2452724 as a person who knows what it means to be oppressed i refuse to allow my brothers and sisters in the faith to be discriminated against
2452725 very inappropriate to equate the struggle of blacks in africa or in the diaspora
2452726 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2452727 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran and to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2452728 the continuation of arrests in the west bank is clearly showing that president mahmoud abbas is not interested in launching a comprehensive national dialogue to end the current crisis
2452729 my views developed in the course of time but i have always believed in what i did and never acted against it
2452730 the soviet government had let the genie out of the bottle and however hard they tried later they couldnt put it back in
2452731 russia can neither be grasped by the mind nor measured by any common yardstick no attitude to her other than one of blind faith is admissible
2452732 broke russias back the red terror unleashed by its leaders their willingness to drown russia in blood is the first and foremost proof of it
2452733 the bitter russian experience which i have been studying and describing all my life will be for us a lesson that keeps us from new disastrous breakdowns
2452734 this is the first nonstate radio broadcast in china since the communist party took power in 1949
2452735 we lost the battle for a boycott of the opening ceremony but that does not mean that we will keep quiet
2452736 we are protesting against the chinese governments failure to live up to the undertakings it made seven years ago when it made its bid to host the olympics
2452737 if we talk more about human rights in china today it is because of protests like this
2452738 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2452739 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2452740 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2452741 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2452742 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2452743 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2452744 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2452745 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2452746 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2452747 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2452748 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2452749 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2452750 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2452751 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2452752 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2452753 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2452754 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project

2452757 i have never met putin but i know mikhail saakashvili well i first hosted a meal for the two of us in the house of common twelve years ago

2452823 forse ha spiegato da casa non tutti se ne sono accorti ma la medaglia doro tra le tv piu sprecone del mondo e gia nostra un esempio per tutti calcio olimpico argentina costa davorio in campo telecronaca di antinelli con commento tecnico di aurelio capaldi a raisport si sono inventati il giornalista nel ruolo di commentatore tecnico un escamotage per portare allambita trasferta di pechino due giornalisti laddove ne sarebbe bastato uno solo per accontentare coloro che sarebbero rimasti a roma a guardare le olimpiadi alla tv ecco il trucchetto del commento tecnico affidato ad un giornalista e non ad un ex campione sportivo un allenatore o di un esperto che si e distinto in quella disciplina come logica imporrebbe
2452824 pronta linterrogazione per conoscere quanti siano i giornalisti che hanno vinto il viaggio premio in cina e quanto peseranno sulle spalle dei contribuenti solo per sentire perle di saggezza come il gol dellargentina decisivo a 4 minuti dalla fine e un gol importante oppure messi e un gran giocatore
2452825 we are dismayed by the actions of three players not doing the right things by themselves and their club in preparation for a big match
2452826 we are furious that a player would drink and drive we are disappointed that the players would lie to us it might be understandable but its not acceptable
2452827 football saves far more than it loses but we must continue to try to make every player who comes in contact with the collingwood football club better for the experience
2452828 i believe weve been able to do that in just about every example ive seen if not all cases
2452829 because the media wants blood doesnt mean we should make decisions based on public relations

2452831 zanu pf has been put into a corner by domestic and international pressure and that corner is shrinking
2452832 a settlement will be reached but what remains to be seen is whether the agreement can be implemented a formula has to be found to mix oil and water
2452833 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2452834 it will not be realistic or feasible for now to leave mugabe out completely from the political scene
2452835 story has proven to be true and there is more to come
2452836 i only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby i also have not been engaged in any kind of activity of any description that requested agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby
2452837 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2452838 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2452839 georgian military forces completely control all the territory of south ossetia
2452840 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2452841 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located

2452845 what those experiences did is give me a negative way of looking at myself
2452846 now the first thing i think when i see a pretty girl is man i cant talk to her
2452847 its very hard for young men to not dive into dating when its so much more accessible and easy to do
2452848 were expected to live like monks and not everyone can do that i believe that if its this difficult to get married now then our kids and their kids are just going to give up on the whole thing and have relationships western style
2452849 if you view marriage as just having sex in a halal way this is not a good enough reason to get married
2452850 the prophet directed another hadith to men that if a man does not possess the bare minimum to get married financially socially physically and emotionally then they should fast
2452851 if a guy is just strolling in life doesnt know yet what to do and is still young he is not ready to get married
2452852 todays sexual explosion is very frustrating especially for single young brothers
2452853 physical needs are an important part of marriage but at the same time next to physical needs come the bills sisters have the right to ensure that her future husband will be able to look after her and her childrens needs
2452854 i strongly believe that fathers doing this are committing a major sin
2452855 as the prophet described it it will be a fitna a huge social problem that will never end
2452856 she seemed to be waiting around the place almost as if she wanted me to say something but i just didnt know how to approach her
2452857 was she interested or was it just my imagination i didnt want to make it seem like i was hitting on her because it would probably turn her off it was mind boggling and disappointing because i didnt know what to do
2452858 we in southern california pride ourselves on our big muslim community but young singles dont interact much
2452859 isnt it strange that one friend of mine got married to a girl from canada and the other got married to a girl from the uk
2452860 traditionally there was a forum facilitated through mothers sisters cousins friends of the family and was conducted in a healthy environment
2452861 many men here dont have such connections even a young college student who attends the msa or a masjid once a week still does not find a healthy medium to find the potential wife
2452862 lots of times i felt like there were too few sisters to marry the same four or five sisters would get recommended to me all the time sisters complain there are too few brothers but i know so many brothers who want to get married there are a lot of good sisters and brothers out there but for whatever reason theyre not connecting
2452863 im not thinking about finding a wife your generation is living that narrative
2452864 come up with ideas on how to find a spouse and then ask community leaders can we do this these things need to be covered by the younger community but with guidance from pastoral scholarly figures
2452865 there are girls and boys who may be suitable for each other but they may not be aware so someone has to introduce them
2452866 most parents want doctors engineers lawyers or computer experts who have very high incomes
2452867 the girls mostly want someone tall handsome good looking or guys with charisma
2452868 having extremely high worldly standards not giving importance to religion and character not willing to marry their children until they complete college and refusing to accept the choice of their children
2452869 most people perceive marriage to be just a social obligation rather than a religious one
2452870 i feel that our girls and boys as well as their parents need to be more aware and educated about the status of marriage in islam and take it seriously
2452871 if you look at any problem in the life of the prophet there was always a communal solution to a problem we need to function in that way of a support group
2452872 rhetoric has to be created by active people in our communities
2452873 we cant give one khutbah or speech and expect a solution we need opportunities like workshops or town halls that for example enlighten parents how difficult it is to get married

2452882 there are lots of volunteers being gathered in the region and its very hard to withhold them from taking part a real war is going on
2452883 i want to reiterate on president bushs behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire
2452884 we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict we are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue
2452885 towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict
2452886 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2452887 the intense fighting in the south ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full fledged war
2452888 war would have a devastating impact for the entire region i urge the georgians south ossetians and russians to cease fire end military action and stop further escalation we need to pull back from the brink of a full fledged war
2452889 we are monitoring developments we urge an immediate cease fire in the fighting in and for a resumption of direct dialogue between all parties
2452890 battalion task forces have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces
2452891 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2452892 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done
2452893 the aggression launched by the georgian side against the south ossetian civilians and russian peacekeepers

2452903 the nadmo wishes to inform the general public especially communities living within the catchment areas of the white volta and its tributaries of the necessary precautionary measures to protect life and property in the event of any serious floods caused by the spillage
2452904 we should be deeply concerned that with less than two years to go before our deadline for universal access the g8 has committed little more than a third of the resources that it has promised to deliver by 2010
2452905 what we have is the sense of real slippage that well you know it may not be 2010 and it probably will be 2015 as if that doesnt matter
2452906 homosexuality is a crime so giving out condoms to inmates will mean endorsing their unlawful sexual activities the co ordinator of the ghana prisons service hiv aids control programme superintendent francis hagbe pointed out in an interview with the mirror
2452907 in addition to the states laws the prison service also has regulations procedures and sanctions on homosexual acts those found guilty may forfeit their remission
2452908 for instance if one is sentenced to a one year prison term it means one will be in prison for eight months according to prison regulations but if one is caught engaging in homosexual acts one may serve all the 12 months of the year
2452909 the sex education campaign is meant to help them to practice safe sex when they leave the prison
2452910 even if the laws were changed to allow prisoners to enjoy conjugal rights the prison service may not have the facilities to accommodate inmates and their visiting spouses to have intercourse
2452911 ghana had not reached a stage where prisoners could be made to enjoy conjugal rights
2452912 personally i do not think that they should have sex in jail
2452913 it is like saying that because people are visiting brothels we should legalise prostitution
2452914 it is only when they show symptoms of the disease that they may get tested
2452915 the prisons service provides anti retroviral drugs to hiv positive inmates as well as other health care services we also use print and audio visual materials to create awareness about the disease

2452933 the avenues to death are numerous and strange a london paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause he was playing at puff the dart which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted and blown at a target through a tin tube he placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force drew the needle into his throat it entered the lungs and in a few days killed him
2452934 is a contemptible falsehood a poor hoax the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny a liner of some wretched concoctor of accidents in cocaigne these fellows knowing the extravagant gullibility of the age set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities of odd accidents as they term them but to a reflecting intellect like mine
2452935 to a contemplative understanding such as i myself possess it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these odd accidents is by far the oddest accident of all for my own part i intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the singular about it

2452956 ik voelde me heel de week niet echt goed vooral de vermoeidheid speelde me parten
2452957 vandaag trainde ik beter al is de vochtigheid in china lastig
2452958 er zitten er heel veel dicht op elkaar voor die plaatsen bij de laatste 16 dus het zal ook afhangen van de vorm van de dag van de anderen
2452959 maar de voorbereiding is super verlopen en mijn tijden op training zijn ook supergoed zo goed zelfs dat ik soms bang ben we moeten die vorm nu gewoon proberen te concretiseren ik heb enorm hard naar deze spelen toegewerkt en hopelijk werpt dat nu zn vruchten af mijn doel is een halve finale maar daarvoor heb ik eerst een persoonlijk record nodig ik hoop op een tijd rond de 52 20
2452960 ik heb net enkele wedstrijdtempos gedaan met de rem op en ik zwom nog te snel maandag probeer ik gewoon een nieuwe persoonlijke besttijd te zwemmen nvdr zijn belgisch record staat op 1 56 86 en dan zien we wel waar ik strand momenteel sta ik 15e van alle deelnemers dus het zou toch moeten lukken op voorwaarde dat ik een nieuw record zwem
2452961 alles is er om een goed resultaat neer te zetten
2452962 op de 100m vrije slag zou een halve finale moeten lukken maar voor mezelf heb ik mijn contract vervuld als ik een belgisch record zwem nvdr zijn br bedraagt nu 49 09
2452963 een finale is voor een 19 jarige nog te hoog gegrepen waar ik nu momenteel nog aan werk is mijn start mijn eerste 30 meter zijn soms traag daarna sluit ik wel weer aan maar ik moet me forceren en dat kost natuurlijk energie we weten waaraan het ligt maar het is nooit eenvoudig om zoiets technisch te veranderen

2452975 you could tell two years ago you have to work to be good and she knows that and shes in a great program club wolverine with bob bowman and jon urbanchek but she is also a great racer she knows how to compete and thats one thing you cant teach
2452976 i guarantee you allison didnt think about the olympics she was just swimming and enjoying the sport and what a neat thing thats the way it should be then all of a sudden this winter and spring she realized she was a player and shes just getting faster
2452977 are you disappointed in third because in my own mind i was always thinking when i watched on television that third has to be the hardest place to be in
2452978 i dropped another 5 seconds from the omaha grand prix three weeks earlier i missed the team by a second and a half or something but it just motivates you my biggest focus of the meet was the 200 free that was supposedly my best chance of making the team and doing well in the 400 made me excited about how i could do in the 200
2452979 it was her mom and dad and allison just like always
2452980 there was no real difference we were just a family again and that was nice just another trip to the mall was she excited yes but its more a progression than a sudden excitement
2452981 i always like to keep stuff fun and exciting i hear people say oh we have to do this in training or this and that tomorrow but im doing this for fun im doing it to do my best and keep it fun for everyone
2452982 youre swimming with the best in the world right now
2452983 to get to experience this with them and be one of them its an amazing experience and process
2452984 virtually at every meet she swims she had that rip snorting swim at omaha before the trials and thats when everyone woke up and realized what she could do she somewhat burst on to the scene
2452985 shes going to be really on the hotseat in the 200 its an unbelievably competitive event
2452986 the best play well its going to be somebody on defense i can promise you we had one or two interceptions im trying to think of one where we didnt just throw it right to them
2452987 obviously i want to win this job very very badly
2452988 ill let the coaches decide that the media can decide who they think is the favorite or the underdog i dont pay attention to that i just go out there and compete and whether im the starter or the backup or even the third stringer you always prepare as if youre the starter
2452989 youre one snap away and god forbid you go in as a backup and youre not prepared to play im working my butt off to be the starter as is steve and well let the coaches decide
2452990 i dont want you jim carty being negative about u m football amp the new coach but its okay for me to be negative

2453000 id been two or three tenths faster in a meet i didnt taper for
2453001 not so much on kara lynn but on my end
2453002 its so funny how i just expected to make it last time and was like oh yeah im in four events
2453003 i thought this was going to be my big breakthrough year and id bust out a couple of olympic medals but now if i bring one home i can be extremely happy and ill bust my butt for the next four years to show what im really capable of doing

2453098 this thesis when it is finished ha will provide a critical analysis of how women are conceived within the development industry and how this affects understanding of and approaches to womens involvement in female infanticide and foeticide in india despite recent development gains in india the persistence of gender inequality appears to be worsening as expressed by the declining fmr in response to this the development initiatives aimed at redressing this man made sic phenomenon are premised on understandings that social cultural and structural constraints render women powerless participants in practices of female foeticide and infanticide in this context development initiatives explicitly targeted at empowering women and fostering their critical agency have been seen as the means to overcoming these constraints however it has recently been noted that typically empowered women those who are better educated and in the workforce are increasingly participating in practices of daughter discrimination bhat amp sharma 2006 the various aspects of son preference in india reveal a complex nexus of cultures religions traditions and economics and although it is beyond my scope to elucidate why empowerment gains for women in india have failed to translate into large scale challenge this phenomenon highlight potential limitations in the mainstream development perspective where womens identity becomes separated from social and cultural dimensions of son preference

2453124 conflict is not what we want to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideals stand for
2453125 the olympic truce is the heart of what our values stand for
2453126 it is a sad reality that a number of countries are in conflict
2453127 it is wrong to make any assessment here in perspective to the games

2453129 we will do something just as wonderful and just as extraordinary
2453130 beijing has done something absolutely stupendous that everyone there will remember for the rest of their lives it is our turn now and we look forward to it it is a huge challenge but it is one that we will rise to and emulate
2453131 every decade or so an olympics will capture the spirit of the age it is difficult to imagine what london will stand for in four years time when the world gather in stratford in east london for the celebration of the 30th olympiad
2453132 i am not sure how many countries would have either the resources or indeed the controlled resources to put on an event like this
2453133 i doubt we will have 20 000 people doing things in unison in our opening ceremony thats just fine thats the beauty of the contrast
2453134 boris johnson and his team will celebrate and then feel the pressure
2453135 beijing spent a mind blowing amount on the opening ceremony almost 3 000 pounds per second which is a sobering thought for all those london council taxpayers will 2012 top that financial outlay

2453141 well im a sell out its official ive had such an overwhelming response according to my stats on the vyatta router story linux is a platform not an os
2453142 there is one thing that many people have yet failed to realize and that is that linux is a platform not an os now as bizarre as we dont need another linux hater

2453144 you look at our roster and it is all players from junior colleges or players from colleges nobody ever heard of and they went out and beat teams that had players from florida florida state and miami
2453145 i had so much confidence in our coaching staff and in the owners and in the young men who were recruited to play for the mavericks
2453146 we had no big name players but we had a whole bunch of players who were heart and hustle kids
2453147 quite honestly we wanted to make sure the team that we put on the field wouldnt embarrass us
2453148 we didnt really know much about it i think we would have been totally happy with a break even year the one thing we didnt want was for the team to go 5 40
2453149 we wanted to make it a good experience for the kids who were out there when we hired steve we did it as kind of a courtesy interview for him because we knew he was so young the guy was not much older than the guys he would be coaching but he came in and he really struck us with his maturity i dont think we could have made a better choice
2453150 we didnt have an attitude problem at all with kids complaining about who was playing that was one thing that steve liked about the makeup of the team with the players from small colleges he felt the players would play more as a team and they did
2453151 beijing is a somewhat mysterious exotic location and backdrop for the games
2453152 there is interest because there are many subtexts to these games
2453153 the exotic political and cultural intrigue enhances an olympic template that always runs the risk of stagnating the environment of imprisonment public executions persecutions of religious and political groups risks of attack and political protest has aroused international attention people who normally have no interest in the games have taken a stance for political reasons
2453154 there is spectacle political intrigue the hopes and aspirations of the chinese government and the chinese people who want this to be a wonderful show but there are also fears of attack unpredictable political protests and the fear of violent crackdown by chinese security forces many things are coming to bear at once which heightens our sense of anticipation and anxiety

2453651 yesterday it was a monkey but today bananas will not do the trick now there are three greyhounds loose on the n11 northbound at the rathmichael exit
2453652 motorists are urged to drive with extreme care as one of the dogs has already been struck by a vehicle
2453653 over the years aa roadwatch has reported on loose horses loose cows loose sheep a loose duck loose chickens loose puppies deer and weve even had a camel that escaped from a local circus spotted on the side of a main road
2453654 aa traffic alert m1 cow on the far side of the city there is a loose cow on the m1 central reservation between extreme care is needed as onlookers are causing delays
2453655 a loose cow has been removed from the central median of the m1
2453656 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2453657 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2453658 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2453659 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2453660 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2453661 cunis its a funny name that neither one thing nor the other
2453662 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2453663 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2453664 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2453665 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2453666 por respeito s v timas e a sua fam lia n o daremos mais informa es a embaixada americana est cooperando ativamente com as autoridades chinesas para resolver este crime o mais rapidamente poss vel
2453667 unquestionably waterboarding is torture and we believe offends the convention and indeed if legislation is introduced would offend the legislation
2453668 it is a totally different course to the north west 200 or the tt like a proper grand prix on roads
2453669 it has fast corners slow corners hard braking slow braking and blind apex corners its a real riders circuit and one that all real road racers enjoy
2453670 at the north west its important to have the fastest bike but you dont have to be on the quickest machine to win at the ulster
2453671 there are so many corners and so many braking points that you can ride harder at the ulster to make up for a of power and speed
2453672 a place you have to love in order to go fast
2453673 the circuits suits guy as he is a rider who tries hard and to win at the ulster you have to ride hard go fast and be very exact
2453674 cameron donald is another who should go well as he has good form from the tt and is capable of really scratching on fast courses whether it be on the roads or on the british short circuits
2453675 ian hutchinson won in the wet last year and he is also used to hard track riding every week on the circuits which is what you really need to be doing
2453676 john mcguinness hasnt really hit it off as he would like at the grand prix but given his performances on the isle of man and the fact that he has won some races at dundrod and is the course lap record holder he can never be discounted
2453677 bruce anstey has hardly raced since the tt but he has loads of talent and should weigh in with a victory or two again
2453678 ryan has got good bikes from millsport and kenny harker and you must remember that alistair seeley won on one of the millsport bikes at the north west 200 and went well on the rest so they are very competitive
2453679 when ryan has got the right bikes and gets his head right he can win races hes a good wet weather rider too which is also a bonus with the unpredictable weather at dundrod
2453680 william and michael have had a good teacher in their dad robert but they need to keep up the consistency and move onto a slightly different level to compete with the big boys in the main classes
2453681 adrian archibald is another who enjoys racing at dundrod and should do well but i suspect his days of winning are over
2453682 new blood in the form of conor cummins gary johnson and keith amor making an impression
2453683 we need new riders of that calibre to come through if road racing is to survive and have a bright future
2453684 at the opposite end of the scale you have ian lougher who has been around for ages but is still a really good road racer and cant be counted out
2453685 some of the younger riders should just have the edge over him but its exciting that you have at least six guys capable of winning each race
2453686 every thought is a seed if you plant crab apples dont count on harvesting golden delicious
2453687 anyone can count the seeds in an apple but only god can count the number of apples in a seed
2453688 to interact with a variety of sl teachers students and researchers attend virtual field trips plan and conduct workshops build out teaching resources for other educators and work on individualized projects and research this is a wonderful opportunity to become part of the emerging network of virtual world educators

2453690 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2453691 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2453692 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2453693 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2453694 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2453695 as the victim of nuclear bombs our country has a duty and responsibility for taking the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons
2453696 the japanese government must strongly demand complete abolishment of nuclear weapons in north korea
2453697 it should seriously consider the creation of a northeast asian nuclear weapon free zone
2453698 india whose nuclear cooperation with the united states is a cause of concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2453699 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2453700 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2453701 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2453702 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2453703 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2453704 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2453705 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2453706 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2453707 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2453708 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2453709 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2453710 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2453711 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2453712 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2453713 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2453714 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2453715 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2453716 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2453717 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2453718 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2453719 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2453720 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2453721 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2453722 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2453723 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2453724 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2453725 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2453726 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2453727 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2453728 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2453729 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2453730 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2453731 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2453732 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2453733 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2453734 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2453735 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2453736 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2453737 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2453738 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2453739 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2453740 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2453741 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2453742 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2453743 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2453744 as a result silvercorps mining operations in its ying mining camp in luoyang city henan province have experienced approximately 13 4 down time during the month of july the total power down time in july was approximately 100 hours for mines and mills or about 3 22 hour per day in addition during the first 8 days of august silvercorp experienced 32 down time losing about 60 hours or 7 5 hours per day it is expected that during the olympic games period ending september 5th the average down time will remain about 7 5 hours to 14 hours per day
2453745 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2453746 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2453747 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2453748 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2453749 fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2453750 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2453751 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia this is a clear intrusion we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2453752 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished those guilty will receive due punishment
2453753 many russian volunteers intended to go to south ossetia and he putin said it was very difficult to maintain peace in the region
2453754 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2453755 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2453756 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2453757 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2453758 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2453759 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2453760 before enlightenment chop wood and carry water after enlightenment chop wood and carry water
2453761 men make counterfeit money in many more cases money makes counterfeit men
2453762 only love can be divided endlessly and still not diminish
2453763 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2453764 are we the end product or are we still evolving
2453765 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2453766 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2453767 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2453768 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2453769 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2453770 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2453771 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2453772 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2453773 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2453774 who are open to doing something on the production side
2453775 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2453776 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2453777 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2453778 through these tactical offensives we would like to make it clear that xstrata smi must leave the area as we will not allow it to continue to plunder our own natural resources
2453779 we played a gig at g a y and guess who he pulled points to dougie properly pulled
2453780 she introduced us on stage it was the last night so celebrities were there
2453781 there was paps there i didnt want many pictures so i tried to cover it up thinking it would be a kiss on the cheek
2453782 i didnt think shed want to kiss me and i thought shed kiss me on the lips and she proper went in i was grinning so she was probably licking my teeth it was a good kiss a very horny kiss
2453783 viruses cost businesses and consumers billions of dollars in the long run unless the government steps in and takes drastic steps the problem will continue

2454044 as the tip is brought sufficiently close to its counterelectrode within a few angstroms using electrostatic force generated by the bottom detection electrode a tunneling current i is established and remains constant if the tunneling voltage v and distance between the tip and counterelectrode are unchanged once the proof mass is displaced due to acceleration the readout circuit responds to the change of current and adjusts the bottom detection voltage to move the proof mass back to its original position thus maintaining a constant tunneling current
2454045 silicon resonant accelerometers are generally based on transferring the proof mass inertial force to axial force on the resonant beams and hence shifting their frequency

2454333 we face the same challenges as anyone else an explosion in the amount of data the growth in power consumption the lack of skilled people to manage it to match the growth in compute demand and the density of computing
2454334 which means well run out of power long before we run out of floor space in our data centers
2454335 which is 1 5 percent of all energy consumed in the u s
2454336 we need to do something about our ability to meet the needs of it or well be crippled in infrastructure
2454337 were approaching the airline industry in terms of our impact on environment energy has become the second biggest component of cost within our datacenters after labor
2454338 we invest about one percent of our equipment in spares so we can hot swap when a server fails
2454339 the only way you can handle this is to highly automate the process
2454340 we needed to be able to answer a simple question like whos my customer
2454341 decided to have only one organization for business processes in functional areas like human resources
2454342 we put in a single global business instance for supporting all business functions worldwide
2454343 this with collaboration and self service gave us one global organization
2454344 we couldnt have consolidated the 50 operational companies we bought and realized the synergies from those purchases without having standardized everything both the infrastructure and the process
2454345 leverage our hardware and network more effectively and enables rapid deployment using grid techniques
2454346 is to have a physical environment which i run largely as a pool or cluster of virtual machines
2454347 are not linux and they account for 90 percent of our support and maintenance costs

2454355 this is the kick in the butt i needed to crank out a film every 4 months
2454356 so semicon was last week and some co workers and i went over here to grab some dinner
2454357 anyone who says they hang out in bernal heights either lives there or theyre lying
2454358 oh you know just rode up cortland whatre you up to
2454359 do you live in la ill move there for you
2454360 you made a mistake by booking a ticket on this airline
2454361 i made it through the wilderness somehow i made it through ooh hoo
2454362 thats it this is what ive been saving myself for
2454363 to take the pressure off people who are new on the floor
2454364 that guys hair isnt too long but isnt too short its right in between
2454365 i want to keep my hair not long not short but somewhere right in between so that if you saw me on the street youd say that guys hair isnt too long but isnt too short
2454366 aside from killing people with lightning quick roundhouse kicks to the head a la chuck norris i play four square guitar and uke
2454367 that dress is absolutely hideous if i wanted to blackmail my bridesmaids id make them take pictures in this
2454368 lets take a look at the rest and see what you think
2454369 im planning on wearing flip flops but the ballet slippers should be fine
2454370 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
2454371 go figure im supposed to choke on this a fish scale in the tuna the one i ordered
2454372 thats too bad i used to like this sushi place
2454373 tonight the hawks organization received an offer sheet from the memphis grizzlies for josh smith
2454374 we are happy to announce that we will match their offer sheet ownership management and the team are happy to have josh return as a member of the hawks we look forward to training camp in october and we will continue to look at additional opportunities to improve our roster
2454375 one of my biggest concerns has been injuries how that could just dash away all kinds of planning and of course to have a player go down like dwyane wade one of the real premier players in the world that raised some real questions hes been really injured for two years
2454376 i saw a couple of explosive things but he wasnt back yet
2454377 he was really refocused on coming back and proving to people that he could
2454378 because some people doubted that and i suggested to him he create a little bit of an edge
2454379 and i didnt have to sell myself he just saw that i had the eye of the tiger and i was ready to go
2454380 there was no doubt in my mind he would be ready
2454381 so before we even got here i already knew he was gonna be ready he promised me that he was gonna be ready so what hes doing now is not a surprise to me
2454382 i dont think he would come out this summer if he wasnt healthy
2454383 and if hes healthy we know what kind of basketball hes capable of playing so we expected that before we even started
2454384 the way hes getting to the basket right now is unbelievable theres nobody right now that can stay in front of him
2454385 not only the athletes but the fans at beach volleyball have freedom freedom to dance and clap and cheer and to just lose the long sleeved shirts and ties for a weekend
2454386 i grew up on the beach i dont understand what the big deal is when im at the beach im not wearing sweat pants
2454387 and each afternoon they herd the cows down the middle of the main street
2454388 not only the athletes but the fans at beach volleyball have freedom freedom to dance and clap and cheer and to just lose the long sleeved shirts and ties for a weekend
2454389 i grew up on the beach i dont understand what the big deal is when im at the beach im not wearing sweat pants
2454390 and each afternoon they herd the cows down the middle of the main street
2454391 in competition spectators response must be in harmony with the match progresses at the time of drive audience must keep silence but at the time of base running audience should cheer to inspire athletes fighting spirit

2454393 its only important to win the gold in the olympics if you win second or finish last its the same
2454394 i scored 399 to get to the final and im satisfied with it but as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2454395 and all she said was i just wanted to tell you how sorry i am for the cross firing and i thought you were the real winner i wish you luck in the future
2454396 that was really meaningful especially from someone i really admired in the sport not so much her achievements but the way she played the game and she was cute too
2454397 its only important to win the gold in the olympics if you win second or finish last its the same
2454398 i scored 399 to get to the final and im satisfied with it but as for the final i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2454399 and all she said was i just wanted to tell you how sorry i am for the cross firing and i thought you were the real winner i wish you luck in the future
2454400 that was really meaningful especially from someone i really admired in the sport not so much her achievements but the way she played the game and she was cute too

2454403 hes going saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa
2454404 zanu pf has been put into a corner by domestic and international pressure and that corner is shrinking
2454405 a settlement will be reached but what remains to be seen is whether the agreement can be implemented a formula has to be found to mix oil and water
2454406 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2454407 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2454408 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2454409 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2454410 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2454411 two tenths of one percent of visits to flickr are to upload new photos
2454412 the savings can be significant you can save anywhere from 25 to 75 per pc per year by using the power management features on your pc
2454413 the marginal production cost of software is zero thats what the price should be
2454414 it has become accepted that this type of service should be free and be supported by advertising
2454415 so giving away 100 copies for free costs us nothing
2454416 there are way better ways to market this type of software at the point in time they find themselves

2454418 the second i tasted it i was hooked i have been so much more active since trying ultra lean green and as a result i have lost over 50 lbs you could say that i have tried everything and i am sticking with this good flavors too
2454419 if it wasnt for ultra lean green i would probably still be telling myself that i am going to lose weight some day well i have really done it and i have never felt better i look forward to my morning drink and its so yummy thank you
2454420 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2454421 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2454422 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2454423 enerzijds ben ik heel blij dat ik nu in europa speel
2454424 mijn droom is nu werkelijkheid geworden ik heb zelfs even kunnen proeven van de champions league helaas is het niet gelopen zoals ik me had voorgesteld ik ben erg ontgoocheld met ons resultaat
2454425 er werd vaak met de lange bal gespeeld dat is niet echt mijn spel liever speel ik achter een diepe spits en krijg ik ballen van de flanken ik ben niet helemaal tevreden met wat ik tot nu toe heb laten zien maar ik weet dat ik nog veel vooruitgang kan boeken

2454447 devo dirti che spesso con le donne ho lo stesso rapporto e approccio che ho con i libri
2454448 its everywhere i will be after i walk for two weeks
2454449 i have lived in the same place for a long time it is time for me to go someplace else
2454450 i do not want to go wake up in the same old bed and eat breakfast in the same old kitchen every room in my house is the same old room because i have lived there too long
2454451 and you look at me and think same old face same old tail same old scales same old walk same old talk
2454452 i like your face tail scales walk and talk i like you
2454453 its everywhere i will be after i walk for two weeks
2454454 i have lived in the same place for a long time it is time for me to go someplace else
2454455 i do not want to go wake up in the same old bed and eat breakfast in the same old kitchen every room in my house is the same old room because i have lived there too long
2454456 and you look at me and think same old face same old tail same old scales same old walk same old talk
2454457 i like your face tail scales walk and talk i like you
2454458 they meet this old couple who should have gotten married like 40 years ago they are getting married now in vegas which inspires greenlee to not waste any more time
2454459 and it just so happens that ryan annie kendall and zach show up
2454460 isnt that odd call me crazy but arent there like a thousand chapels in vegas
2454461 theres a moment where we think he might stop the wedding but he doesnt
2454462 then they all go gambling and there is a sort of reception they all hang out together and go dancing right there in the casino
2454463 aidan has set up the whole room full rose petals and they make love
2454464 i think she just wants what everyone else has happiness and aidan gives her that
2454465 she is convincing herself she doesnt feel anything for ryan because hes married in her mind he is off limits she is going to move on with her life thats what i think anyway but i could get the next script and that could all change

2454470 in this competitive marketplace you have to separate yourself from other athletes and the taboo of posing for playboy or modelling has started to wane
2454471 people hardly batted an eyelid when amanda beard appeared in playboy but 10 or 15 years ago this would have caused much more of an uproar in the united states
2454472 modelling is a way for me to continue with my sport the hours are flexible and you can earn good money through photographic modelling and the catwalk
2454473 ultimately it does not get away from the fact that you have to be an athlete first and a beauty second

2454476 we have done a good job on saving the patients saving the kids
2454477 we are making progress in second stage rehabilitation but for the field of psychological support for those kinds of kids we have still a long way to go
2454478 to give the children a chance to get together is very important
2454479 so i hope someday we can do something to help our kids with burns
2454480 its been a fun experience even though its been rainy and everything
2454481 everyone is on the same level and nobody judges you here
2454482 ive been going to camp since i was eight so over the years ive been able to build up my confidence
2454483 but its nice to be able to help the younger kids who are still coming out of their shells

2454488 we allowed them to continue until late in the evening midnight at the latest
2454489 they left us with little choice weve directed them to get their work in line with approved plans
2454490 we didnt want to do this construction and tear up the new streets
2454491 were going to make sure for the future we dont have a collision like this again
2454492 centerpoint and downtown merchants both have jobs to do and they should find neutral ground and both work together
2454493 i have no reason to be believe that the public is in any danger
2454494 its just so far outside the realm of what i consider possible
2454495 its not going to kill you but itll ruin your weekend
2454496 but the jockeys who ride him have been a bit more frustrating ill tell you that
2454497 this little bloke mehmet won on him at moonee valley in a 1500 a fair while ago
2454498 when he had 53 today i thought id claim the three kilos
2454499 and theres not too many jockeys who can claim three kilos that can ride
2454500 i gave him pretty explicit instructions and he did a good job he carried them out
2454501 things usually always open up its only a matter of waiting for it
2454502 the other day at moonee valley with newitt aboard he was at his top half a mile from home and he cant win like that
2454503 as long as he keeps winning at those sorts of odds i will he happy

2454520 isnt it one great precaution not to let them taste of arguments while they are young i suppose you arent unaware that when lads get their first taste of them they misuse them as though it were play always using them to contradict and imitating those men by whom they are refuted they themselves refute others like puppies enjoying pulling and tearing with arguments at those who happen to be near
2454521 wouldnt be willing to participate in such madness he will imitate the man who is willing to discuss and consider the truth rather than the one who plays and contradicts for the sake of the game and he himself will be more sensible and will make the practice of discussion more honorable instead of more dishonorable
2454522 we too were quite clever indeed at things of this sort when we were your age for we too practiced such things and made precisely the sort of sophisticated arguments that you in my opinion are now practicing
2454523 as soon as they supposed themselves to be superior to the other citizens they no longer came to socrates
2454524 to make the city safe for philosophy nicomachean ethics book 10
2454525 it must not escape our notice that there is a difference between reasonings from first principles and reasonings to first principles now we ought to begin from what is known
2454526 it seems to me antiphon that you identify happiness with luxury and extravagance but i have always thought that to need nothing is divine and to need as little as possible is the nearest approach to the divine and that what is divine is best and what is nearest to the divine is the next best
2454527 he said that socrates met him freshly bathed and wearing fancy slippers which was not socrates usual way and he asked socrates where he was going so that he had become so beautiful kalos
2454528 your socrates has retreated into a neighbors porch and stands there and when i called him he was unwilling come in
2454529 if i say that this happens to be the greatest good for a human being to make speeches everyday about virtue and the other things about which you hear me conversing and examining both myself and others and that the unexamined life is not worth living for a human being you will be persuaded by me still less when i say these things this is the way it is as i affirm men but to persuade you is not easy
2454530 i did not go into matters where if i did go i was going to be of no benefit either to you or myself instead i went to each of you privately to perform the greatest benefaction as i affirm and i attempted to persuade each of you not to care for any of his own things until he cares for himself how he will be the best and most prudent possible not to care for the things of the city until he cares for the city itself and so to care for the other things in the same way
2454531 as for cloaks you know that people change them because of cold or hot weather and they wear shoes to prevent things from hurting their feet and so impeding their movements well have you ever known me stay indoors more than anybody else on account of the cold or compete with anyone for the shade on account of the heat or fail to walk wherever i wanted because my feet were sore dont you know that those who are physically weakest by nature if they train with a particular end in view become better able to achieve that end with less effort to themselves than the strongest athletes who neglect their training and if that is so dont you think that i who am always training myself to put up with the things that happen to my body find everything easier to bear than you do with your neglect of training
2454532 and once when the frost was the most terrible imaginable and no one went outdoors or if they did go out they wrapped themselves in an amazing number of garment and put on shoes and tied their feet in felt and sheepskins he went out among them with the same sort of mantel as he wore at any time and without shoes he marched through the ice more easily than the others did shod and the soldiers looked askance at him as if he were despising them and that is the way things were
2454533 i admire the courage and wisdom of socrates in everything he did said and did not say
2454534 also strongly encouraged his companions to be careful about their health and not only to learn all they could about it from those who knew but also to study their own constitutions throughout life to see what food or drink or what kind of exercise was good for them individually and by what use of these they could live the healthiest lives he said that anyone who observed himself in this way would find it hard to discover a doctor who could recognize what was good for his health better than he could himself
2454535 for i am a lover of learning philomathes now then the country places and the trees are not willing to teach me anything but the human beings in town are
2454536 it does not seem human on the one hand that i have been careless of all my things and that for so many years now i have endured that the things of my family be uncared for and on the other hand that i always do your business going to each of you privately as a father or an older brother might do persuading you to care for virtue if i was getting something out of this and if i was achieving pay while i exhorted you to these things it would be somewhat reasonable but as it is even you yourselves see that the accusers who accused me so shamelessly in everything else in this have not been able to become so utterly shameless as to offer a witness to assert that i ever took any pay or asked for it for i suppose i offer a sufficient witness that i speak the truth my poverty
2454537 it seems to me antiphon that you identify happiness with luxury and extravagance but i have always thought that to need nothing is divine and to need as little as possible is the nearest approach to the divine and that what is divine is best and what is nearest to the divine is the next best

2454713 the situation is not a question of money he is english and can play three different positions but i am talking about someone who can play on the left we have a good player alonso and we have another good player coming in soon we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can who comes in it could be another left sided player rather than a central midfielder maybe he can play in three different positions that is a positive thing i am talking about one player but i wont say the name
2454714 we are looking at three or four different options in the striking department which i hope will come to a happy conclusion hopefully we will have someone in for the start of the season

2454717 seem intent on playing more attractively than at any other time under rafa ben tez
2454718 he is widely hailed as one of britains most promising young bosses but could moving to manchester be the first really bad decision mark hughes has made as a manager
2454719 sir alex ferguson welcomed cristiano ronaldo back to manchester united yesterday with the offer of a contract extension for the errant winger and the intention to improve the champions armoury by signing a new striker before the season begins next weekend uniteds campaign officially opens against portsmouth tomorrow in the community shield but in terms of their most important business of the summer there was closure in the saga of ronaldos possible defection to real madrid at least for a year the 23 year old returned for a further assessment on his ankle injury and is due to resume training in a month
2454720 cheeky devil man united stars welcomed back cristiano ronaldo yesterday with a real madrid shirt the pranksters had his name and number 7 etched on to the kit and drew an x through it to signify he isnt heading to the spanish side
2454721 having seen off real madrids pursuit of cristiano ronaldo sir alex ferguson will now step up his attempt to ease the goal burden on his winger with a renewed bid for dimitar berbatov buoyed by the knowledge that bulgarian berbatov is desperate to move to old trafford and tottenham need the cash for new signings ferguson will this week improve the 20million offer that received a rejection slip and a mouthful of vitriol from daniel levy last month
2454722 alex ferguson aims to land dimitar berbatov in a 25million deal by the end of next week the manchester united boss has had a 22m bid rejected with tottenham wanting 30m united will go to 25m and believe that will be enough to secure the unsettled striker
2454723 the european champions this week hosted the nike premier cup a competition for the worlds leading under 15s and there could be no doubting the potential of some of the english ball players in the united team particularly in central midfield during a 4 1 thrashing of juventus
2454724 whatever else is said about tomorrows community shield match no one will call it a showcase the goods on display are not objects of fascination peter crouch is the single major signing by either team and with all due regard to the forward who has returned to fratton park after a six year absence he cannot be classified as exotica manchester united for the time being at least can live contentedly with the squad that won the premier league and champions league several of whom are injured or ill at present
2454725 the kop left rafael benitez in no doubt about what they thought of speculation that xabi alonso could be sold to fund a move for gareth barry one of the heroes of istanbul three years ago alonso was treated to a display of affection and support that the liverpool manager could not have failed to understand songs outlining what the anfield faithful felt about a deal for aston villa midfielder barry were frankly unrepeatable but the message was clear
2454726 the spanish midfielders name was chanted throughout the evening by the majority of a 43 000 crowd at anfield
2454727 liverpools owners george gillett and tom hicks have risked sparking another internal feud at anfield by refusing to back rafael ben tezs judgment on the 18m transfer of gareth barry
2454728 ben tez had to grin and bear it the first time after it had emerged that hicks and gillett had met j rgen klinsmann not once but twice with a view to the former germany coach now in charge at bayern munich taking over the reins at anfield whether he is prepared to stomach the ignominy of being embarrassed so publicly yet again however is an altogether different question
2454729 gokhan inler has moved closer to securing a transfer to arsenal after his agent revealed he had held productive talks with the manager ars ne wenger
2454730 its true to say that i have had a meeting with wenger and we had a very positive discussion
2454731 last night started his real madrid rebellion and declared i want to join chelsea to become the worlds best player sunsport told you yesterday the brazilian striker 24 was ready to revolt in order to force a move to stamford bridge and his agent wagner ribeiro launched a devastating attack on real saying robinho was furious with them
2454732 liverpool seem intent on playing more attractively than at any other time under rafa ben tez
2454733 he is widely hailed as one of britains most promising young bosses but could moving to manchester be the first really bad decision mark hughes has made as a manager
2454734 high profile casualties include freddie ljungberg ivan campo and patrik berger but mixed with those illustrious names are veteran journeymen aspiring teenagers and twenty somethings desperately trying to make a living julian joachim was released by darlington at the end of last season and according to the 33 year old former aston villa and leicester city striker the search for a new club gets more difficult with age
2454735 there are some great derby games in prospect in the east midlands south wales south yorkshire and london that adds to the unpredictability of the division as does the fact the transfer window still has three weeks to run but the championship is here and now buy your ticket to british footballs biggest lottery
2454736 the perfect antidote to premier league predictability the division in which 11 points separated the top eight sides last season and any of 14 can fancy themselves for a top six place this time around
2454737 even in the good old days when stan bowles and gerry francis were lighting up loftus road with their fancy feet and feathery mullets it was hard to imagine queens park rangers ever stealing top billing from the olympic games but as the new season looms and the sporting project hailed by qpr chairman flavio briatore as europes most exciting moves into its next phase the buzz around shepherds bush could power the floodlights
2454738 it is going to be tough when i look at the teams that have come down birmingham derby reading and the parachute money they have when i look at charlton and sheffield united uniteds reserves would be mid table when i look at wolves cardiff ipswich qpr who are throwing money around and watford and the promoted teams forest swansea and doncaster i think technically we should finish mid table but that is the challenge for me and the team once again we have to perform above ourselves i am delighted for doncaster william and i went to watch them several times when i was out of work last season they might be the team that surprises people theres always one
2454739 but for rangers two last minute championship wins in 2003 and 2005 celtic would be in pursuit of a ninth consecutive title when they kick off at home to st mirren on sunday
2454740 despite the disappointment it was a game played in a great spirit which may have been expected given the teams decision to share the prize money for the game given the leagues blinkered view of the bonus system clubs arent allowed to reward the players themselves it was a move of true solidarity by both clubs in an effort to show mls commissioner don garber that the players and the clubs also have a voice and deserve to be heard things may be changing

2454746 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2454747 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2454748 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2454749 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2454750 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2454751 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2454752 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2454753 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2454754 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2454755 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2454756 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2454757 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2454758 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2454759 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2454760 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2454761 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2454762 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2454763 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2454764 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2454765 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2454766 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2454767 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2454768 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2454781 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2454782 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2454783 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2454784 according to george lucas the franchise really depends on me coming up with a good idea and that series is very research intensive so were doing research now to see if we cant
2454785 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2454786 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2454787 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2454788 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2454789 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2454799 today is the day that we say welcome home to barack obama
2454800 i try to explain to them something about the aloha spirit i try to explain to them this basic idea that we all have obligations to each other that were not alone that if we see somebody whos in need we should help
2454801 most importantly that when you come from hawaii you start understanding that whats on the surface what people look like that doesnt determine who they are
2454802 and that the power and strength of diversity the ability of people from everywhere whether theyre black or white whether theyre japanese american or korean american or filipino american or whatever they are they are just americans that all of us can work together and all of us can join together to create a better country
2454803 its that spirit that im absolutely convinced is what america is looking for right now
2454804 i might go to zippys i might go to rainbow drive in i havent decided yet
2454805 im going to get some shave ice im going to go body surfing at an undisclosed location
2454806 came as visitors and were only given a visitors permit if they had wanted to settle here permanently they should have applied for a work voucher before they left australia
2454807 my name is solomon i came to work with your team just after you left and ive always wanted to meet you i cant believe this
2454808 the early days were all dire and death these people were the survivors of a six week walk with more than half dying along the way the camp held about 30 000 people and i worked with a team of five or six nurses from the uk we worked alongside tigrinian volunteers some of whom were literate and spoke english as time passed however the daily death toll and despair was slowly replaced by hope and life and the emaciated listless bodies that had confronted me each morning eventually became a gaggle of giggling lads as health and energy returned they used their time to make things from sticks and straw and mimicking me they appeared one morning wearing straw glasses i thought these youngsters terribly funny and so did they just before i finished in safawa everybody picked up sticks and left it was a fantastic phenomenon to see these thousands of people returning in one big group to their homeland healthy and with hope a magnificent sight to behold and a very satisfying end to a long 18 month operation
2454809 i had done a recce in the dry season when all was fine and vibrant and the villages were abuzz with the everyday happenings of sudanese life the rebel groups and the army had since been through though and the fighting and burning of crops and houses had forced the people to flee leaving all completely destroyed and deserted the tank deposited us and our gear at a deserted village but our next lift was unable to meet us while digesting the fact that we now had to walk a string of donkeys happened along under the guidance of some sudanese gold smugglers for want of a better option we commissioned their services and so our books and expensive medical equipment disappeared with the smugglers and their donkeys up a dwindling track as we donned our personal packs and set off on the last leg a seven hour walk and a two hour tractor ride
2454810 your kind invitation to be present at the marriage of gladys may is accepted with very much pleasure by mr r g adams
2454811 i see farming has a future but that we are currently in a lull we are now in a drought cycle as we have been before just not to this extent however i tend to think well come out of it the scene changes all the time and whereas i earnt my money from hay contracting potatoes and sheep there is now a leaning towards cropping unfortunately opportunities at newham with cropping are very limited because of our severe frosts no matter whose hands the farm ends up in there is little doubt they would be able to make a living from it once things improve

2454813 we saw things that are not for printing in this story and ralph together with many others vowed somehow this has got to stop
2454814 ralph disappear the avo come to pick you up in the morning
2454815 it was an extraordinarily cold winters night and we had to go immediately i picked up my little sleeping son from his bed and dressed him then put a piece of bread in my coat pocket together with a professional book important for my husbands work within an hour we had gone out into the cold dark night i couldnt even say goodbye to my beautiful parents i could not dare to think about anything except to get away to safety in austria to save my husbands life and probably my own
2454816 it was almost impossible to appreciate that we were now in a free country it gradually hit me so quickly i had lost my country my loving parents relatives and friends my beloved birthplace budapest and everything that was so dear to me i felt in my heart that they would forever now be just a memory
2454817 it doesnt matter if my head is busy telling me its no good for me or that it will make me gain even more weight in that moment i really dont care ill just open the fridge and wolf down whatever looks good at the time and then of course i just feel fat and sick afterwards its been going on for way too long now i hate the way i look and feel ive really had enough
2454818 we will not release the ousted president at the moment for security reasons we are trying now to establish calm and de escalate the situation
2454819 the former president is fine and in good health he has no problems there is a new authority the states supreme council which will look into the case of the president dossier after putting the countrys internal affairs in order this will take some time
2454820 it is difficult to give a set date for the presidential elections at the moment because we are addressing the priorities of the country and the needs of the people which were long ignored by the former president
2454821 we have foiled a coup attempt that should have been carried out early on thursday by a group of officers lead by rear admiral jose americo bubo na tchute head of the navy
2454822 on wednesday rear admiral na tchute telephoned several superior officers to ask them to join him to overthrow the president the officers contacted the army chief of staff general tagme na waie who ordered his arrest
2454823 they got their freedom back after having been in captivity for a long time the local elders and puntland authorities helped their release

2454941 if they had made substantial proposals in those areas it would have coloured the thinking of unions on the pay side
2454942 workers expect us to lodge claims inflation has not stopped price rises have not stopped
2454943 at the end of the day responsibility will rest with the members they will make the final decisions
2454944 the fact that a major group of employers such as simi was prepared to agree such terms suggests that the ibec agenda in the talks was driven by a hard line minority determined to use adverse economic conditions to put the boot into the most vulnerable sectors of the workforce
2454945 it the agreement also underlines how unrealistic were the terms proposed by ibec last week which involved pay pauses ranging from six to 12 months followed by increases worth 2 5 per cent or nothing at all if employers were feeling pessimistic about the future
2454946 this deal was reported as far back at may 29th there is nothing new in this
2454947 to represent it as a breakthrough in the context of a reversion to local bargaining is misleading
2454948 to represent this as some kind of achievement in the wake of the collapse of the national pay talks is untrue

2454957 but how can you possibly meet up with the expectations that this book had
2454958 it just got so built up there is no book in the world that could stand up to that so i knew it was going to happen but at the same time it hurts
2454959 if they really love the characters then i would hope that this would make sense to them because these are the true characters
2454960 this is the story the way it was always meant to be
2454961 it doesnt always work out that way sometimes you make a decision about what you want and you pay for it and you suffer for it and it doesnt work out those types of stories always leave me horribly depressed im not going to live in a world for a year at a time where thats going to be the ending if people wanted a really depressing tragic ending i gave them a lot of hints that it wasnt going to be that way they really shouldnt have been surprised
2454962 i should have known that people would feel that way
2454963 the name has been real to me for so long now that ive forgotten how unusual it would sound to everyone else
2454964 ive read a lot of books that i didnt like very much and that thought never occurred to me because i had read them i hadnt heard of doing that before thats not fun to hear
2454965 i hope that if they really do enjoy the other books theyll realize that this is kind of where it was supposed to go

2454978 our last album at atlantic kind of left a dissatisfied taste in our mouth on how the major institutions of a record label works
2454979 to get off atlantic and go independent and have full creative control over everything from the artwork to the song selection to production that was the need the need was to show atlantic we can do it and to show our fans that we aint forget and to let them know we can still make great music as the nappy roots

2454985 precipitous decline in the performance of the company and the conscious destruction of its entrepreneurial culture
2454986 when i retired as chairman allianz was a flourishing vibrant and profitable company with a unique culture that challenged motivated recognized and rewarded employees who worked to make themselves and the company better now
2454987 allianz life is a mere shadow of its former self and may be wounded beyond repair
2454988 a full blown bureaucratic management system has been substituted for an entrepreneurial culture bureaucratic managers have infiltrated the company bringing with them the calcifying taint of the bureaucratic culture
2454989 was that we like many companies are being impacted by the economic slowdown and an acute downturn in financial services
2454990 the problems with allianz life cannot be passed off to others
2454991 but must come to roost at the feet of an ineffective destructive bureaucratic management group and in this regard allianz life unfortunately serves as a wonderful case study for comparing the differences between a bureaucratic and entrepreneurial culture

2455065 this is a lot of work and a lot of responsibility since the aircraft flies a lot i can fix anything on this aircraft besides the armament
2455066 i load the hellfire missiles rockets and the 30 mm cannon
2455067 we maintain all the armament communication and avionics this is a complicated aircraft and it always keeps me busy doing this job is very fast paced because we are constantly loading and downloading ammo
2455068 my job is to refuel the apache aircrafts on the flight line
2455069 ive had as many as twelve aircraft at once needing to be refueled during my tours here in iraq each one requires about 350 gallons and they cant fly without fuel flying is how they pilots support the ground troops keeping them in the air is how we support the mission
2455070 this event demonstrates that the iraqi sf and the goi are committed to providing essential services and needed supplies to the local populace

2455081 get your act together tvnz you have screwed up a golden opportunity to show live coverage at 10 30am on saturday morning when all the pony club kids could have watched it live
2455082 in the past people have only had the option of tv one on analogue coverage and it is pretty comprehensive we are running from 12 midday to 2 oclock in the morning so its not as if you cant find all the best bits on tv one
2455083 but if for instance you have a particular interest in a minority sport you can chase it through the tvnz co nz website because they have a schedule of every event that is related to that sport and in many cases there will be coverage on one of the online channels
2455084 so youve got a much better chance of seeing live action in your preferred sport than you would in the past
2455085 oh theres the nzers and now we go to break
2455086 to say with freeview or computer access you can get a clearer picture of what is happening is arrogance
2455087 on the u s persons side its 100 or less
2455088 theres a sense that were doing massive data mining in fact what were doing is surgical
2455089 a telephone number is surgical so if you know what number you can select it out
2455090 no one spends other peoples money as carefully as he spends his own
2455091 we have broken the chains of the old exploitative capitalist system
2455092 the state now has the obligation to build the model of a socialist economy
2455093 at 1216 hours craig tapped his right foot i recognized this as a signal used by persons wishing to engage in lewd conduct craig tapped his toes several times and moves his foot closer to my foot i moved my foot up and down slowly while this was occurring the male in the stall to my right was still present i could hear several unknown persons in the restroom that appeared to use the restroom for its intended use the presence of others did not seem to deter craig as he moved his right foot so that it touched the side of my left foot which was within my stall area
2455094 i could see craig had a gold ring on his ring finger as his hand was on my side of the stall divider
2455095 with my left hand near the floor i pointed towards the exit craig responded no i again pointed towards the exit craig exited the stall with his roller bags without flushing the toilet craig said he would not go i told craig that he was under arrest he had to go and that i didnt want to make a scene craig then left the restroom
2455096 it is everything that i wanted last year i had a difficult time when i came here injured and i had to work hard to get into the team
2455097 i did that and i think all the work i did last year has helped me get this new three year contract so i am so happy
2455098 i felt settled last year and that is why my number one choice was always west bromwich
2455099 last season was great for everybody and i wanted to stay
2455100 i wasnt that i wanted to leave i just waited and hoped that west bromwich would come and show me some appreciation which they did
2455101 i am just so happy i can stay here with this team i just hope i can be as good this season
2455102 i think i am ready we have done a lot of running so i think i am fitter now
2455103 i would have liked some work over the ball in the last week but the running has gone well so i feel great
2455104 i think this is a step or two up in quality fitness and speed
2455105 everybody would rather have done more with the balls and i less running but i think we needed it and hopefully we will be better for it
2455106 everyone is nervous rather than fearful last season we were under pressure all the time as we wanted to get promotion but now the atmosphere has changed we cant wait for the new season to start
2455107 we believe there is a possibility of a real economic downturn here and further continued difficulties in the credit market
2455108 if you look at the consensus forecasts theres a strong possibility of further declines in uk house prices and this type of scenario needs to be built into firms business models
2455109 when we come through that history tells us thats not something thats going to play through in months its going to be well through the year end
2455110 wed expect people to plan on that type of assumption and weve been working with individual institutions to ensure we are comfortable with their longer term plans
2455111 we deem the longer term plan to be that sort of time horizon
2455112 if people want to dampen down these cycles and to ensure banks are less likely to violently react in a downturn to some degree they will have to accept there will be less on the upturn as well
2455113 the iranian suspicions of us were only natural in the post revolutionary situation but that after a transition period common interests could provide a basis for future cooperation not on the scale of before but sufficient to demonstrate that iran has not been lost to us and to the west
2455114 i havent seen the writers room as energized in a while not that we werent really passionate about it before but i think its just forced everyone to think deeper
2455115 so theres some sense of leaving the past behind and moving to the next part of the superman mythology
2455116 the trouble is they are now facing an attempted murder charge
2455117 the primary means we have of encouraging positive change in cuba today is to help the cuban people become less dependent on the castro regime in fundamental ways
2455118 until it is clear what type of policies might come with a new government we cannot talk about changes in the u s policies toward cuba
2455119 were in a very critical moment where many of us are hoping that we will see a transition as opposed to a transfer of power frankly i think his comments are ill timed
2455120 it shows that he either didnt think it through very well or simply hasnt had enough experience on these tough foreign policy problems

2455123 how are g unit records doing in these times of file sharing
2455124 the advances in technology impacts everyone and we all must adapt most of all hip hop a style of music dependent upon a youthful audience this market consists of individuals embracing innovations faster than the fans of classical and jazz music
2455125 what is important for the music industry to understand is that this really doesnt hurt the artists
2455126 the concerts are crowded and the industry must understand that they have to manage all the 360 degrees around an artist they the industry have to maximize their income from concerts and merchandise it is the only way they can get their marketing money back
2455127 the main problem is that the artists are not getting as much help developing as before file sharing they are now learning to peddle ringtones not records
2455128 apa yang penting untuk industri musik mengerti bahwa ini sungguh tidak melukai artis
2455129 bagaimana tindakan dan sikap g unit record terhadap file sharing yang semakin semarak belakangan ini
2455130 kemajuan dalam teknologi mempengaruhi semuanya dan kita semua harus beradaptasi
2455131 apa yang penting untuk industri musik mengerti bahwa ini sungguh tidak melukai artis
2455132 konser dan industri harus mengerti bahwa mereka harus mengatur semua 360 derajat disekeliling artis
2455133 masalah utama adalah bahwa artis tidak banyak membantu perkembangannya dibandingkan sebelum file sharing mereka sekarang belajar menjajakan dagangan nada dering tidak records
2455134 this sounds like a particularly confising william gibson novel can someone condense

2455142 he wants his magazine to be the new rolling stone
2455143 it is a curious habit of ours to wait for the future when it has happened already
2455144 my personal hypothesis is that our consciousness is co creating reality therefore we want to be increasingly careful about the kind of thoughts we are allowing to absorb our awareness
2455145 to write the legendary crazy screeds stitching the whole awful global web of parapolitics together
2455146 paranoia seems to us an absolute patriotic duty at the moment and rigorous intuition is like the incredibly symbolically twisted and bizarre dream you wake up from to realize that the scenario thrown up from the unconscious is actually the expression of some very simple truth you had been desperate to avoid facing
2455147 i dont know how i could begin assessing from here tonight the merits of duncans story and the legitimacy of the verdict of suicide i do know it would be indecent to try
2455148 but both harassment and the delusion of harassment are real and a paranoid screed can also be ones patriotic duty murders and suicides happen all the time as do murders that mimic suicide and less frequently the reverse lt gt lt gt lt gt lt gt advocating for justice and truth and a closure to mystery does not mean forever contending that death must come by another hand and sometimes we ought to be adamant that we simply dont know
2455149 what a world that provides people with choices like this and then murders them when they make the wrong one
2455150 it goes on and on and it seems that only strong continuing resistance will suffice
2455151 it is as if the air hates beauty creativity spirit all you read these days in the news in comments online and all you hear in friends conversations in hate
2455152 i was first introduced to the pair on march 21 2000 at the opening reception of the whitney biennial their video collaboration the history of glamour combined the codes of fiction with reality fashion with art and animation with mtv
2455153 what happens when you cross the wrong ultraconservative rich powerful people
2455154 here i am quoting a dead womans blog to prove my point that paranoia is not a mental illness paranoia keeps you alive it lets you see the awful truth that the sheep cant see the price is heavy but its not a curse
2455155 paranoia seems to us an absolute patriotic duty at the moment
2455156 i appreciate the fact that the death was strange but as bad as it sounds there have been stranger suicide is very complex and is the result of someone rationalizing unrational behavior because they believe there is no answer theresa was a self centered insecure and grasping woman she clung desperately to blakes small fame to validate herself her last pathetic act was to try and capture the imagination and glamor that was always just out of reach rip theresa
2455157 her site is now gone but the text is available in googles cache
2455158 you sure it wasnt the transformer explosion on mission that knocked out power to around 30 000
2455159 i worked with theresa some years ago and while i adored her partner monica gesue theresa never really seemed content or approachable sad tidings and my best wishes to all the survivors
2455160 again i cant confirm that this is how it all went down no mainstream outlet has yet reported on either duncans death or blakes disappearance but if it turns out to be true man what a sad story fans of punch drunk love will know blakes work he designed the films psychedelic transitions
2455161 theresa duncan a game designer who went on to make films committed suicide last week
2455162 chop suey wasnt just a kids game it was new and different magical and hip a game from duncans magnet interactive that is now considered a classic and dont tell me that kids games cant be classic games unless youve played chop suey duncan left behind a long term partner who was last seen entering the surf and hasnt been heard from since a shame
2455163 suicide of controversial arts blogger theresa duncan vital part of the story missing
2455164 there are a growing number of blogs facebook and myspace pages belonging to people whove died
2455165 often families and friends dont take down the pages leaving them online as a personal memorial with farewell messages from loved ones filling the comments
2455166 people are posting anonymously because the art world is a small community and this is a sensitive topic
2455167 i dont know if this is coordinated but its extremely suspicious in my mind
2455168 so lets all try and live clever and witty lives in her honor shall we
2455169 its been 3 days since i learned and its still impossible to believe it
2455170 but the story is convoluted chilling and bizarre thoughtintersect is definitely not a source of news breaking or broken
2455171 this sort of strange mystery seems like a work of art in its own way im not saying that it was staged as such but the different layers of meaning in the events as well as the ambiguity of some information makes it quite compelling
2455172 perhaps aptly what has been made public of her death and blakes disappearance is shaping up as a modern blogosophere noir
2455173 the apparent double suicide of jeremy blake and theresa duncan friends cite strange behavior in the final days of a golden couple in the art world
2455174 they would say they are following us harassing our landlord
2455175 but it got to be something that was huge to them a youre either with us or against us thing where if you didnt believe them you werent on their side the story they had woven in paranoia and conspiracies took over part of their lives a lot of us couldnt understand that acting out
2455176 the couple had moved in february from los angeles back to new york where blake had accepted a job as an in house graphic designer forvideo game manufacturer rockstar games
2455177 looked like a rock star he wore sunglasses indoors sometimes he sipped whiskey at work
2455178 a need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species homo sapiens second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter
2455179 his works werent film and they werent paintings it wasnt computer art it wasnt animation and though it was painterly fine art it was a hybrid of many things in the future i think hell be considered a first explorer in a new territory of art making
2455180 i dont think anyone can interpret what happened its a great loss it tends to happen in the art world more than other areas its tragic they were brilliant complex people i think everyone is shocked
2455181 i solicited her for a response to thomas pynchons novel against the day and her response was very smart yet felt extremely personal her blog was full of that kind of writing oddly moving prose on a wide range of subjects
2455182 i dont know how glamorous she was she was pretty she was sexy
2455183 she did put a lot of herself on her blog
2455184 theresa duncan announced that she was working on an essay called
2455185 used to be a thing going round about all of the dead bodies that bill clinton left in his wake
2455186 i am not going down that rabbit hole no way am i going to follow theresa
2455187 i didnt realize how much you guys love me now i know i get it
2455188 i trawl conspiracy theory websites to scare and entertain myself and only half believe what i read there
2455189 as mere political ravings overlooks the vast majority of the sites actual content short observations often limited to single quotations and photographs with an articulate precision and interpretive confidence other writers would only dream of achieving she could be writing about supermodels the occult music 9 11 percy bysshe shelley perfume los angeles or the films of quentin tarantino

2455191 the brainy moneyed people who occupy the intersection of art and technology
2455192 rosenbaum might not get anywhere with this the story might just remain what it is now an incoherent mystery an obsession that slams against the walls of privacy until it slinks away thwarted but whatever rosenbaum finds he wont stretch it to reflect his own biases and impulses as i believe the times reporter did his writing clearly delineates facts from speculation and all imaginative leaps are clearly marked so we can enjoy them
2455193 i had just returned from a few days away from home milwaukee wi and was so saddened to learn not just of theresas unfortunate demise but also that i could easily have attended the services in lapeer mi as i was just a few miles away in flint as they happened had i only known for all of her skills and insights it is theresas friendly and kind manner which i shall miss most and of course her wit polished to a fine sheen as it was
2455194 i had visited ms duncans blog on a more than daily basis as she always had yet another thing to say later in the day i love to read the writings of intelligent humourous and loudmouth women she was that and they are often hard to find it feels so strange to feel so heartbroken at the passing of someone ive only ever encountered online she always generously returned any email i sent whether it be about who invented which scent for chanel or how cool is this minaiture sic recreation of freuds office
2455195 the weirder tributaries and backwaters for those of you who dare to look

2455198 what a melancholy death is that of mr poe a man so richly endowed with genius i never knew him personally but have always entertained a high appreciation of his powers as a prose writer and a poet his prose is remarkably vigorous direct and yet affluent and his verse has a particular charm of melody and atmosphere of true peotry about is which is very winning the harshness of his criticisms i have never attributed to anything but the irritation of a sensitive nature charged by some indefinite sense of wrong
2455199 you and me are the only three people whove ever read this book
2455200 he poe spoke with a slight southern drawl hence he rhymed sister and vista hanted and enchanted poe did not drop the final letter of words like hunting
2455201 it is often difficult to tell when poe is being serious and when he is playing the reader is also never sure when poe is presenting fact or fiction
2455202 the right to despise a world which galled his self conceit
2455203 the weird splendors of his imagination compelling men to read and to accredit as possible truths his most marvellous conceptions

2455218 linux companies like ourselves need to work closely with people making the next wave of appliance or netbooks we need to seize it before other people fill the gap
2455219 the business model of microsoft will adjust down to netbooks and appliances
2455220 we can do it but its a really small window of time the pc world is moving on
2455221 we have been trying to resize and use open source to appeal to consumers but to be honest its tough
2455222 from a general operating system perspective theres still a lot of packages to download thats not something you are going to see my mom use
2455223 until it gets to the point where its drop dead simple or devices lock down functionality you arent going to see much uptake among consumers
2455224 one of my biggest concerns has been injuries how that could just dash away all kinds of planning and of course to have a player go down like dwyane wade one of the real premier players in the world that raised some real questions hes been really injured for two years
2455225 i saw a couple of explosive things but he wasnt back yet
2455226 he was really refocused on coming back and proving to people that he could
2455227 because some people doubted that and i suggested to him he create a little bit of an edge
2455228 and i didnt have to sell myself he just saw that i had the eye of the tiger and i was ready to go
2455229 there was no doubt in my mind he would be ready
2455230 so before we even got here i already knew he was gonna be ready he promised me that he was gonna be ready so what hes doing now is not a surprise to me
2455231 i dont think he would come out this summer if he wasnt healthy
2455232 and if hes healthy we know what kind of basketball hes capable of playing so we expected that before we even started
2455233 the way hes getting to the basket right now is unbelievable theres nobody right now that can stay in front of him

2455301 portsmouth are very difficult to beat with their physical strength and mixed in with that they have some hugely skilful players
2455302 a grand experiment that could dramatically alter the way we use and look at the streets of new york
2455303 streets that are normally tied up with cars and trucks will be turned over to the public so that we can experience this city as never before

2455308 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup last season

2455310 the community shield is a prestigious match but i have used players in it who were not quite fit and we are more or less in the same situation again
2455311 they had a great season last year and now harry redknapp has brought crouch into the squad the partnership of crouch and defoe will be a handful for anyone now but hopefully we can cope with that

2455321 spiritual fulfillment they get from practicing their religion on the mountain the land on which the ski resort is located is owned by the federal government
2455322 a government action which decreases the spirituality the fervor or the satisfaction with which a believer practices his religion is not what congress has labeled a substantial burden a term of art chosen by congress to be defined by reference to supreme court precedent on the free exercise of religion he said
2455323 triumphs that voters should consider in his bid for congress in the district 1 race
2455324 least restrictive means of interfering with any religious practice when considering projects built on federal land
2455325 the court is being the arbiter of religious beliefs which is not its role he said
2455326 the court is supposed to determine whether the religious beliefs at issue are sincerely held and thats it shanker said
2455327 once theyve made that determination its not for the court to decide whether or not they agree with the testimony that was presented

2455346 whispered in musharrafs ear that it is time to leave
2455347 over the next few days they will make it clear to him musharraf that a protracted battle against impeachment is not in pakistans interests
2455348 the army is neutral but is expecting him to resign it will then influence his honourable safe passage as the armys senior leadership would not want him to be punished
2455349 washington was still hoping that the ppp would work with musharraf but he was not working with us
2455350 america wants pakistan to be effectively governed and so has realised that the domestic struggle has to be resolved
2455351 i have no knowledge of that but pakistan would be better served by a civilian president with a knowledge of democracy

2455365 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2455366 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2455367 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2455368 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2455369 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2455379 if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant
2455380 far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
2455381 examples of sexual flexibility dont square with genetic theories of rigid erotic predestination

2455385 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
2455386 future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period if found to be effective such interventions may prevent the devastating impact associated with postpartum suicide attempt

2455513 the writhings of worldwide anglicanism are another reason to disestablish the church of england
2455514 anglicanism works through relationships a sense of belonging to a family with a shared inheritance that now has waned despite the apparent reprieve this years lambeth conference could well be the last of its kind
2455515 the thorny issues facing the church were artfully concealed by euphemism and arcane procedures that will unfold over several years
2455516 the feast of the transfiguration is a wonderful excuse to celebrate transformed life
2455517 the direct pastoral contact the responsibility for sunday worship and the creativity of a regular teaching programme
2455518 not because of what the world says but because it is inherent in our faith
2455519 if we are going to make significant progress internationally it will have to come from some moral persuasion the arguments of economics and politics will not deliver this is not something that is being heavily driven by any government in the world
2455520 we need to maximise the choices that are available now and the price we will pay if we dont is so much greater
2455521 this is something that is inherent in our faith if we are going to make significant progress internationally it will have to come from some moral persuasion the arguments of economics and politics will not deliver this is not something that is being heavily driven by any government in the world
2455522 we spoke in the bible studies today of creation as the body of god all creation reflects the image of god not just human beings were gathered here to remind people that if we do not pay attention to all creation the other things that concern us will be of no importance
2455523 lets use the world up so that jesus will come back soon
2455524 why is it that the church cannot take this message to the pulpit
2455525 if we blow the right trumpet many will join us let us use our credibility to give credibility to the mission of jesus who came to the world that we may have fullness of life
2455526 in other words we have messed up the environment in such a way that even the production of cashew nuts is unpredictable
2455527 we wish this phenomenon would leave our cashew nuts alone
2455528 tonight as we wash for perhaps the third or fourth time minimum for the second time there are people who are queuing up tonight to see whether they can be the first ones to collect 20 liters of water to carry to their whole family
2455529 the solution will not be found through politics or economics alone
2455530 because he like almost all western leaders believe that western self interest will always prevail and that we will not be prepared to actually do what is required to meet this challenge
2455531 put our own house in order we need to put our institutional house in order
2455532 the poor of mozambique pay the bills of the rich in australia and that is immoral
2455533 for a lot of foreigners the only image of china comes from old movies that make us look poor and pathetic

2455539 heute ist f r uns ein traum wahr geworden aber leider haben uns die beiden brasilianer keine chance gelassen
2455540 beachvolleyball ist f r die menschen in brasilien einfach wahnsinnig wichtig daher bekommen wir von unseren landsleuten zu hause auch die unterst tzung die wir f r unser spiel brauchen
2455541 wir sind beide hoch konzentriert und felsenfest von unseren qualit ten berzeugt ich denke wir k nnen hier jedes spiel gewinnen

2455543 alcohol has definitely played a factor with many of those arrested with incidents ranging from low level disorder assaults and public order offences like swearing and abusive behaviour
2455544 we will use all the tools at our disposal to rid the railway system of football troublemakers
2455545 we know that these people are in the minority but we dont want them spoiling things for the majority of law abiding football fans
2455546 every year 1000 people who worked in building maintenance and repair trades die from past exposures to asbestos fibres
2455547 asbestos must be properly managed to prevent people dying from asbestos diseases in the future if you are responsible for managing the maintenance and repair of a building you must manage any asbestos in it hse has provided guidance to help people understand what they have to do to comply with their legal obligations
2455548 it shall be the duty of every employer to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable the health safety and welfare at work of all his employees
2455549 a suitable and sufficient plan of work must be prepared and followed
2455550 employees must reduce the spread of asbestos so far as is reasonably practicable
2455551 suitable and sufficient steps must be taken to prevent the risk from fire
2455552 im fiercely independent and am able to live on my own and get about
2455553 my husband robert died 12 years ago and my son ciaron helps me a lot
2455554 i left school at 15 and had done nothing since that art wise i went to a mainstream school but when your sight is like mine art isnt something you are inclined to do
2455555 if it hadnt been for pep id never have done this
2455556 the tutors at pep are a great help to me when im doing it
2455557 she really is one of the rising stars in pep
2455558 we provide many services and anns achievements show what can be done by anyone and the help is there for them
2455559 we try to encourage people to learn new things and ann is now going on to college which is fantastic for her and the project she showed an interest in art when she first came and we helped her realise that
2455560 the bond between her and her brother is just amazing weve always told bethanie what a special boy he is and what he has done for her theyre like two peas in a pod and i have never seen her look so healthy
2455561 she has even been able to go on rides at a funfair which shes never been able to do before that was so nice to see
2455562 theres a whole new world out there for her now and thats all because of joshua
2455563 shes still not able to stand the doctors are looking into that but we stand joshua in front of her as motivation because she wants to teach him to walk
2455564 in many ways he is like her big brother a mini version
2455565 i didnt really think it would work i always had doubts when it did work it took a few days to sink in
2455566 there was the possibility of a lot of side effects afterwards but bethanie has breezed through it shes really done well
2455567 he is a lovely little boy all the nurses love him and give him lots of hugs
2455568 there is no five star world class hotel resort near the capital of the standard of gleneagles or loch lomond
2455569 this hotel is just 20 minutes away from edinburgh and it will be a huge boost to the capital
2455570 manor kingdom estates is now liaising with local community representatives and scottish borders council and hopes to be able to start work in late 2008
2455571 this is an exciting development for both edinburgh and the scottish borders it gives visitors the opportunity to stay in a five star rural location only a short distance from edinburgh
2455572 the city active experience is key for increasing tourism and incorporates elements of both a city break and the great outdoors this new hotel development creates the ideal base for such a break
2455573 the new hotel will give an extra dimension to the accommodation offering in edinburgh and also the scottish borders
2455574 we are really enthusiastic about acquiring a site in the south east of scotland to compliment what weve already delivered in the west of scotland through cameron house at loch lomond
2455575 ultimately our vision is that the hotel will act as a catalyst to improving the existing rutherford castle golf course to championship standard and ultimately attracting a pga event to the area
2455576 i believe everything happens for a reason when i left tv i was like get away from it all but now im thinking why the hell not if somebody would consider me i wouldnt chuck it away
2455577 i first heard about tibet when i was at edinburgh university some of my friends formed a group and i went along to a film screening and a couple of talks
2455578 as i learned more i got more and more involved i felt that my skills as a climber could be used to help
2455579 i practiced climbing up trees at corstorphine hill i spent quite a bit of time up there
2455580 i am over the moon by the support i have got from scotland my actions are a small part of a much larger campaign but i hope that a small difference has been made
2455581 i didnt go there to get arrested but i did realise the risks
2455582 i went to beijing to shine a spotlight on the way the chinese have tried to whitewash the human rights abuses in tibet
2455583 there is still a lot of work to be done but we have a good feeling about this
2455584 there is a huge pattern of car usage around the city bypass just now because a lot of these people have no public transport alternative unless they go into the city and out again
2455585 if we make the service fast reliable and comfortable then we can win these people over
2455586 the good thing is we can start with the major pinch points and gradually build the network from there
2455587 on the face of it this seems like a very good idea particularly if you are linking together all the known hotspots that people want to travel and also linking into the tram and park and rides
2455588 giving buses their own dedicated lanes will mean you are getting realistic journey times and that means genuine choice for motorists
2455589 the start time is not only early for us but for italy too there is a different mentality with russian teams regarding early matches as they tend to have an issue with fatigue
2455590 i have to persuade them and work hard to overcome this mentality and be prepared for tough matches but it seems that i fought here alone its an issue of attitude
2455591 there was also a lack of concentration from the players italy took advantage of this in the third and fourth sets
2455592 recently we played three warm up matches against poland and afterwards all the players complained they were tired fatigue is a big issue which we must resolve
2455593 im very proud of my players we play a good match with a good rhythm
2455594 we learnt a lot from the world grand prix we play we win and we lose and we are getting used to the ups and downs and all the changes
2455595 the bus was coming from durban and the other 65 passengers were not injured the bus driver had his leg amputated
2455596 we have foiled a coup attempt that should have been carried out early thursday by a group of officers lead by rear admiral jose americo bubo na tchute head of the navy
2455597 on wednesday rear admiral na tchute telephoned several superior officers to ask them to join him to overthrow the president the officers contacted the army chief of staff general tagme na waie who ordered his arrest
2455598 i dont feel real lucky i am glad i got in with a 68
2455599 i saw the pin on 13 and i knew 12 and 13 would be birdie holes
2455600 i hit some good shots on those holes and made birdie
2455601 after my third birdie the next four holes were into the wind and i was just trying to make par on those holes
2455602 alirezaei swims in lane one and the representative of the zionist regime israel in lane seven so they will not face each other
2455603 the shirt with the five stars is a source of pride for both the players and the brazilian people and we would like to keep wearing it but if it affects brazils bid for 2016 we have to understand and accept it
2455604 by 2010 we will be very close to series production and aim to start with limited numbers in the hundreds
2455605 our aim is to cover costs by 2010 by 2012 we would be producing around 10 000 units
2455606 the next phase in electric car production is equipping the smart micro cars with lithium ion batteries with smart two seaters and the mercedes a series coming onto the market the following year
2455607 berlin is very interested and paris and rome would also be possible
2455608 twenty taliban were killed and 14 others were wounded in both ground and air raids
2455609 insurgents attacked the soldiers and surrounding civilian areas with small arms and heavy machine guns
2455610 his great experience in recruiting militants meant he was the leader of the group
2455611 it is still raining heavily and we fear that the number of people killed will continue to grow
2455612 the water level of the red river is also rising rapidly
2455613 when they heard the noise both ran for the door but the mother was not quick enough to escape being buried
2455614 her son was lucky to escape with minor scratches but he lost his mother
2455615 it is like a dream come true it is a new beginning
2455616 it is not easy but that is the olympic games
2455617 this is a dream come true having dreamt of going to the olympics since i was six years old
2455618 there is such an amazing vibe in the village it is amazing to see how organized the olympics are the plants the architecture everybody is overwhelmed and excited
2455619 for the first time in 5 000 years the olympics has turned beijing into the centre of the universe
2455620 we plant trees we sow seeds the land turns green
2455621 a throwback to communist era 1980s in a live broadcast
2455622 perfect harmony peace smiling faces marching masses flags bigwigs waving from stands watching the olympic games opening ceremony somehow took the viewers several years back wait didnt the spartakiada look like this
2455623 more to the point it was a counter image of what china often stands for in the west not an ominous economic power but a nation with an ancient culture fascinating sounds and traditional images
2455624 not for decades has an olympic games been opened in such a colourful and overpowering fashion
2455625 the perfect show also demonstrated chinas frantic desire for recognition and contained a lot of propaganda
2455626 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
2455627 a breathtaking culmination of seven years of planning and preparation the world will remember this for a long time
2455628 heaven knows what it was like to watch this if you were one of the people charged with designing the follow up for london in 2012
2455629 es una batalla que ganaremos porque defendemos una cosa justa que es ley

2455631 our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2455632 im going to sign a decree to introduce martial law in georgia and present it to parliament for approval
2455633 tactical groups have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2455634 the chandlery sector which provides food cleaning material and technical assistance to the vessels circulating in the turkish territorial waters has an exportation potential of 500 million dollars
2455635 das hat mich genervt ohne ende und nervt mich heute noch

2455640 find something youre passionate about and keep tremendously interested in it
2455641 i am really excited by the prospect of staging this race again which will bring the concept of the nine hour race back to life in a most dramatic fashion ever since 2002 it has been an ambition of mine to see racing of this sort return to goodwood the cars will look magnificent racing against the backdrop of an autumnal west sussex sunset maybe with the odd star twinkling above
2455642 about 32 of the owners of 1 49 units would not buy the same property again if given a second chance about 50 of the owners of 1 49 units spent 1 8 hours every week on maintenance or management about 20 spent more than 8 hours per week on maintenance or management
2455643 the state should promote vessel construction and companies should not wait in queues for such constructions
2455644 the chandlery sector which provides food cleaning material and technical assistance to the vessels circulating in the turkish territorial waters has an exportation potential of 500 million dollars
2455645 i imagine there are far fewer buyers in that market though youd be limited to mexican citizens with high paying jobs which lets face it and foreigners looking to relocate to the area
2455646 no my vacuum broke and i start for 22 hour at the steel plant on monday so i really dont care

2455655 we have three options now first it may be played on sunday as scheduled either at the gachibowli stadium or lal bahadur stadium the second option is to shift the venue to another city and play within a week the last option is to postpone the game for a month or two a decision will be taken by the committee at 1600 hrs
2455656 the ground at gachibowli was unplayable and with the kind of rain here it will be worse on sunday the match then will not be decided by football skills it will be a shame if a final match of such an important tournament is decided by factors not connected to football
2455657 lal bahadur stadium was no better than gachibowli it will be an embarrassment for the afc and aiff if the final is played at lbs which is a cricket ground

2455686 and as time wore on and we created our own mythology for the show any historical work that i did was thrown out the window because we were rewriting history for our own purposes

2455690 in a really good working situation you come in you know the words and the scene unfolds for itself it happens with what you know what you know about the situation and whats going on between the characters for instance when i was working on farscape i would come in and i would just wait to see what claudia black did and play off of that

2455703 cbsnews com a number of evangelicals and leaders of what used to be called the religious right have said that what theyre really looking for to determine whether they hold they nose when they vote for mccain or whether they go in enthusiastically and bring their friends is the person he chooses to be his running mate what are you and the people you represent looking for in that running mate richard land first of all i agree with that assessment i think that the vice presidential choice that john mccain makes is probably the most important choice hes going to make in this entire campaign because he has no room for error no margin for doubt if he picks a pro choice running mate it will confirm the unease and the mistrust that some evangelicals and dont forget this social conservative catholics feel about mccain if he picks a pro life running mate it will help to ease their concerns and confirm to them that while he may not have been their first choice he may not have been their second choice that its better to vote for a third class fireman than it is to allow a first class arsonist to become president

2455712 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2455713 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2455714 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2455715 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2455716 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2455717 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2455718 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2455719 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2455726 it was important for bob and rick that they stay involved in the business that their team stays together and that they have an opportunity to grow the business
2455727 that is why we have made the decision to maintain the saxon brand as a sub brand of mackenzie and to market their multicap value style
2455728 the acquisitions have to strategically fit the general business direction and have to make sense financially
2455729 most importantly we have to like the people because this business is all about people

2455745 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2455746 india whose nuclear cooperation with the u s is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2455747 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2455748 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery

2455755 this woman had a seemingly incurable condition causing her to bleed constantly this may have been a menstrual or uterine disorder that would have made her ritually unclean leviticus 15 25 27 amp would have excluded her from most social contact
2455756 she desperately wanted jesus to heal her but she knew that her bleeding would cause jesus to be unclean under jewish law if she touched him
2455757 sometimes we feel that our problems will keep us from god but he is always ready to help we should never allow our fear to keep us from approaching him
2455758 a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle

2455764 english version here ive been invited to write a guest post on his blog and im hoping he will do the same for me well let you know when that happens
2455765 things have calmed down with a lot of the events
2455766 i always was afraid i would lose a part of my identity when i left the job
2455767 im just going to add to it with all the new things ill be doing
2455768 hes the type of man who will not tell you he is going to do something and not do it
2455769 as a boss hes very flexible very forgiving he would never tell me to do something that he wouldnt do himself if im stuffing a bunch of envelopes hell come right in and stuff them with me ask me how my day is
2455770 i still feel i have some productive years ahead of me
2455771 this is our first talent show but we auditioned at the clackamas county fair
2455772 this is definitely less intimidating than the classic competitions weve done before
2455773 you know you are in a great show and that is something you can tell everyone
2455774 its like a stampede in here then it slows way down then another wave comes through
2455775 often there are people who think its cool to get something like this but they have no business doing so
2455776 not the rearview mirror because theres nothing we can change in those two ballgames
2455777 in some respects players here are more enjoyable to work with than the most talented and gifted players in the game these guys all want to get there and they want to do the work
2455778 you can see how much he loves the game teaching it to us
2455779 equal amounts optimism cynicism humor and sarcasm all in equal doses it keeps you sane

2455781 im just thankful to have this length of a career and the number of years i got in the big leagues
2455782 theres so many different ways to get the most out of guys
2455783 treb does a good job hes got the track record and when you have a track record and you respect everyone like he does they want to perform for you
2455784 theyve always been a pretty respectful team no ones punched anyone out nothing violent
2455785 we always wave and smile at each other you couldnt tell that were rivals
2455786 the ages of the gymnasts are provided by their provinces and cities
2455787 the focus is on their training and how to improve their performances not on that kind of question
2455788 were ready to face anything over age or under age
2455789 for everybody you just have to play your own game and perform your routines
2455790 there was no booing no nonsense that was going on within the crowd
2455791 we have arrested the prime accused in the murders police are closing in on a few more suspects who were part of the gang the murders were purely for gain and there was no other motive
2455792 none of your business why must you meddle with your friends problems
2455793 the execution went well and the doctors declared ten minutes later that rio was dead
2455794 required to obtain a fresh vote of confidence from the parliament
2455795 otherwise the parliament being a sovereign and independent body has the option to exercise the right to impeach him
2455796 should prolong his stay in office against the wishes of the people
2455797 the act of showering bullets and lathis on innocent people in jammu is due to the faulty policies of the union government

2455799 heat waves have become more frequent over most land areas the frequency of heavy precipitation events has also increased over most land areas
2455800 it is institutions like iit delhi that will have to show the way not only in terms of influencing society and its decisions through a rigorous interpretation of scientific and technological phenomena being experienced in the world but by also creating technological solutions that go far beyond what is available today
2455801 there was no evidence of assault by police on bhaskar
2455802 i dont want to join the government but workers of samajwadi party think we well benefit if i join the government
2455803 accept the leadership of the congress under soniaji and the administrative leadership of manmohan singh whether i remain inside or outside the cabinet
2455804 i cannot duplicate the style of the left in supporting the government
2455805 i am not keen i am not dying for it but i am not disinterested either
2455806 the local congress up pradesh congress committee is interested for a pre poll alliance
2455807 we would like to call upon the state government to resolve the farmers problem by holding an unconditional discussion involving government peasants representatives and the industry meaning the tatas immediately
2455808 we are ready to to meet union home minister shivraj patil individually as we have put forth our view point before the centre
2455809 we will not talk to them as they are responsible for all this issue
2455810 we will boycott the delegation as mehbooba farooq and saifuddin soz are part of the team they are responsible for the amarnath land issue
2455811 gt pittsford native ward stare conducts at the aspen music festival in 2007 the 25 year old was appointed resident conductor of the st louis symphony orchestra on may 29
2455812 wards exceptional talent and passion for music will doubtless inspire our youth orchestra and audiences here in st louis
2455813 we are very much looking forward to having him here
2455814 i had the time and the resources and i was lucky enough to have connections through my studies and career to that point to really go after conducting
2455815 i always wanted to conduct before i became an accomplished trombone player
2455816 it was sort of like an extreme a la carte education
2455817 the second year i flew all over europe to take master classes and get on the podium with different orchestras in moscow paris finland germany london and the french alps
2455818 david robertson is the music director and i have tremendous respect for him and the orchestra is a fine orchestra they are at a place in their history where they are really growing and im excited to be a part of it
2455819 it the show is a way for me to celebrate her memory
2455820 she vasile was like a second mother to everyone in my neighborhood
2455821 i thought it might have been oxidation due to rust
2455822 i most certainly did not become a police officer to write speeding tickets but it is part of our job to keep them the public safe
2455823 you have the best view into the vehicle and youre protected from the door swinging out
2455824 itd be ideal if we didnt have to write any tickets at all
2455825 our whole goal is voluntary compliance we want drivers to think about it
2455826 have you ever seen gilmore girls they live in this really small town a homey one thats kind of what i was expecting but this was even more rural it was a very small and very spread out place theres only one intersection in town
2455827 we actually stayed in the cullen house its technically not i dont think stephenie meyer ever went to the town till after the book came out but for the most part it looked like it the essence
2455828 the house that bella lived in the designated houses kitchen actually has yellow cupboards in the kitchen which bellas house had we didnt get to go inside its someones house but thats what the innkeeper told us
2455829 we went to bellas house the hospital carlisle cullen works at and the forks outfitters where bella works
2455830 and its really beautiful and its where they fought victoria and all the newborns vampires
2455831 i think la push and the rain forest were my favorite its so beautiful there are islands that stick up out of the water really really pretty
2455832 she liked to tell stories it was probably better than the van tours definitely
2455833 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2455834 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2455835 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2455836 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2455837 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2455838 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2455839 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2455840 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2455841 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2455842 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2455843 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2455844 yes i had a tom mann worm and a flasher the kids of today dont realize how good they have it what with all of the products lines gpss rods and reels plus thousands of lures to choose from
2455845 i like to use the computer and i want to be a scientist when i grow up
2455846 theres a student whos very talkative one who is quiet and reserved and others whose eyes light up when they learn something new
2455847 digging was fun and i got to wear safety glasses
2455848 i had fun learning about the weather and pretending i was on tv it was cool
2455849 in the safe environment of our classroom students learn to understand american english
2455850 we practice speaking about daily life and academic subjects often using this as a time to compare cultures and explain american customs its very rewarding at the end of the day to see a student come out of their shell at a place like the museum and be able to have fun while learning
2455851 preseason is really important to me like all these guys
2455852 were working hard and this is where you get better
2455853 we will just have to keep working on all the areas that we have identified that need improvement a lot of guys got playing time some guys got quite a bit
2455854 i dont think it is very different than the other positions
2455855 sometimes the player doesnt have the opportunity to be productive on a particular play whether that is because of what the other team is doing or maybe because of another breakdown
2455856 then there are other times when he does in the end the bottom line is how do you feel the players production on any given play is rated toward the potential or what he could have done or he should have been able to do in that particular situation
2455857 im sure the next time he gets an opportunity to play he will try to take some of the experiences he had last night and build off those
2455858 i think every day is important whether its a game or practice or a meeting
2455859 its definitely a new experience but i was prepared to play well by the coaches
2455860 the lineups are deeper and the pitching will be just as good as what theyre sending out there but i do think they have a chance to make some noise
2455861 timmy welch is a really good pitcher and brad monroe has proven to be a big game pitcher as well at least for the first two games theyll be in a position to win
2455862 this is my fifth year and weve had a lot of success in recent years i think we have a good mix of players this year we have three real good starting pitchers and our offense has been there when we needed it i think weve had to come from behind to win our last three games
2455863 the year we were there new jersey rhode island massachusetts and connecticut seemed to be a notch above the others
2455864 we could have beaten one of those teams but we werent winning that tournament
2455865 the year we went the pitching was a little bit better than what we faced back home but i think portsmouth has a little bit more talent than we did they were the most talented team in our state i think theyll be fine
2455866 i just want people to know nothing is going to happen right away
2455867 at the optimum things wont be ready until september 2011
2455868 this preliminary schedule was developed just working around a june 2009 referendum date that you informed me of
2455869 i would propose that this is a lengthy schedule and some of the individual line items may possibly be reduced in time frame or accelerated
2455870 its not to early to ask people who want to get involved to contact us
2455871 i had a couple of serious claims like this when business have been closed down and the owners cant keep their heads but not meredith she was amazing she saw what she needed to do and did it
2455872 we got the best team in here and they got along really well
2455873 the plumber came in all this past week at 4 a m to get this done
2455874 we got a new floor and the kitchen is bigger and brighter theres new equipment im in culinary heaven ive worked in many restaurants but ive never come into a brand new kitchen before im waiting to cook something
2455875 a few of us had input after the floors were put in we got in there and looked at it in terms of where the shelves were going to go we got to fix the things that bothered us theres no more being in the way of each other
2455876 we have great coverage its just a matter of waiting until it all comes through
2455877 gt lake ontario behind them maggie hollfelder grills up an order as friend sue cummings waits on a customer at maggies north shore hots at the beach at durand eastman park
2455878 my son kevin saw a hot dog cart on craigs list an internet site last winter and suggested it
2455879 it just sat in our yard all winter and we laughed and giggled and cooked on it
2455880 i bet when we get back to school well probably wish we were out here
2455881 there are just a great bunch of people down here
2455882 i do love my other job and the little kids
2455883 i have people tell me what a great idea this is and that theyre so happy im here
2455884 we have retained counsel and we did file an opposition to a request to certify this bargaining unit
2455885 at this point we await the response of the union representative and the public employee labor relations board
2455886 when dealing with labor relations you have to avoid unfair labor practices
2455887 there are many reasons why people want to unionize but primarily its to have a collective bargaining unit to spell out their benefit package
2455888 during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared this would become known
2455889 you watch them and learn a lot some frustration but mostly anticipation and excitement
2455890 i loved it thats why i decided for a career in firefighting
2455891 when i got that call saying they wanted me to come to brunswick it was a huge relief and an excitement i cant explain
2455892 i enjoy helping people and seeing the relief on peoples faces when you just saved their house from burning to the ground i love excitement too theres a lot of unknowns in firefighting
2455893 you dont go to work and do the same thing every day
2455894 its an awesome career choice hes pursuing im proud that hes going to be a fireman
2455895 its nothing im ever going to get out of my head
2455896 the water had her pinned against an apple tree and she was holding onto her son
2455897 she was yelling for help i cant hold onto him much longer
2455898 it poured so hard you couldnt see two feet in front of you for a really long time
2455899 there was so much roar from the water rushing its amazing the fire department heard the screams
2455900 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2455901 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2455902 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2455903 it came about as a suggestion from uss new hampshire commissioning committee vice chairman doug bates
2455904 i thought it was a fun idea to have a beer produced in honor of the event
2455905 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew
2455906 and i guess they had a great time doing it
2455907 we get a lot of requests from private people to do special beers and we say no to virtually all of them
2455908 but we thought this one had a lot of merit and it was worth pursuing
2455909 weve been sitting down and talking about it for a few days and we dont have a conclusion yet
2455910 one day we need one thing and the next day we need another thing
2455911 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2455912 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2455913 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2455914 i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go
2455915 ive had a couple of dings this year but ive been able to take some days off i know i have a few years left hopefully it is with san diego
2455916 she not only believes in the responsible use of our armed forces but in taking care of our service members veterans and their families unlike john mccain george bush and their congressional allies carol does not forget veterans once the bullets have stopped flying
2455917 shea porter is a true american patriot fighting for veterans and their families im proud to have her representing me in washington
2455918 im a life long republican but im sure going to vote for carol shea porter this year when it comes to constituent services shes on a whole different level

2455925 i support the school boards decision to go to the left i think thats the only logical design
2455926 i think going to the right would be fiscally not as attractive and provide a school that is not quite as attractive i think people would drive by and say what were they thinking
2455927 ive thought about this a long time and i think the education of our children is most important thing we do when it comes down to it if the ball players need to play on different field i will support eminent domain
2455928 one of the main jobs of the council is managing the city purse strings and all the money that is spent to keep city the one of the best places to live
2455929 i think the budget process is one of the most important things the council does and i have a lot of experience doing that
2455930 this summer however has the most coordinated effort thats ever been done
2455931 i have been involved in local farming for years and in the past it happened at random or occasionally this year there is a collaboration of local groups and we set it up in advance with cross roads house the farmers are getting into the habit of gleaning
2455932 saving us money at the grocery store and feeding our residents better than ever even introducing them to foods they have not had
2455933 oh yeah thats probably because your body was withdrawing from zoloft
2455934 nope im already middle of the road i dont need anything extra to keep me there
2455935 trust me if i begin to think i can walk on water or that i can fix my horrible extended family by off ing them and rebuilding them im sure youll be the first to hear about it
2455936 thats ok im enough meds as it is one happy pill is enough
2455937 well we need to keep an eye on your thyroid so were doing a cbc
2455938 well youre free for 6 months unless i see something i dont like in your results
2455939 something he doesnt like what in the hell does that mean
2455940 umm i had two this morning at 5 00 for breakfast
2455941 dont worry sweetie i got your back and ill put a good word in for you with the doctor if you get a bad reading
2455942 wow this is really really hurting me so do i get a sticker or a lollipop afterwards
2455943 oh my god honey i must have hit a tendon or ligament
2455944 is it normal to feel so sick and dizzy because im not doing do well
2455945 wow looks like all of those cheese sandwiches arent going to let me get any blood
2455946 that was the house where the window got broken working with greenland and north hampton police we were able to tie the driver and passenger to the abenaqui and the theft of wiring
2455947 one place had a video and the others had tire impressions we were able to match to their car
2455948 this was a case of a seacoast police team working together at the crime scenes to solve it
2455949 a lot simon ps lern how to spell his name
2455950 she may not be flashy but she is always correct
2455951 he has not been happy in this arena and was tense and looking for the exit he wanted to get back to his friends
2455952 i was thinking i would score in the 30s he was going so light and soft so to get a 51 is disappointing there were flower pots and cameras but hes been in the arena before and taken no notice of them
2455953 i think the spooks were a nervous reaction perhaps it would have been better if it had been 10 degrees hotter
2455954 but after his test in aachen he gave me the best ride across country i ever had so i hope he will again here the course is not a long one but there is a lot packed into it and horses are going to be tired it may be only an eight minute course but it will feel more like a 12 minute burghley
2455955 considering what a short time i have had him i could not have hoped for better i was happy to go early
2455956 i most certainly did not become a police officer to write speeding tickets but it is part of our job to keep them the public safe
2455957 you have the best view into the vehicle and youre protected from the door swinging out
2455958 itd be ideal if we didnt have to write any tickets at all
2455959 our whole goal is voluntary compliance we want drivers to think about it
2455960 i thought they would be perfect to kick off the upcoming childrens festival
2455961 if evanescence the female fronted hard rock band scored a shrek movie
2455962 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2455963 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2455964 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2455965 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2455966 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2455967 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2455968 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2455969 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2455970 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2455971 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2455972 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2455973 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2455974 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
2455975 i had a couple of serious claims like this when business have been closed down and the owners cant keep their heads but not meredith she was amazing she saw what she needed to do and did it
2455976 we got the best team in here and they got along really well
2455977 the plumber came in all this past week at 4 a m to get this done
2455978 we got a new floor and the kitchen is bigger and brighter theres new equipment im in culinary heaven ive worked in many restaurants but ive never come into a brand new kitchen before im waiting to cook something
2455979 a few of us had input after the floors were put in we got in there and looked at it in terms of where the shelves were going to go we got to fix the things that bothered us theres no more being in the way of each other
2455980 we have great coverage its just a matter of waiting until it all comes through
2455981 we have retained counsel and we did file an opposition to a request to certify this bargaining unit
2455982 at this point we await the response of the union representative and the public employee labor relations board
2455983 when dealing with labor relations you have to avoid unfair labor practices
2455984 there are many reasons why people want to unionize but primarily its to have a collective bargaining unit to spell out their benefit package
2455985 please dont pee in our pool we dont swim in your toilet
2455986 if evanescence female fronted hard rock band scored a shrek movie
2455987 younger kids look up to him think of who will follow in your footsteps
2455988 if you have enough money to get a driver then do it
2455989 it came about as a suggestion from uss new hampshire commissioning committee vice chairman doug bates
2455990 i thought it was a fun idea to have a beer produced in honor of the event
2455991 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew
2455992 and i guess they had a great time doing it
2455993 we get a lot of requests from private people to do special beers and we say no to virtually all of them
2455994 but we thought this one had a lot of merit and it was worth pursuing
2455995 i just want people to know nothing is going to happen right away
2455996 at the optimum things wont be ready until september 2011
2455997 this preliminary schedule was developed just working around a june 2009 referendum date that you informed me of
2455998 i would propose that this is a lengthy schedule and some of the individual line items may possibly be reduced in time frame or accelerated
2455999 its not to early to ask people who want to get involved to contact us
2456000 that was the house where the window got broken working with greenland and north hampton police we were able to tie the driver and passenger to the abenaqui and the theft of wiring
2456001 one place had a video and the others had tire impressions we were able to match to their car
2456002 this was a case of a seacoast police team working together at the crime scenes to solve it
2456003 you watch them and learn a lot some frustration but mostly anticipation and excitement
2456004 i loved it thats why i decided for a career in firefighting
2456005 when i got that call saying they wanted me to come to brunswick it was a huge relief and an excitement i cant explain
2456006 i enjoy helping people and seeing the relief on peoples faces when you just saved their house from burning to the ground i love excitement too theres a lot of unknowns in firefighting
2456007 you dont go to work and do the same thing every day
2456008 its an awesome career choice hes pursuing im proud that hes going to be a fireman
2456009 we were having like a birthday party in here for one of my girlfriends it was nuts just a lot of commotion was going on in shop while she was here lots of customers were here and i didnt know it was kelly clarkson at the time but my sales associate recognized her
2456010 i still wasnt sure if it was her she just didnt look like you would see her on stage in fact thats why no one was sure it was her until she paid and i looked at the credit card and sure enough it read kelly clarkson i still have the receipt
2456011 i dont care if they purchase anything really i just want them to feel a good vibe here
2456012 i just have a feel for whats going on with fashion trends its in the genes
2456013 i thought it might have been oxidation due to rust
2456014 the un security council must make this matter a priority and help broker an immediate ceasefire between the parties if fighting continues thousands of families will be forced to flee and we could be faced with a humanitarian crisis
2456015 were hearing reports that the entire water supply to tskhinvali has been shut off potable water is the number one humanitarian need right now for the city and surrounding areas
2456016 its nothing im ever going to get out of my head
2456017 the water had her pinned against an apple tree and she was holding onto her son
2456018 she was yelling for help i cant hold onto him much longer
2456019 it poured so hard you couldnt see two feet in front of you for a really long time
2456020 there was so much roar from the water rushing its amazing the fire department heard the screams
2456021 i support the school boards decision to go to the left i think thats the only logical design
2456022 i think going to the right would be fiscally not as attractive and provide a school that is not quite as attractive i think people would drive by and say what were they thinking
2456023 ive thought about this a long time and i think the education of our children is most important thing we do when it comes down to it if the ball players need to play on different field i will support eminent domain
2456024 one of the main jobs of the council is managing the city purse strings and all the money that is spent to keep city the one of the best places to live
2456025 i think the budget process is one of the most important things the council does and i have a lot of experience doing that
2456026 my client is such a loser and their company cant speak for itself so i am resorting to the big pr book of cliches to hopefully make them sound a bit more interesting
2456027 when you find out three people were beaten and theres no tips no clues im just trying to put a heads up out there in the community
2456028 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2456029 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2456030 maybe i was a bit tired and i lost concentration maybe she had faster speed and i couldnt follow
2456031 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2456032 the same rules of faithfulness and commitment would have to apply as to heterosexual union
2456033 to be to the declared teaching of the church i serve and thus to discourage any developments that might imply that the position and convictions of the worldwide communion have changed
2456034 if im asked for my views as a theologian rather than a church leader i have to be honest and admit that they are as ive said
2456035 preliminary inquiries suggest the engineering vehicle slid and overturned due to its steel roller losing traction on the tow trucks tilt tray
2456036 i think anderson cooper is an opinionated hypocritical idiot who should be an adult and keep his opinion to himself he is the last person to judge anyone when he and his own family have their own issues
2456037 he was attacking the zone with like nine pitches it seemed like
2456038 he used every pitch and he worked quick and he changed speeds that was pitching in out up down changed speeds 3 2 changeup he pitched well
2456039 man h tte eine gro e koalition ohne koch probieren sollen
2456040 ich halte es f r u erst gef hrlich was sie macht
2456041 i thought the beginning was amazing all the people that it took to make it happen and how all the performers were so in sync was just unbelievable seeing all the countries come into the stadium makes you really appreciate being a part of this
2456042 its an expensive sport no doubt but the premiership is where everyone wants to be
2456043 it costs money because all the teams are good so do you have to spend yes are we prepared to spend absolutely
2456044 when you get to the premiership the level gets raised and you have to do it justice and we will do it justice
2456045 lets get promoted then not get relegated then let us be super competitive
2456046 lets not say champions league football because that is not realistic for now we would be spitting in the wind
2456047 things will take time and money and that will come
2456048 i have not exactly been known for my goalscoring in the past so i am delighted
2456049 last season being in the bolton side it wasnt that easy bearing in mind i hardly got any chances
2456050 i am playing with a different class of player this year and they find you when you make runs into the box
2456051 it is part of my game i am trying to improve because a goalscoring midfielder is invaluable i want to be a box to box player
2456052 the best midfielders like frank lampard and steven gerrard always get 10 15 goals a season
2456053 they set the standards and i want to be up there with those sorts of players
2456054 it is always fantastic to hear when you are being compared to great players of the past but you want compliments from current players as well
2456055 it was a nice confidence boost but i have got to keep my feet on the ground
2456056 the manager is great we have had a tough pre season and have started to wind down now he enjoys a great banter with the players
2456057 he is not a manager who doesnt talk to his players he is very hands on you listen because of what he has done in the game
2456058 it was great to come away from one big club to another and to feel wanted
2456059 hopefully i can improve here and become a much better player it was sad to leave liverpool but i had to be realistic
2456060 i played seven games and could have maybe got ten to 15 games a season but i need 40 a year at this stage of my career to make the step up i need to play
2456061 i need to prove them wrong i wont be the first or last player to leave a big club for another and it is how you react that matters
2456062 i was at manchester united as a kid even though i signed a scholarship with liverpool at 16
2456063 i went to man utd in the summer holidays when i was growing up i never signed for them but i was there from 11 to 15
2456064 manchester united will always be a massive game for me i wouldnt say it means anything different to me but at the same time it is always great if you can prove someone wrong
2456065 at 16 i met steve heighway and that was that i signed for liverpool
2456066 it never came to man utd offering me anything because i had already agreed to go to liverpool i spoke to heighway and thought thats good enough for me
2456067 i was an england schoolboy and it was not a difficult decision to make
2456068 de pvda maakt werk van werk niet alleen omdat het brood op de plank levert maar ook omdat het emanciperend werkt
2456069 alcohol has definitely played a factor with many of those arrested with incidents ranging from low level disorder assaults and public order offences like swearing and abusive behaviour
2456070 we will use all the tools at our disposal to rid the railway system of football troublemakers
2456071 we know that these people are in the minority but we dont want them spoiling things for the majority of law abiding football fans
2456072 i can blow off someones head at close range and splatter blood but i cant light a good cuban cigar
2456073 sometimes when grownups say forever they mean for a very long time

2456077 hot war in georgia as the russian air land forces launch armor columns under air cover into the sovereign state and u s ally of georgia
2456078 someone who is seeking the presidency should have some facility for the most important anchor in global affairs which is the transatlantic relationship
2456079 the major threats in the 21st century are changing but what is not changing is the vital necessity of europe and the us collaborating in meeting those challenges with europe for instance in the lead on dealing with iran this is a very disconcerting void in obamas profile
2456080 has been so busy running for president that he hasnt done much of anything as chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on european affairs
2456081 i also have heard senator obama refer continually to afghanistan and he references being on the foreign relations committee
2456082 he chairs the subcommittee on europe it has jurisdiction over nato nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan hes held not one substantive hearing to do oversight to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato i n afghanistan
2456083 well first of all i became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign at the beginning of 2007 so it is true that we havent had oversight hearings on afghanistan
2456084 all matters policies and problems concerning the continent of europe including the european member states of the north atlantic treaty organization
2456085 given the opportunity to take the reins of leadership and shape two critical areas of u s foreign policy afghanistan and our alliances in europe senator obama has done next to nothing
2456086 nato is critical to our mission in afghanistan hes held not one substantive hearing to do oversight to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with nato in afghanistan
2456087 so it is true that i havent convened any oversight hearings since i was entrusted with this responsbility
2456088 with oversight of nato relations and its role in afghanistan i believe it is time for us to focus closely on these issues
2456089 the reason obama didnt hold a hearing on nato i chair the committee every one of those committee hearings are held at full committee
2456090 nice try by biden to provide cover for a man who has been seen rarely in the senate chambers and who has very little experience to boot is it a coincidence that biden has been mentioned as a vice presidential candidate
2456091 its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2456092 there are casualties including among russian peacekeepers this is very sad and this will incur response
2456093 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
2456094 russian should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all force from sovereign georgian territory

2456103 all told employees at more than 30 of the 42
2456104 set fund raising records early in the 2008 presidential race
2456105 soon found a springboard a group of black entrepreneurs also trying to break out
2456106 checked into their problems and helped start a drive that enabled minority investment executives to win millions of dollars in business from the states giant pension funds
2456107 jay stewart executive director of an illinois watchdog group known as the better government association said that in helping these and other executives as a state senator mr obama also benefited from the kind of special interest driven politics he now decries
2456108 raising large chunks from special interests was common in illinois mr
2456109 who later became the state senate president and one of mr obamas chief mentors
2456110 in 1993 mr jones took the first crack at opening up the pension business persuading the legislature to pass a bill encouraging the multibillion dollar funds to use minority owned firms to the greatest extent feasible but by the time mr obama then a junior state senator began meeting regularly with the group in 2000 little progress had been made as a result said hermene hartman the alliance president the pension issues got a lot of attention in the discussions with mr obama
2456111 goal was always to open up doors it was as the rev jesse jackson has eloquently put it to force other industries to have their jackie robinson moment
2456112 used a 9 500 personal loan to help finance the campaign when he lost he found himself broke and fielding questions from the federal election commission about his campaign finances he later had to lend his campaign committee 11 100 more to cover refunds to donors who had inadvertently given too much
2456113 small checks from black executives who agreed to help him prepare for another run
2456114 after three months of calling longtime supporters and other democratic donors mr obama had raised only 250 000
2456115 taking advantage of the increased contribution limits newly available under a so called millionaires amendment to federal campaign laws
2456116 two of his partners donated a total of 35 000
2456117 sources confirmed the firm is loop capital markets llc of chicago
2456118 why did bho resign from that senate minority investment committee the day before he filed his federal nominating papers if he believed in the cause as these mopes call it he would have use d his higher profile to advocate more strongly for them
2456119 the study of marine mammal acoustics and behavior is an area of emerging interest for many reasons but there have been many recent advances including this recently completed study
2456120 we were fortunate to have some of the best scientists in these fields working with noaa on this pilot project it will take some time to analyze the data and see what conclusions may be drawn but in many ways this effort lays the foundation for more sophisticated collaborative efforts in the future

2456123 without proper management and increased enforcement some shark species are likely to go extinct
2456124 sharks are undoubtedly critical to maintaining the health of ocean ecosystems
2456125 shark populations must be protected and restored to ensure heallthy oceans in the future
2456126 with time running out for this session of congress oceana looks to the senate for fast action to enact the shark conservation act of 2008 into law
2456127 it wasnt until about the fifth draft that i really began to figure it out it was then that i realized hes dead

2456132 what do you mean they put the bread on our plates with tongues what are you talking about
2456133 im getting a little more comfortable kind of realizing how to pitch up here
2456134 how the hitters are and watching a lot of the older guys how they pitch and watching their pitches what works for them and which ones dont im just trying to get my feet wet and every time out get a little bit better
2456135 the last two games i thought he pitched pretty well
2456136 hes got a pretty good fastball he can throw that fastball past people and its 91 92 miles an hour
2456137 the fourth inning francisco hit a slider down and hit it pretty well
2456138 i was trying to mix some other stuff in there im kind of learning that the fastball is a good pitch to have but you also have to have some other stuff as well
2456139 say if you are feeling shit you will feel better and the world will not fall in
2456140 look at that man he is driving that lawnmower with his cock

2456147 i dont think so dude lines right there goes around the building
2456148 at that point i decided i want to be an olympian
2456149 i wanted to run the 100 meter dash which is probably the premier event in the olympics and i wanted to win a gold medal
2456150 wed watch from the living room window and just laugh
2456151 if i can beat a car i can totally beat any other human in the world right
2456152 its one of those things where it changes how youre referred to for the rest of your life youre known as an olympian
2456153 its an elite fraternity and its something that youre always going to feel good about its what most kids at some point aspire to get to
2456154 it wasnt like no one wouldnt have understood if she decided to stay on her honeymoon for a day or two
2456155 to come to china that was a great example of how committed she is she was a player that i had to have here because of how bad she really wanted it she doesnt take anything for granted
2456156 i wanted usa basketball to know that this was important for me thats the whole thing when you talk to an olympian about making it there are so many people behind them that helped them get there and that are a part of this
2456157 i know how hard she worked and i know what a dream it is for her to be an olympian
2456158 its a lot different getting the phone call but the emotion is the same just pure joy a moment where you reflect a lot on what it took to get here
2456159 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
2456160 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2456161 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2456162 denise says it is a declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue

2456259 since emerging from the collapsing soviet union as an independent state in 1991 georgia has again become the arena of conflicting interests this time between a the us and a revived russia it has also faced a tough challenge from two separatist regions abkhazia and south ossetia
2456260 over 1 300 people are reported dead after russian forces responded to a georgian attack on rebels in the breakaway province of south ossetia by mounting a full scale invasion
2456261 just over 7 days ago us forces just left the air base that is reporting to have been attacked by russian federation air force assets
2456262 we have been following events in breakaway abkhazia and south ossetia here for some years and the latest friday july 04 2008
2456263 this is a long and convoluted struggle now inflamed because partly russia will not recognise the us manufactured statelet gangster hinterland and site of huge us base called kosovo carved out of serbia see kla is cia lab bondsteel camp
2456264 so the russkis are helping the abkhazians a major smuggling route and south ossetians total pop 70 00 with their special gazprom gas supply so if the georgian gas is cut off they remain warm in winter at least
2456265 it is also related to the btc pipeline baku tblisi ceyhan and us moves to get georgia and the ukraine within the nato family threatening russias southern flank

2456275 i wanted to try to get this thing behind me so i could focus more on the season
2456276 i was excited about the season even before the new contract this has given that extra measure of knowing that im going to be taken care of here
2456277 it gives you that peace of mind that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you so i can go out there and do my job

2456288 when it comes to the quran im sure it says youre not supposed to wage war against others of the same religion
2456289 in ramadi iraq we were fighting al qaeda and al qaeda every day in the news at the time they were blowing up a mosque killing muslims and women and children to me i wasnt fighting against muslims i was fighting against extremists who had taken the religion
2456290 there were times we were going in places where instead of it having to be an ugly situation where marines dont speak arabic telling them to move from room to room instead i could speak to them
2456291 by the end of the day we were sitting there sipping tea with the iraqis in the house everybody is relaxing talking
2456292 i can never complain about being arabic and being in the military
2456293 because of the way my leaders have treated me i have nothing to complain about if anything being arab and being muslim in the military right now benefits a unit so much if anything it helps your career

2456312 where users pay extra once they have exceeded their paid for allotment similar to how many cell phone plans work cerf is not a fan of this or other metered bandwidth scenarios as it is often difficult to know how much bandwidth you will need
2456313 one problem with charging for total bytes transferred in either direction is that users will have no reasonable way to estimate their monthly costs clicking on a link can take you to an unexpected streaming site or a major file transfer
2456314 i suggest the introduction of transmission rate caps which would allow users to purchase access to the internet at a given minimum data rate and be free to transfer data at at least up to that rate in any way they wish
2456315 so the real question for todays broadband networks is not whether they need to be managed but rather how
2456316 in my view internet traffic should be managed with an eye towards applications and protocols for example a broadband provider should be able to prioritize packets that call for low latency the period of time it takes for a packet to travel from point a to point b but such prioritization should be applied across the board to all low latency traffic not just particular application providers broadband carriers should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in the market under the rubric of network management

2456321 there are three ingredients in the good life learning earning and yearning
2456322 but you see this definition of the good life now is almost totally in terms of instrumental extrinsic goods it has nothing to do with character and its joyous to watch because christians will predict that this kind of thing will be dehumanizing
2456323 i think the meaning of life is what you make of it but what i think this boils down to is doing things that make you realise that youre a living entity i e being alive for example i jumped off a plane from 18 000 feet recently that was an existential experience and what i went through when i experienced that was what made me realise what life is about i was being alive or existing likewise when i have an solving a problem no one has ever solved before this web page and so on in general doing things youre passionate about makes you realise that youre alive that is when i realise im alive im being alive and that is the meaning of life

2456352 the course is good for our car i was surprised montagny was only four tenths behind me you can see that acura is getting quicker and quicker and weve been saying that weve been a bit behind in qualifying and still been able to win overall the strategy is in our favour being a longer race but you never know with the yellows and the things going on around the race track if a yellow comes out you have to be prepared to change your mind completely and react and adapt to it our plan is to go as fast as you can and then react to it

2456359 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2456360 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2456361 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2456362 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2456363 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2456364 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2456365 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2456366 linux companies like ourselves need to work closely with people making the next wave of appliance or netbooks we need to seize it before other people fill the gap

2456369 we have been trying to resize and use open source to appeal to consumers but to be honest its tough
2456370 from a general operating system perspective theres still a lot of packages to download thats not something you are going to see my mom use

2456377 there is so much emphasis put on website design whereas i think the photography trumps all that
2456378 i want these portfolios to be like your black leather portfolio they just hold the pictures and make it easy to look at them

2456382 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end if anyone has a useful contact number for apple please let me know
2456383 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were rich enough to afford this
2456384 its a work of art with no hidden function at all
2456385 they want to get netshare back up but they want to do some technical analysis that they couldnt explain to us
2456386 apple runs the app store so youll have to ask them about the availability of this and other apps
2456387 for customers looking for a smartphone with tethering capabilities at amp t has a number of other options to choose from
2456388 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all nullrivers dan told wired
2456389 i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it
2456390 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2456391 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down

2456397 she literally cut my ass shes grinnin and thinking its fuckin funny but its not she cut me profusely and i bled profusely and i still finished the scene but we had to stop between takes and apply pressure on my anus with paper towels to stop the bleeding so he could shove his cock in there for two pops before i was bleeding again it was the dumbest thing ive ever been through in my life ill never do it again
2456398 the world has lost a beautiful ass as a result

2456453 we are constantly trying new things we know that if we get results from our products our customers will too
2456454 were in the business of generating business for our clients

2456459 we believe there is a possibility of a real economic downturn here and further continued difficulties in the credit market
2456460 if you look at the consensus forecasts theres a strong possibility of further declines in uk house prices and this type of scenario needs to be built into firms business models
2456461 when we come through that history tells us thats not something thats going to play through in months its going to be well through the year end
2456462 wed expect people to plan on that type of assumption and weve been working with individual institutions to ensure we are comfortable with their longer term plans
2456463 we deem the longer term plan to be that sort of time horizon
2456464 if people want to dampen down these cycles and to ensure banks are less likely to violently react in a downturn to some degree they will have to accept there will be less on the upturn as well
2456465 were looking to create the environment where theres the right amount of credit available to consumers

2456483 i was in crippling pain with my stomach and i kept being sick and coughing up blood in the end i felt agitated and just wanted to get out so i decided to leave a note on an envelope
2456484 i do have problems with a hernia and i am waiting for an operation but when i started coughing up blood i did get worried
2456485 nhs brits must wait 10 hours but 7 8bn spent on foreign aid
2456486 it was an ideal preparation it was a very pacy game we wanted an intense game and i think ajax gave us more than we wanted they fought for every ball and played well some players are still a bit short physically but im not really concerned we were much better defensively in the second half
2456487 in first half our position on the pitch was not right we changed that at half time and from then on it was much more difficult for ajax to play
2456488 you know arsenal we always create a lot of chances and dont always score all of them but its difficult to complain as well when you score three goals
2456489 in the whole game we were always dangerous going forward but they took advantage of two lapses of concentration and scored two fantastic goals both goals were unstoppable great finishes they were sharp incisive and took advantage of every mistake we made
2456490 we missed nasri tonight who has a little knock we missed diaby and we missed song whos at the olympics i dont know if our midfield tonight was ideal but its certainly not far from the midfield well play wednesday night
2456491 im not concerned about that but i would have been very concerned tonight if we had one or two injuries in midfield we cant afford that at the moment with nasri and diaby out its very positive for us that we have no injuries tonight
2456492 i said many times we are one body short and if you ask me who i cannot answer the question because i dont know more than you
2456493 they have intelligent strikers i was impressed by their efficiency and their movement off the ball and it could be they have a coach who was a striker
2456494 im not too much concerned about the defence because i think we played against a good attack

2456499 financially they are a massive club and hes had the full support of his board and has been able to do his stuff
2456500 as i say i have the utmost respect for him and i love beating him love it i dont know why but i like beating alex more than i do arsene wenger
2456501 but were fine i saw him after the game he said well done i think he swore at me and said you better bloody win it now if you beat united you win it so i just shut up shook his hand and walked out and we won it
2456502 i think it will be a compliment for what we did last year and thats what it should be
2456503 it should be look at these teams one won the league one won the cup well done you two go on and lift the curtain on a new season were looking forward to it

2456519 clearly we have problems on the left harry kewell has gone fabio aurelio is injured and sebastian leto cannot get a work permit

2456526 its the manager and his management team who are responsible for paying out the players salary
2456527 it is their judgement about how to use the money they paid to ljungberg in a wiser way we all have our personal opinions about freddie and his efforts for this club
2456528 the signing of fredrik ljungberg was negotiated by former chairman eggert magnusson and the financial discussions relating to the transfer had nothing to do with the manager who has never been involved in player transfer and contract negotiations
2456529 all financial matters are controlled by the board with the manager playing a full role in the identification and recommendation of players
2456530 as stated previously the termination of ljungbergs contract was agreed mutually and was in the best interests of west ham united and the player
2456531 i believe everything happens for a reason when i left tv i was like get away from it all but now im thinking why the hell not if somebody would consider me i wouldnt chuck it away
2456532 there is still a lot of work to be done but we have a good feeling about this
2456533 there is a huge pattern of car usage around the city bypass just now because a lot of these people have no public transport alternative unless they go into the city and out again
2456534 if we make the service fast reliable and comfortable then we can win these people over
2456535 the good thing is we can start with the major pinch points and gradually build the network from there
2456536 on the face of it this seems like a very good idea particularly if you are linking together all the known hotspots that people want to travel and also linking into the tram and park and rides
2456537 giving buses their own dedicated lanes will mean you are getting realistic journey times and that means genuine choice for motorists

2456539 the bond between her and her brother is just amazing weve always told bethanie what a special boy he is and what he has done for her theyre like two peas in a pod and i have never seen her look so healthy
2456540 she has even been able to go on rides at a funfair which shes never been able to do before that was so nice to see
2456541 theres a whole new world out there for her now and thats all because of joshua
2456542 shes still not able to stand the doctors are looking into that but we stand joshua in front of her as motivation because she wants to teach him to walk
2456543 in many ways he is like her big brother a mini version
2456544 i didnt really think it would work i always had doubts when it did work it took a few days to sink in
2456545 there was the possibility of a lot of side effects afterwards but bethanie has breezed through it shes really done well
2456546 he is a lovely little boy all the nurses love him and give him lots of hugs
2456547 it is an honour and a delight to have our 25th anniversary festival opened by the prime minister
2456548 the edinburgh international book festival is one of the worlds leading platforms for powerful minds and political figures scottish and international so it could not be more appropriate

2456554 the tutors at pep are a great help to me when im doing it

2456556 we provide many services and anns achievements show what can be done by anyone and the help is there for them
2456557 we try to encourage people to learn new things and ann is now going on to college which is fantastic for her and the project she showed an interest in art when she first came and we helped her realise that
2456558 i first heard about tibet when i was at edinburgh university some of my friends formed a group and i went along to a film screening and a couple of talks
2456559 as i learned more i got more and more involved i felt that my skills as a climber could be used to help
2456560 i practiced climbing up trees at corstorphine hill i spent quite a bit of time up there
2456561 i am over the moon by the support i have got from scotland my actions are a small part of a much larger campaign but i hope that a small difference has been made
2456562 i didnt go there to get arrested but i did realise the risks
2456563 i went to beijing to shine a spotlight on the way the chinese have tried to whitewash the human rights abuses in tibet
2456564 there is no five star world class hotel resort near the capital of the standard of gleneagles or loch lomond
2456565 this hotel is just 20 minutes away from edinburgh and it will be a huge boost to the capital
2456566 manor kingdom estates is now liaising with local community representatives and scottish borders council and hopes to be able to start work in late 2008
2456567 this is an exciting development for both edinburgh and the scottish borders it gives visitors the opportunity to stay in a five star rural location only a short distance from edinburgh
2456568 the city active experience is key for increasing tourism and incorporates elements of both a city break and the great outdoors this new hotel development creates the ideal base for such a break
2456569 the new hotel will give an extra dimension to the accommodation offering in edinburgh and also the scottish borders
2456570 we are really enthusiastic about acquiring a site in the south east of scotland to compliment what weve already delivered in the west of scotland through cameron house at loch lomond
2456571 ultimately our vision is that the hotel will act as a catalyst to improving the existing rutherford castle golf course to championship standard and ultimately attracting a pga event to the area
2456572 he was in high spirits as were the rest of the passengers and he had taken a drink
2456573 it sounds like a money issue to me i cant see how it would affect the front stonework as well as the roofing and flooring i think it would be a terrible shame to lose the school
2456574 removing the asbestos would destroy the very elements of the building
2456575 i have lost count of how many times i have had discussions with council officials when making plans for improvements and asking are there resources allocated for future maintenance
2456576 after a great deal of work the centre was upgraded now a few years later it is dirty there is graffiti on the walls just one bin overgrown shrub areas and lighting not working

2456642 i forgave her and understood that completely but i didnt know scarlett from a hole in the wall i thought she was too young she was only 19 years old at the time
2456643 but i was in a hole and had to get someone fairly quickly i knew scarlett was a great actress and a beauty but i didnt know if she was really what i had written i hired her and became totally captivated by her
2456644 i would always call her as i did with diane and mia for years mia was a wonderful actress and she never let me down the same would be true with scarlett

2456655 last year we thought as a team we were ready to go that maybe we had the maturity and character to win a championship

2456657 the maturity level is totally different than last year i think were more ready to handle tough situations thats where youre going to find a big difference

2456664 the evidence is pretty convincing that the models give a good simulation of climate
2456665 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease we wanted to find out if it impacts their behaviour as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
2456666 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
2456667 these findings suggest that even if some individuals in a population have high levels of testosterone they can impact the behavior of those around and drive the transmission of diseases transmitted by close contact such as the respiratory pathogen bordetella
2456668 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2456669 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2456670 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2456671 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways

2456690 most issues in this county relate directly to growth growth affects traffic our schools our tax rates i think that growth should be managed in the interest of the entire community
2456691 i think government should consider all of the consequences of new growth and evaluate the impacts and determine whether a given proposal is going to cost more than it brings in new tax revenue you weigh all of those to determine if it makes sense for the entire community and not just the person who is seeking to do the development
2456692 it will prepare us to compete economically in the future if we do these things now
2456693 the commercial impact fees are brutal i think it is really detrimental to small businesses the worse thing you can do is put additional costs on small locally owned businesses that you want to see expand
2456694 you have concurrency problems you have to come back to a sales tax you have to revisit a sales tax i also want to see a portion of property tax revenue from new growth set aside for transportation concurrency is a planning tool to be used if you dont use it correctly it can be used as a weapon that is what is happening now

2456721 generation x who were targeted in the 1990s have grown up and the show is already creating buzz in generation y
2456722 i think its a no brainer in our initial discussions with producers we were talking about the issues that faced generation x and they havent gone away
2456723 its going to be a reflection of all the best elements from the initial series but quite clearly it will have grown with the times also because television is a lot smarter now than it was in the early 1990s
2456724 coach mike mchugh gave us a set plan on what we were going to do and how wed play defence and offence in patches we did that were just really happy that we got the win
2456725 we missed a lot of shots that we normally make
2456726 but it was the first olympics for a lot of very young players they all came out and tried their best the main thing was to get the win
2456727 now the pressures off us im sure everyone will come out and play a bit better next time
2456728 its the biggest event in the world and its been a phenomenal event so far all of us have done so much work we wanted to win so badly you know when you want something sometimes it doesnt come off as well as you like but in the end we won and that was the important thing
2456729 we stuck with it and even though they kept making runs and making runs i think we used our heads wisely and its a great confidence booster
2456730 some dont play big minutes but everyones got the confidence to come on and youve got to put up the shot if youre available she did a great job
2456731 weve always lacked the size and athleticism compared to these countries were used to just trying to focus on what we can do well
2456732 we sacrificed our opening ceremony to make sure we were straight for this game and thats added pressure as well as what the whole of new zealand has on us
2456733 we were just trying to take it as another game but its so much more than that you have so much pride going out there and you want to do your best on the olympic stage it was really special
2456734 were shorter than a lot of teams but i think were used to it

2456883 there are other things that also contribute to risk not enough attention has been paid to taking control of those problems
2456884 its also associated with other problems like obesity and diabetes

2456897 the truth of the matter is that it has already become a matter of consensus that mrs oyo is nans messiah on account of her impressive performance since she took over the baton of leadership at the agency she has always brought to play her administrative acumen for the betterment of the agency almost all of us now are proud to be employees of nan because of her administrative style which has emboldened our confidence and commitment to service we are well remunerated now due to her initiative and weve been enjoying other incentives of service since she took over this was not the case in the past
2456898 since my appointment we all have been making concerted efforts at nan to ensure we build it up to global standards we cannot afford to be na ve about the development around the world and its increasingly becoming obvious that we are left with no option than to join the global trend in terms of our news dissemination and other related services already we have commenced and almost concluded the renovation work at our headquarters we are also working round the clock to establish permanent offices for nan in all the 36 states of the federation we intend to brand them to our taste and ensure a unique operational skill in particular we intend to extend our services by going multi media an effort that would enable us supply motion pictures to television stations across the country and supply radio stations including federal radio corporation of nigeria frcn with news items

2456922 viene dal mio campetto della grola terra benedetta di vigneti e ciliegi non ce n unaltra come quella per il recioto

2456924 che meraviglia e dolce sa di ciliegie sotto spirito e ancora cioccolato con una punta di vaniglia e mandorle amare nel finale come il tema del flauto quando si ripresenta rinnovato nel ritmo e nella melodia perch la ciotola piange
2456925 e legno di vite dei campi della grola la terra non dei contadini di certi padroni vogliono venderla
2456926 ma se la vendono allora che ne sar dei vigneti e luva e di questo recioto

2456936 h tte jeder politische gegner ein paradebeispiel in der hand dass der spd auch zuzutrauen w re eine solche konstellation auf bundesebene auszunutzen
2456937 respekt frau ypsilanti seit monaten wird sie mit begriffen wie machtgeil arrogant widerspenstig belegt eigenschaften die man auch anders benennen kann z b mutig unbeirrbar belastbar eigenschaften die einer spitzenpolitikerin gut zu gesicht stehen insbesondere einer deren politik nicht durch zahlreiche aufsichtsratsposten beeinflusst wird und die sich mit ihren inhaltlichen positionen gegen die industrieverbundene altherrenriege in cdu fdp und auch spd und deren neoliberale politik stellt kein wunder dass diese nichts unversucht lassen um sie zu fall zu bringen hoffentlich ohne erfolg eine hessische ministerpr sidentin ypsilanti ist nicht nur f r hessen sondern sicher auch f r die deutsche politik belebend sie w rde vielleicht deutlich machen dass eine gerechtere sozialere politik m glich ist ohne dass alles zusammenbricht dass es m glich ist ber klimaschutz nicht nur zu reden sondern energiepolitik zu ver ndern dass lebensnotwendige bereiche wie wasser energie infrastruktur nicht privatisiert werden sollten auch wenn der verkauf kurzfristig geld bringt ich f nde es gut wenn auch die fr wieder mehr ber politische inhalte berichten w rde es w re auch w nschenswert wenn politiker der spd linken courage zeigen und sich ffentlich hinter andrea ypsilanti stellen w rden anstatt so rumzueiern etwas mehr risikobereitschaft und einstehen f r politische inhalte sowie loyalit t mit denen die gerade im wind stehen das t te sicher auch den umfragewerten der spd gut
2456938 zu dieser debatte die langsam zur unendlichen geschichte wird m chte ich eine fundamentale tatsache beitragen in hessen haben 140 769 w hler f r die linke gestimmt in deutschland sind es einige millionen in den neuen bundesl ndern ist die linke eine volkspartei wer eine regierungsbeteiligung einer zugelassenen partei kategorisch ausschlie t degradiert wahlberechtigte zu w hlern zweiter klasse gerade die union die 1991 ohne bedenken mandatstr ger und mitglieder der ost cdu aufnahm fordert parlamentsentscheidungen die mit stimmen der linken getroffen werden d rfe es nicht geben ein u erst fragw rdiges demokratieverst ndnis die begr ndung die mitglieder der linken h tten ihre sed vergangenheit nicht aufgearbeitet ist nur vorgeschoben in wahrheit sieht man nur die eigenen pfr nde gef hrdet gerade in hessen hat die cdu prominenz anders als die vorstandsmitglieder der linken keine lupenreine weste als normalb rger w ren sie vorbestraft
2456939 nichts w re mir lieber als roland koch vom hocker zu holen nur sind die methoden frau ypsilantis unehrlich vor den wahlen schreien niemals mit den linken und nach einer gescheiterten wahl na ja die linken sind ja gar nicht so schlimm wie ich dachte das l sst erkennen dass es nicht um politik geht sondern um macht was macht die linken eigentlich so schlimm die unbew ltigte vergangenheit da h tte die spd auch noch einiges zu tun es w re gut und ehrlich wenn frau ypsilanti sich neuwahlen stellen w rde dabei k nnte sie nur sauber gewinnen oder sauber verlieren

2456950 im aware this forum has drawn many criticisms from many quarters i dont have a problem with criticism there are demonstrators outside you can hear them
2456951 we have absolutely no quarrel with them they are exercising their freedom of speech we hope theyll be allowed to carry out their demonstration peacefully were certainly not lodging any police report
2456952 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
2456953 you represent umno i represent the muslims im ashamed by your behaviour islam does not condone this behaviour do not make use of islam
2456954 ladies and gentlemen im going to close this forum right after everyone sits down please sit down
2456955 its unfortunate that we could not carry on with the forum its a real shame we had to stop the forum due to the advice from the police
2456956 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso
2456957 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso
2456958 perhaps it can be said that seismic changes are taking place in malaysia because there has been no political renewal and special interest groups are entrenched perhaps the race based system which both lee and anwar challenged under which this group preserves its interests is no longer tenable in the age of the internet perhaps too many malays who support anwar now realise that malaysian malaysia or reformasi is what the country needs to lift the masses out of poverty not an astronaut or istanas if so then perhaps lee was right after all
2456959 that the seeds of malaysian malaysia planted four decades ago and dormant so long have suddenly taken root and germinated as reformasi
2456960 as the datuk seri anwar ibrahim saga unfolds before our eyes reflecting a similar episode 10 years ago it is strange that singaporeans do not experience a sense of deja vu not of the first episode but of aug 9 1965 while the absence of deja vu may be attributed to the passage of time of more than 40 years anyone who reads minister mentor lee kuan yews memoir a bestseller in singapore cannot fail to notice the parallels between lees battle against umno and anwars challenge against the same juggernaut
2456961 it sounded like such a good idea a year ago to get your ass up at midnight
2456962 design thinking can be applied to all nature of challenges
2456963 the exercise got us thinking about how to remake mornings
2456964 so were sitting at the train station during the morning commute and all these people are rushing past it was this beautiful moment
2456965 as a bunch of cynical new yorkers we thought oh this is going to be great
2456966 heres how idea meetings work in tv news we did that i saw that i hate that
2456967 our hope is that pretty soon the takeaway will be not just a radio program but an active environment
2456968 in malaysia religion is sensitive its not like in indonesia where they can marry freely like suharto hes muslim but his wife is christian in malaysia we have our federal constitution what they are doing is trying to destroy it
2456969 for me as a muslim i object to non muslims raising such a sensitive issue dont touch on the issue of religion thats a personal matter
2456970 its unfortunate that the forum coud not go on theres no conclusion for me its hanging
2456971 when you do a forum behind closed doors like this the people outside dont know who are on the panel they should have it outside like dataran merdeka
2456972 when you talk about people coming into islam there will be issues the people downstairs they dont know that
2456973 they make assumptions for those of us who are mature and educated we can think for ourselves but not everyone who came today are educated so they become very emotional because of this sensitive issue
2456974 so today there were political elements there were some people who did not give correct information
2456975 we can give our views on religion but the focus should not only be on islam
2456976 conversion to islam article 121 1a of the federal constitution subashini amp shamala revisited
2456977 it is something sad but happens in all divorce matters what i saw its not an issue of religion but how the people handled the matter the law is there the execution of the law is how its done per se its not an issue of conversion
2456978 but there is a twist in other court cases the pain and suffering is heard on both sides in this case because of the legal system where there are two jurisdictions the non converting spouse is confused and terrified thats why the heartbreak is exponentially increased in this situation
2456979 there is a problem and were trying to reconcile the differences trying to see whats the best way to move forward the problem will not go away unless we deal with it its a very human issue and as malaysians it is our responsibility to find ways to deal with it
2456980 apart from the legal issues we must focus on the humanitarian issues i think it is important to realise that saravanan subashini and shamala are not just names but real people

2457002 my departments elearning strategy includes the design and development of brief elearning modules as a main staple the majority of elearning courses we offer our employees take
2457003 30 minutes is about the maximum less than 15 is too short the exact number of minutes between 15 and 30 should be dictated by the depth and number of objectives in the learning lesson in a one hour course its absolutely fine to have two 18 minute lessons and one 24 minute lesson
2457004 i have found a sweet spot for learning chunks around the 10 15 minute range

2457008 ich freue mich dass wir jetzt eine zus tzliche alternative im sturm haben die uns in der neuen saison weiterhelfen wird
2457009 ein spiel gegen rapid ist immer etwas besonderes da braucht es eigentlich keine extra motivation
2457010 viele viele fans sind auch mich zugegangen und wollten dass ich weitermache hundert prozent der leute wollten das so viel anerkennung freut einen nat rlich
2457011 having been restructured out of the company was not the worst thing that could have happened living under that stress of not knowing what was going to happen was the most stressful thing
2457012 in my private practice within the last year or two the stress level of my patients has increased dramatically
2457013 a lot of time it will come down to family stress job issues economic issues people cant make ends meet a lot of marital dysfunction people overworked complaining about bosses i try and help people put these issues into perspective
2457014 with what we are going through now the real estate market people on the verge of foreclosure or losing jobs without knowing what is happening tomorrow it can cause a chronic insult to our body it may increase chances of depression and anxiety and lower our immune defenses and make us more susceptible to develop disease
2457015 it is known that chronic stress stimulates the laying down of extra fat in the abdominal area and has been associated with an increased risk of diabetes heart disease and hypertension
2457016 acute stress mobilizes with adrenaline and then hopefully the body adapts
2457017 but if its left in overdrive because of chronic stressors then the long term effects on biology sleep and appetite disturbance irritability episodic violence control issues can be associated with the wear and tear on our systems
2457018 but ive noticed a drop off in other patients for economic reasons
2457019 one way we define stress is an individuals adaptive capacity to demands placed on that individual
2457020 people readily experience stress as painful while others may experience it as an opportunity
2457021 life brings these things and the way i acted was going to show them how to act when something in the future goes bad what they thought of me and how i handled myself in front of them was important
2457022 those runs allowed me to be by myself and to think and rethink and reposition those thoughts it was an opportunity to work out physically but also to put myself together again
2457023 that was a daunting experience i couldnt remember what ive done you have to go through a lifetime
2457024 eighty six percent of chinese people surveyed said they were content with the countrys direction up from 48 percent in 2002 and 82 percent of chinese were satisfied with their national economy up from 52 percent
2457025 russians were the third most satisfied people with their countrys direction at 54 percent despite western concerns about authoritarian trends
2457026 i just havent been able to keep up with rent
2457027 im in parking ticket hell i just have surmounted so many
2457028 i had heard about the stand down over the years but until now i hadnt needed their services
2457029 i am impressed with all that they have on site
2457030 this is like being at a fair because its not like this in the real system
2457031 ive been called an idiot a ton of times but i dont care
2457032 i always wanted to be on broadway but i never quite made it there
2457033 i just want to make sure you wont freak out ok
2457034 we dont go around and tell people to get out or anything
2457035 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2457036 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2457037 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2457038 we were able to get things going in the passing game we were able to establish the run game early which kind of softened up the defense youre talking about one of the best defenses in the league here even though they were missing some of their players
2457039 we were able to get things going the way we were able to in practice this is something that we can watch the film and grow on there were a lot of positive things happening today
2457040 we obviously know that last year that was our achilles heel a little bit the one positive thing out of that whole deal is sustaining drives keeping the chains moving eating up some clock picking up some yards and when we get down there being able to capitalize and cap it off with a touchdown
2457041 it gives you peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2457042 i wanted to try to get this thing behind me so i could focus more on the season
2457043 it will appear as a six year deal but theres a lot of situations where it could end up being as short as three
2457044 it could be four it could be five and it could be six everything ive ever seen in a contract is in this deal
2457045 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2457046 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization
2457047 dat bedrag is te laag om niet te zeggen belachelijk
2457048 this use of legal action to silence the opposition is characteristic of authoritarian governments

2457137 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2457138 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2457139 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2457140 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2457141 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2457142 with an intense individualism which the frontier atmosphere put into the man of the south also comes violence and an idealistic hedonistic romanticism this romanticism is also fueled by the south conflict with the yankee violence manifests itself in mob action such as lynching and private dealings
2457143 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2457144 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2457145 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2457146 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2457147 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2457148 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2457149 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2457150 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2457151 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2457152 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2457153 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2457154 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2457155 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2457156 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2457157 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2457158 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2457159 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2457160 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2457161 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2457162 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2457163 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2457164 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2457165 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2457166 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2457167 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2457168 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2457169 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2457170 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2457171 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2457172 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2457173 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2457174 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2457175 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2457176 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2457177 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2457178 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2457179 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2457180 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2457181 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2457182 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2457183 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2457184 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2457185 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

2457228 eine pole position ist immer sch n und wenn man dann noch einen kleinen rekord hat ist das nat rlich umso sch ner
2457229 ich pers nlich gebe da wenig drauf ich will eigentlich immer nur so weit wie m glich vorne stehen das haben wir geschafft das auto war gut in meiner runde hatte ich einen kleinen fehler ein zwei zehntel w re es wohl noch schneller gegangen aber nichts desto trotz bin ich gl cklich und zufrieden wir m ssen auch f r das rennen gar nicht mehr so viel machen denn wir haben bereits ein gutes renn setup
2457230 gratulation an unseren rekordmann lucas luhr hat einen guten job gemacht pole position mit einer tollen zeit
2457231 ich denke auch f r morgen sieht es gut aus es wird sicherlich ein schweres rennen das ber vier stunden geht wir haben gute voraussetzungen mit der pole position selbst wenn sie bei einem so langen rennen nicht so wichtig ist entscheidend ist dass wir im rennen konstant schnell sind und das sollten wir sein
2457232 ich bin recht zufrieden wir haben einen teil des ersten trainings wegen kleinerer probleme verloren und zun chst keine gute balance
2457233 es hat eine weile gedauert die verlorene zeit aufzuholen sogar w hrend des qualifyings haben wir das auto noch verbessert ich denke es ist nun zu 90 prozent so wie es sein sollte und wir k nnen uns auf das rennen freuen mit vollen tanks f hlt sich das auto gut an
2457234 ich lerne noch immer aber es l uft eigentlich schon ziemlich gut
2457235 so langsam f hle ich mich im auto richtig wohl ich muss die rennstrecke das auto und das team noch besser kennenlernen f r das rennen muss ich mich noch steigern aber bis jetzt bin ich ganz zufrieden

2457297 one of my biggest concerns has been injuries how that could just dash away all kinds of planning and of course to have a player go down like dwyane wade one of the real premier players in the world that raised some real questions hes been really injured for two years
2457298 i saw a couple of explosive things but he wasnt back yet
2457299 he was really refocused on coming back and proving to people that he could
2457300 because some people doubted that and i suggested to him he create a little bit of an edge
2457301 and i didnt have to sell myself he just saw that i had the eye of the tiger and i was ready to go
2457302 there was no doubt in my mind he would be ready
2457303 so before we even got here i already knew he was gonna be ready he promised me that he was gonna be ready so what hes doing now is not a surprise to me
2457304 i dont think he would come out this summer if he wasnt healthy
2457305 and if hes healthy we know what kind of basketball hes capable of playing so we expected that before we even started
2457306 the way hes getting to the basket right now is unbelievable theres nobody right now that can stay in front of him

2457311 communion in the hand has not been and will not be accepted by heaven this is a sacrilege in the eyes of the eternal father and must not be continued for you only add to your punishment when you continue on in the ways that have been found to be unpleasing to the eternal father
2457312 there is an apostolic letter on the existence of a special valid permission for this communion in the hand but i tell you that i am not in favor of this practice nor do i recommend it
2457313 signifies the reverence of the faithful for the eucharist provides that holy communion will be distributed with due reverence is more conducive to faith reverence and humility it communion in the hand carries certain dangers with it which may arise from the new manner of administering holy communion the danger of a loss of reverence for the august sacrament of the altar of profanation of adulterating the true doctrine
2457314 wherever i go in the whole world the thing that makes me the saddest is watching people receive communion in the hand
2457315 what do you think is the worst problem in the world today
2457316 behind communion in the hand i wish to repeat and make as plain as i can is a weakening a conscious deliberate weakening of faith in the real presence whatever you can do to stop communion in the hand will be blessed by god
2457317 there can be no doubt that communion in the hand is an expression of the trend towards desacralization in the church in general and irreverence in approaching the eucharist in particular why for gods sake should communion in the hand be introduced into our churches when it is evidently detrimental from a pastoral viewpoint when it certainly does not increase our reverence and when it exposes the eucharist to the most terrible diabolical abuses there are really no serious arguments for communion in the hand but there are the most gravely serious kinds of arguments against it
2457318 with communion in the hand a miracle would be required during each distribution of communion to avoid some particles from falling to the ground or remaining in the hand of the faithful
2457319 as in the past cannot you recognize the mystery of heaven and earth did not the staff of moses turn into a serpent in the will of god did not the river in egypt turn into blood in the will of god and cannot god in his will come to you changing the bread and wine into the actual presence the real presence the factual presence of his body and blood
2457320 you must not take the body of my son in your hand you open the door for the entrance of evil spirits to defile my sons body the consecrated fingers of a duly ordained man of god the priest shall place my son into your mouth and you must absorb his body with goodness and love
2457321 my son is not pleased with the manner in which his body and blood is being given to all of the humans upon earth
2457322 communion in the hand has not been and will not be accepted by heaven this is a sacrilege in the eyes of the eternal father and must not be continued for you only add to your punishment when you continue on in the ways that have been found to be unpleasing to the eternal father
2457323 a priest is a man of god chosen solely from the world to be a representative of the son of god as a man of god he brings to you the body and blood of your savior
2457324 i tell you my brothers and sister that none shall take in his or her hands the purified body of your savior only the consecrated fingers and hands of the representative of christ the lord shall give and bring this gift to mankind st theresa october 2 1975
2457325 i ask you my children you ask me many times in your prayers shall you accept my sons body in your hands i say no and no again for reason
2457326 you cannot judge all those about you my children who have accepted this diabolical practice under the guise of leadership
2457327 it was my children a sinister plan from the depths of hell to remove the knowledge of the divinity of my son from among you
2457328 again and again i wander to and fro directing my children to remain close to the eucharist the bread of life but do not become misguided do not accept my sons body in your hands
2457329 satan lucifer came as an angel of light and set his agents among the hierarchy of my sons church and deluded them all manner of abominations are being committed upon my sons body now
2457330 many are giving my body in a manner that can only be called blasphemy
2457331 my child you ask why i cry i shed tears of great anguish i watch anew the desecration to my sons body being committed upon earth none shall place their hands upon his body
2457332 my son has given you in trust those he has chosen among mankind to represent him your priests none others shall carry my son to mankind you shall not defile his body by giving him into the hands of women or those that have not been prepared by the father as legally ordained priests in the houses of god laziness preoccupied with the world and the pleasures of the flesh

2457392 has raised the bar dauntingly high for the organisers of london 2012
2457393 every decade or so an olympics will capture the spirit of the age it is difficult to imagine what london will stand for in four years time when the world gather in stratford in east london for the celebration of the 30th olympiad
2457394 boris johnson and his team will celebrate and then feel the pressure
2457395 beijing spent a mind blowing amount on the opening ceremony almost 3 000 pounds per second which is a sobering thought for all those london council taxpayers will 2012 top that financial outlay
2457396 with this cap in place and costs rising compromises look likely
2457397 russland betrachtet immer noch benachbarte gebiete als seine einflussgebiete wobei gewinne f r den westen zwangsl ufig verluste f r russland bedeuten in diesem kontext mag das angebot der nato an die ukraine und georgien emp rend erscheinen
2457398 der georgische pr sident saakaschwili stemmt sich gegen die einsch chterungsversuche der russen und setzt auf die hilfe westlicher l nder doch er macht sich illusionen die nato wird kaum einen krieg gegen russland riskieren um georgien zu retten
2457399 zu lange haben die beteiligten akteure am pulverfass kaukasus gez ndelt
2457400 saakaschwili ist vielleicht ein hei sporn ein selbstm rder ist er nicht v lkerrechtlich hat er ohnehin alle argumente auf seiner seite der landstrich geh rt nun einmal zu georgien russland kann an einer weiteren eskalation des konflikts nicht gelegen sein vor allem dann nicht wenn es daf r von georgien und dem westen freie hand f r abchasien bekommt
2457401 kriege habe eine innere logik die sich selten nach der frage richtet was es zu gewinnen oder verlieren gibt oder ob der gewinn den blutzoll lohnt die konflikte um separatistische kaukasus republiken sind daf r ein beispiel lange zeit galt es im westen als ausgemacht dass moskau nicht an einer eskalation gelegen sein kann diese einsch tzung war offenbar falsch russische panzer sind auf dem weg tiflis hat die usa um hilfe gebeten nun findet sich washington in einer ungewohnten rolle es muss verhindern dass aus dem kampf um eine l cherlich kleine provinz ein stellvertreterkrieg zwischen ost und west wird
2457402 der georgische krieg ist gef hrlich weit ber die region hinaus wird er zum stellvertreterkonflikt zwischen ost und west bedeutet das eine globale konfrontation f r europa hat das erhebliche konsequenzen vor allem wirtschaftlicher art stichwort erd l und erdgas
2457403 die konflikte ob nun um berg karabach tschetschenien abchasien oder s dossetien wurden eingefroren aber nicht gel st zumindest im falle s dossetiens geht es der westlich orientierten zentralregierung in georgien die mit der versprochenen nato mitgliedschaft ber eine trumpfkarte verf gt auch um den machtkampf mit moskau
2457404 mit seiner entscheidung s dossetien zu befreien oder wie er sagte die verfassungsordnung wiederherzustellen hat der georgische pr sident einen riesigen fehler begangen wie fr her slobodan milosevic hat er nicht begriffen dass sein land nur zwischen dem abschied von den abtr nnigen republiken abchasien und s dossetien und dem zerfall des landes infolge blutiger konflikte w hlen kann wahrscheinlich hat georgiens pr sident listig darauf gesetzt dass am freitag als die olympischen spiele begannen russland neutral bleiben w rde das erwies sich als naiv

2457407 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2457408 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2457409 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2457416 64 bit operating systems are becoming more mainstream and finally enable user memory to shed the 2gb limitation of 32 bit os
2457417 moreover the latest multi core systems are capable of simultaneous execution of highly complex workloads each commanding its own virtual memory space in that scenario the only way of avoiding data collision without writing back to the hard disk is the migration towards super high memory densities
2457418 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2457419 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2457420 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2457433 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2457434 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2457449 our peacekeepers and reinforcement units are currently running an operation to force the georgian side to agree to peace
2457450 they are also responsible for protecting the population thats what we are doing now
2457451 i dont know if all of this will work i have to say that i have to give you straight talk i do

2457462 i was there from a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public
2457463 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness

2457466 i was not at this meeting holding a child for my photograph to be taken i can tell you that
2457467 i have responded to consistently to these tabloid allegations by saying i dont respond to these lies
2457468 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2457469 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2457470 but i would expect that he would not speak or have any role at the convention unless this is cleared up
2457471 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2457472 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2457473 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the first of this campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified at the convention

2457483 the continuation of arrests in the west bank is clearly showing that president mahmoud abbas is not interested in launching a comprehensive national dialogue to end the current crisis

2457506 this is a dominant issue in voting for catholics because of the balance of the supreme court the other issues are also important when you start thinking about the conditions in the iraq war that was a concern for catholics earlier its becoming less so so voters are turning to other more domestic concerns

2457550 they had a great season last year and now harry redknapp has brought crouch into the squad the partnership of crouch and defoe will be a handful for anyone now but hopefully we can cope with that

2457562 between october 1990 and april 1994 french army officers were present in all security organs of the country from 1991 until at least december 1993 there was a high number of french military advisors in the national army far gendarmerie police intelligence and other special organs including the presidential guard
2457563 as stated by gen dallaire head of the un peacekeeping mission since there was evidence of french military involvement with the national army immediately before the genocide it logically follows that the french had adequate information that a major massacre was being planned
2457564 france also actively participated in the war and several times fought side by side with the rwandan national army
2457565 some of those who were identified as tutsi were killed and tortured in the presence of members of the french army who also participated in those acts of murder and torture
2457566 the french army trained and assisted in the training of the interahamwe between 1992 and december 1993 in what was regarded as operation noroit the training was conducted in the five military barracks where the french army was residing
2457567 i saw members of the french army training rwandan militias how to use rifles that happened several times but the only time i actually saw it was when some 30 militiamen were trained how to fire in akagera national park
2457568 according to your directive i have the honour to submit to you an electronic filing system where you will easily trace people meant to be investigated
2457569 on april 7 1994 the french ambassador in rwanda together with col jean jacques maurin went to meet col bagosora and asked him to take charge of the situation
2457570 on may 9 1994 gen huchon hosted lt col ephrem rwabalinda adviser to the far chief of staff
2457571 gen huchon promised to provide ammunition in the category of 105mm other types of ammunition as well as communication equipment to facilitate the communication with gen augustin bizimungu far commander in chief
2457572 we were informed on 8 april 1994 that french planes would land the following day around 6 00am actually they arrived at 3 45am cases of ammunition probably five tons were discharged from a plane and were transported by vehicles of the rwandan army to kanombe barrack which was used as the base for the presidential guard
2457573 in may more than one month after the beginning of massacres the french offloaded a cargo plane full of arms in goma the french consul at goma said he was not in a position to intervene since it was a private contract executed before the embargo on rwanda was imposed
2457574 the first objective of this intervention was to divide the country in two starting from kigali to stop the advance of the rpf and to force it to negotiate a power sharing agreement with the genocide government
2457575 they left in place the genocide infrastructure namely road blocks manned by interahamwe they requested interahamwe to continue patrolling the road blocks and kill tutsi moving around
2457576 col sartre organized a public meeting on july 13 1994 at rubengera where he strongly encouraged the population to flee to zaire by promising frances assistance for a speedy armed return to rwanda
2457577 french soldiers accompanied the ex far and interahamwe into zaire where they immediately assisted them in the form of military training arms and ammunition supplies to prepare an armed return
2457578 by deciding to maintain the politicians and administrators in place and collaborate with those who had perpetrated the genocide in the previous two and half months by requesting them or allowing them to continue killing tutsi the french soldiers and their commanders took full control of the genocide project

2457654 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them

2457656 i was excited when i saw our blue flag being waved in the stadium
2457657 even though we are in anarchy for a few hours yesterday we were no different than developed countries like the united states spain germany or canada
2457658 it reminded me of our heyday before the civil war
2457659 we were watching the opening carnival with great interest but we switched it off when we heard the gunfire
2457660 the main stadium there is now a military base so we trained on the highways and at the smaller banadir stadium
2457661 sometimes the violence stopped us from attending training but we are determined to do well
2457662 its the best name we could get because of its speed and power
2457663 many here are poor and cannot afford to install a satellite dish to watch the olympics
2457664 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook
2457665 enterprises need to have a presence on the web and they want to be relevant
2457666 but stories like this signal the need for sites like facebook and myspace to filter and be more proactive
2457667 this happens every time some cool new technology comes along that attracts a lot of users
2457668 weve seen it with e mail and instant messaging their popularity makes them a become a big target for the bad guys
2457669 the more reports we get the easier it is to respond decisively
2457670 its not that obama is trailing its that his lead is deemed too slight journalists everywhere are asking in a perfect environment for democrats why isnt he running away with this thing and the answer according to the usual strategists and pontificators named and unnamed is that barack has to start punching harder
2457671 it seems not to have occurred to these folks that obama has done pretty well by preaching a different kind of politics there could be a significant downside to the illinois senator getting down in the trenches and engaging in the kind of tit for tat charges that he has criticized
2457672 but he has a certain style of counterpunching gently mocking his opponents often with a smile that so far at least has worked for him
2457673 whether that approach can carry him through september and october is another question but a high minded candidate has to be careful about the low road mccain is drawing criticism for his negative ads and rather lose a war line of assault but thats a risk the republicans team has decided its willing to take
2457674 the overriding truth of the energy debate is that the u s cannot confront the intertwined problems of foreign oil dependence and climate change if we limit our responses to the solutions acceptable to just democrats or just republicans only by combining the two parties priorities can we make progress commensurate with the scale of the challenge
2457675 has entirely broken from their parties prejudices mccain still tilts his emphasis far more toward increased production particularly of oil and nuclear energy than conservation or encouraging renewable sources obama still stresses alternative sources and conservation
2457676 converging and diverging at different points mccain and obama present a complex picture on energy
2457677 the election result still will tilt the needle on any eventual agreement both parties may be moving toward on an all hands on deck energy strategy but they still differ on who should be steering the boat
2457678 become one of the senates most knowledgeabe and trusted voices on military and national security affairs as chairman of the senate armed services committee he commands respect from both the military brass and his republican senate colleagues
2457679 if we havent heard about levin by now were not going to see him on the ticket
2457680 its within the power of our officiating team to take measures in case the situation is reaching an unacceptable level
2457681 the conditions are not the best but our players are very strong what is important is the health of the player
2457682 the position now is that the health of the players is not at risk but each sport has some flexibility by the ioc
2457683 this is the hottest weather i think ive ever experienced
2457684 many fail to grasp whats right in the palm of their hands
2457685 to really enjoy life one must enjoy the journey as well
2457686 in quality there is no status quo you are either getting better or are getting worse so plan for better
2457687 leaders politicians and media will wake up and choose to talk more about good things in life
2457688 i took a view that china was going to be a world power
2457689 my kids started learning mandarin when they were four years old
2457690 when i went to taiwan 20 years ago and opened offices there i was impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit of the chinese people when they werent shackled
2457691 then in 2001 i travelled again over their major mainland industrial areas and noted that the taiwanese free spirit of business was spreading all through china
2457692 i dont see a revolution coming in china any more than in the united states
2457693 chinese people want change but not the radical change that western commentators imagine
2457694 the economic elite has either come out of the party elite or its been absorbed into it
2457695 otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
2457696 in the 1960s people werent necessarily convinced they were just terrorised into submission
2457697 now they stress management rather than control because they understand that persuasion is more effective than force
2457698 it does help explain the resilience of communist party rule despite the fissures in society and the corruption of much of officialdom
2457699 in the chinese cultural context a regimes legitimacy is conferred largely by its ability to mobilise this bureaucratic tradition
2457700 that is one of those real tipping points because that is something which they themselves whatever the rest of us think see as a fundamental core national interest
2457701 which doesnt mean necessarily that they will go to using that approach to their overall global engagements theyre going to need the rest of us for such a long time theres still so much that they cant do
2457702 theres no doubt that china saw the games as a sign of their international acceptance and its a good thing that they want it
2457703 in short to use an english expression they should take it easy
2457704 ours is a nationalist party and our contribution in this regard is known to the people of maharashtra hence supporting such maoists is not possible in this regard we do not believe any such narco test
2457705 additional engineering changes for the entire class are planned to be carried out as the boats are being optimised for local conditions
2457706 we want to ask the private sector to recruit and train their own people and to stop poaching ours
2457707 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and actions
2457708 sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2457709 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2457710 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
2457711 my thoughts and prayers are with the edwards family and thats all i have to say
2457712 twenty taliban were killed and 14 others were wounded in both ground and air raids

2457720 the group of ministers gom constituted to oversee the matters related to the 1984 gas leak disaster has decided that an empowered commission will be set up
2457721 it the letter says that the minister can reach beijing only after aug 10 and he has to make his own arrangements for stay and travel to various locations where the event will take place
2457722 after going through the letter received last night from the external affairs ministry one realises this is not a permission but only a no objection and with this how can one go
2457723 if a ministers visit is set aside on technical grounds does it amount to an insult it appears strange and people of kerala know how the manmohan singh government has taken care of the states needs

2457756 he does it because hes in pain from the injuries he got as a prisoner of war his hands hurt constantly so he rubs them together
2457757 unser ziel war es einen film zu produzieren der anders sein sollte als alles was es im trick und animationsbereich bisher gegeben hatte
2457758 george wollte da die figuren ein eigenleben entfalten unabh ngig von den schauspielern die sie in den filmen verk rpert hatten
2457759 um das zu erreichen mu ten wir die essenz den kern der figuren finden und sie so zum leben erwecken da wir mehr erhalten w rden als eine blo e reproduktion ihrer filmischen gegenst cke
2457760 wir mochten den stil der miniserie clone wars zu der es dann lizensierte statuetten gab das war ein sch ner vorausblick auf die m gliche dreidimensionalit t dieser entw rfe
2457761 aber wir wollten an diesem punkt nicht stehenbleiben sondern weiter gehen und etwas essentiell anderes mit krieg der sterne und der animationskunst anstellen mit dem computer nahmen wir diese stilistischen aspekte auf und berf hrten sie in eine welt mit einer v llig anderen tiefe und k rperlichkeit und einem anderen umfang von diesem ausgangspunkt an entwickelte sich das projekt und wuchs in das was man auf der leinwand sieht
2457762 ich war schon immer ein gro er fan des anime stils die japanische trickkunst und manga neigen dazu mit wirklich innovativen kompositionen grenzen zu sprengen also sind wir diesem vorbild gefolgt
2457763 gleichzeitig ist die trickkunst ein weites feld das uns zu viele m glichkeiten bietet um uns auf einen stil zu begrenzen also haben wir uns auch von gerry andersons thunderbirds inspirieren lassen einer englischen science fiction marionettenserie aus den 1960ern diese verschiedenartigen einfl sse haben wir geb ndelt und in etwas einzigartigem vereint
2457764 in star wars the clone wars haben wir neue figuren planeten fahrzeuge schlachten und ein neue geschichte und das alles in einem v llig neuen animationsstil
2457765 dies ist ein krieg der sterne den ihr nie zuvor gesehen habt und das auf jede erdenkliche weise
2457766 dieses m dchen wurde dann in zwillinge aufgeteilt also blieb beim m dchen eigentlich alles beim alten w hrend luke als neuzugang dazukam denn wenn man es sich recht berlegt erz hlt episode iv eigentlich die geschichte von prinzessin leia um sie geht es um sie dreht sich die ganze handlung sie hat die mission sie ist die anf hrerin ihres volkes die hilfe braucht um all diese dinge zu erledigen die geschichte wird aber aus lukes sicht erz hlt weil er letzten endes seinem vater gegen bertreten mu aber sie hat an die tradition ihrer familie angekn pft
2457767 die wenn man sich an padm und ihre rolle erinnert die einer k nigin war eines anf hrers sie hat die anderen motiviert sie findet anakin und damit f llt padm und leia die rolle des anstifters und ausl sers zu auch wenn die geschichte dann aus anakins und lukes sicht erz hlt wird zwar wird anakins fall zur dunklen seite und lukes erl sungsakt zum dramatischen kern der handlung aber die gro e basis dieser geschichte sind padm und leia sie m ssen die politischen probleme l sen also die rebellion anzuf hren der galaxis die freiheit zu bringen und solche dinge all das machen sie
2457768 nein hier besteht ihre aufgabe darin anakin etwas ruhiger zu machen damit er erwachsener wird um anakin zu einem partner von obi wan zu machen und die beiden damit zu einem team gab es zwei m glichkeiten entweder mu te er vater oder lehrer werden um verantwortungsvoller zu werden und so kommt ahsoka ins spiel und als wir nach jemandem f r die rolle suchten stellte sich heraus da shaak ti jedermanns lieblingsfigur war mit ihr hatten wir nie etwas anfangen k nnen weil sie aus den filmen herausgeschnitten worden war sie spukt noch durch den hintergrund aber der gedanke einer jungen variante von shaak ti gefiel mir f r eine figur also ist ahsoka das ergebnis vieler konzepte
2457769 die vorstellung eines meisters und seines sch lers war schon immer ein wichtiges motiv
2457770 im ersten krieg der sterne film haben wir obi wan kenobi und luke skywalker gesehen es ist nur nat rlich zu sagen da anakin als jedi ritter einen sch ler unterweisen mu da das die wichtigste aufgabe eines jedis ist wer also ist anakins sch ler george wollte dieses r tsel endlich in the clone wars l ften und hier haben wir ahsoka nat rlich fragen sich die fans sofort was mit ihr passiert ist da sie nicht in die rache der sith auftaucht wir werden diese frage beantworten wenn die zeit reif ist aber bis dahin werden wir ihre geschichte erz hlen sch n daran ist da wir viel ber anakin erfahren wenn wir etwas ber ahsoka erfahren sie wird anakins zwischenmenschliche probleme seine abh ngigkeit von anderen personen die ihn zu darth vader machen wird in frage stellen
2457771 ventress basiert auf einem fr hen konzeptbild f r angriff der klonkrieger es gab damals die idee da der sith sch ler nach maul ein m dchen sein k nnte stattdessen wurde dann dooku christopher lees figur eingef hrt aber die konzeptzeichnung existierte und wurde in den comics und romanen zu den klonkriegen benutzt um diese neue figur asajj ventress zu schaffen als die zeit kam die klonkriege als serie zu entwickeln dachten wir sie ist ein fanliebling also nehmen wir sie doch zur gleichen zeit f hrten wir dann ahsoka ein also gab es pl tzlich gleichzeitig diese beiden m dchen und das war ein echter vorteil das eine ist die sch lerin anakin skywalkers der versucht sie in den berlieferten wegen der jedi zu unterweisen das andere die geheime sch lerin dookus das b se spiegelbild und das funktioniert f r die geschichten die wir erz hlen wollen wirklich hervorragend
2457772 wir setzen die macht in the clone wars mit bedacht ein
2457773 selbst der satz m ge die macht mit dir sein ist etwas das ich nur sehr vorsichtig verwende und das liegt an george ich glaube im kinofilm kommt er gar nicht vor und in der serie auch nur sehr selten wenn man so etwas zu h ufig verwendet verliert es den reiz des besonderen au erdem gibt es nicht notwendigerweise neue f higkeiten
2457774 ich erfinde nicht gerne neue kr fte f r superhelden dadurch k nnen wir der macht den wesenszug des geheimnisvollen erhalten und ich denke das ist sehr wichtig
2457775 wir haben versucht einen neuen sound zu schaffen der gleichzeitig die ganzheitlichkeit von john williams bekannter originalmusik aufrechterh lt
2457776 wir wollten aber da der film und die serie eine eigene musikalische identit t bekommen damit die zuschauer wenn sie die musik h ren sofort erkennen k nnen da sie aus
2457777 als ich mir berlegte wie die schaupl tze von the clone wars aussehen sollten die hintergr nde geb ude fahrzeuge habe ich mir ralph mcquarries konzeptbilder angesehen
2457778 wenn man es mit einem etablierten bekannten universum zu tun hat sollte man sich wirklich dessen anf nge ansehen die elemente die es gro gemacht haben ich glaube da mcquarrie john mollo joe johnston und die gestalter des ersten kriegs der sterne eine sthetik entwickelt haben die jeden angesprochen hat diese elemente wollte ich in the clone wars hineintragen und sie in einer zeitperiode am leben erhalten welche doug chiang f r den look der prequels entwickelt hatte the clone wars ist also eine mischung aus beiden aber ralphs bilder sind sehr inspirierend weil sie handgemalt sind man sieht die pinselstriche auf den figuren die geb uden und den fahrzeugen und dieser stil hat uns sehr inspiriert
2457779 f r george und unsere mitarbeiter ist es wichtig da wir uns st ndig neu herausfordern da wir uns immer h here ziele setzen und da sowohl der film als auch die serie ein gef hl epischer gr e vermitteln
2457780 um krieg der sterne gerecht zu werden m ssen die die vielschichtigkeit und komplexit t beibehalten die man von einem visuellen standpunkt aus beobachten kann gleichzeitig aber auch geschichten schreiben die f r eine gro e bandbreite an zuschauern interessant und mitrei end sind da dies ein kinofilm war haben wir jede zur ckhaltung ber bord geworfen um sicherzugehen da die erwartungen die alle an krieg der sterne stellen auch erf llt werden
2457781 nachdem der arbeitsproze jetzt etabliert ist und wir einen fundus besitzen den wir wiederverwenden k nnen sowie jede menge material k nnen wir den einsatz erh hen und damit jede folge der fernsehserie zu einem kleinen kinofilm machen
2457782 der film beginnt und die galaxis versucht mit all diesen schlachten klarzukommen die in den u eren randgebieten ausbrechen
2457783 die jedi versuchen berall zu helfen und sind an vielen verschiedenen fronten im einsatz die republik war auf den krieg nicht vorbereitet aber dooku schon also hat er seine truppen weit verteilt und er kann in viel k rzerer zeit auch viel mehr kampfdroiden produzieren als die republik klone au erdem haben die jedi probleme damit ihre truppen zu bewegen wir versuchen den klonkriegen im weltraum grenzen zu setzen damit es mehr wirkt wie europa im zweiten weltkrieg wo es echte frontlinien gibt es gibt probleme leute durch diese hyperraumrouten zu schleusen
2457784 mitten in diesem schlamassel treffen wir anakin und obi wan die ohne vorr te in dieser riesigen schlacht stecken und alles was man ihnen zur unterst tzung schickt ist dieses junge m dchen
2457785 ahsokas auftritt thematisiert eine der fragen die ich mir immer gestellt habe n mlich wie naiv ist der jedi rat in bezug auf anakins probleme ich glaube da ahsoka anakins fragen beantwortet der rat ist sich zumindest seiner probleme im umgang mit zwischenmenschlichen bindungen bewu t
2457786 ahsoka bietet die m glichkeit anakins beziehungsprobleme n her zu untersuchen wird er diese sch lerin ausbilden will er sie ausbilden welche lehren gibt er weiter wie lehrt er ahsoka wie geht er damit um wenn sie lter und erwachsener wird erkennt er da sie auf sich selbst aufpassen kann da ein meister einen sch ler loslassen mu um ihn wirklich zu unterweisen
2457787 ich finde es toll und bin immer wieder berrascht da wir eine solche vielzahl an unterschiedlichen geschichten erz hlen k nnen
2457788 man f ngt an an krieg der sterne zu arbeiten und glaubt es geht nur um eins wird dieser luke skywalker der dunklen seite verfallen oder auch anakin skywalker wird er fallen aber man kann nicht st ndig geschichten ber leute erz hlen die der dunklen seite erliegen wenn jeder jedi st ndig in gefahr w re der dunklen seite zu verfallen sollte man sie vermutlich besser alle erschie en also findet man heraus da einige von ihnen wirklich gute edle menschen sind und gar nicht die absicht haben sich mit der dunklen seite einzulassen und das f hrt einen dann zu anderen geschichten ber sie wir erz hlen geschichten ber den senat oder die liebe wir lassen uns von den verschiedensten filmen und geschichten inspirieren und die haben mit der macht nicht viel zu tun wir haben angefangen gute packende geschichten zu erz hlen die eben einfach nicht in einem auto ablaufen sondern in einem landgleiter und das ist dann eben die szenerie krieg der sterne eignet sich toll als spielwiese um absurde und kreative dinge anzustellen das ist das tolle wenn man jenseits der klassischen skywalker geschichte arbeitet
2457789 nun ich glaube die serie wird damit berraschen wie viele verschiedene arten von geschichten es in krieg der sterne gibt
2457790 es geht nicht nur um explosionen und puff puff sondern es gibt andere geschichten wir werden unsere zuschauer daran erinnern da die szene in der leia sagt ich liebe dich und han antwortet ich wei einer der gr ten momente in krieg der sterne war und nichts explodierte und ich glaube der film wird die leute damit begeistern da viele viele dinge explodieren und es eine menge schneller actionszenen gibt wir beginnen in dieser gro en tradition des kriegs der sterne mit schnellen actionszenen und gro er intensit t und dann arbeiten wir uns von dort zu einem ganzen haufen verschiedener geschichten vor

2457818 everyone she came across just absolutely fell in love with her
2457819 she was one of those girls who just touched your heart
2457820 there are a lot of rumours going around but the police will get to the bottom of it and in the meantime we just have to be strong for nelly
2457821 we cant point our finger at anyone even though id like to
2457822 but why was she there why was she left there
2457823 what threw us was when we found out where she was actually found
2457824 i think thats the hardest part and thats why we cant really rest until we actually know what happened
2457825 a lot of us think that her drink might have been spiked
2457826 she was already on medicationand i know she wasnt well on the thursday
2457827 im just holding on hoping it will turn out to be natural causes
2457828 if we find out it was an epileptic fit and it was just one of those things that went wrong well id rather that than find out in six or 12 months time that her drink had been spiked
2457829 when i found out i didnt want to believe it was her it still feels like oh shell call me its so unfair
2457830 you just think of all the evil out there and all the wrongdoers and they take someone as beautiful and innocent as nelly who didnt have the chance to have children or grow up
2457831 she spoke to me several hours beforehand and said mum i really dont want to go
2457832 she was rushing back home to get ready and she had other plans romantic plans and she really didnt feel like going but i guess she felt obliged
2457833 i just hold on to that maybe if she had stuck to her gut and just stayed at home maybe she would still be here
2457834 there are just so many questions that go around in your head and you try and get the answers but the only answers we are going to get is when the police finish their investigation
2457835 it was her dream job to get into perfumes and make up
2457836 she was a glamour girl absolutely gorgeous and she finally got that chance shed been waiting for
2457837 so now i think is that the way the world is
2457838 they give you what you want and then they take it away
2457839 im trying to be strong for nelly but im angry because i dont have any answers
2457840 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
2457841 the main point for us is that the rule of law needs to stand above politics

2457860 lo que yo quiero indicar es que hay un apoyo total de todos los presidentes de todos los gobiernos de la regi n a este proceso democr tico y a la institucionalidad democr tica
2457861 un hombre que anda entre las drogas y el alcohol no puede tener el raciocinio exacto de lo que es bolivia la realidad pol tica qu se puede esperar de este personaje pol tico ste se or cuando aterriza y est sobrio puede ser un alcalde pero estoy seguro que detr s de todo esto est la mano de gonzalo s nchez de lozada
2457862 insistimos en nuestra exhortaci n al gobierno los prefectos l deres pol ticos agrupaciones ciudadanas partidos dirigentes c vicos sindicalistas organizaciones sociales bolivianos y bolivianas para que hagan causa com n para llevar adelante el referendo revocatorio en paz social este domingo

2457864 nunca en la historia de los ltimos 50 a os del pa s las fuerzas armadas han estado tan fuertemente vinculadas con la estrategia del gobierno democr tico de evo morales
2457865 hoy en d a la posibilidad menos viable en bolivia es un golpe de estado ning n militar se va a atrever a hacerlo con el ejemplo justamente de garc a meza el ltimo golpista est en chonchocoro y quien lo acompa est a punto de llegar a bolivia porque una jueza en estado unidos denise s slavin rechaz un recurso para impedir su deportaci n
2457866 los bolivianos deben hacer uso de su derecho pol tico ciudadano de participar y decidir en las urnas con su voto lo que piensa si est a favor del gobierno o en contra pero que lo haga en las urnas y no en las calles peor usando la violencia

2457872 hacemos un pedido al pueblo boliviano para que recapacite y valore por lo que hizo el presidente evo morales y decida con su voto por la continuidad del proceso

2457892 how many things can you find wrong with this old magazine ad
2457893 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2457894 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2457895 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2457896 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2457897 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2457898 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2457899 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2457900 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2457901 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2457902 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2457903 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2457904 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2457905 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2457906 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2457907 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2457908 were actively following the situation right now and u s embassy officials are already at the hospital
2457909 starting the season with a new technical adviser is a good thing we are hopeful to have a good season and playing our first game away is good for us because it will enable us test our strength away when you start away whatever lesson and experience learnt helps a great deal for the season
2457910 we have tasked him to win the challenge cup and the league we have a challenge cup silver ware and want to win it again including winning what we have not won before the league
2457911 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all of the stages that i have to become a u s citizen
2457912 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american seeing my fellow americans coming behind me in the opening ceremony and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor
2457913 in many ways the opening ceremony sets the tone for the two weeks of competition and celebration that will follow
2457914 100 years of olympic football have produced many unforgettable encounters
2457915 africas first olympic football gold is sealed in dramatic fashion nigeria are two goals down with 12 minutes remaining of their semi final against brazil but manage to level the scores at 3 3 and go on to win through a golden goal by nwankwo kanu after only four minutes of extra time
2457916 they repeat their exploits in the final overhauling a 2 1 deficit against favourites argentina
2457917 once again an african team reaches the final cameroons fate seems sealed early on when xavi scores after two minutes and spain lead 2 0 at half time however an own goal by amayas and a strike by etoo on the hour mark put cameroon back on level terms spain survive extra time despite playing with only nine men but lose on penalties the hero in front of 100 000 spectators in stadium australia is cameroons 16 year old goalkeeper carlos kameni
2457918 italys olympic team starring carnevale ferrara and tassotti do not know quite what has hit then four bwalya goals 3 from kalusha 1 from joson constitute a debacle for the azurri who nevertheless go on to qualify zambia later lose to fr germany in the quarter final several of the zambian players go on to lose their life in 1993 when their plane crashes off the coast of gabon
2457919 budding talents from across the country and even beyond ikeoha babes will in the interim compete at the youth level we would concern ourselves with discovering talents at the local levels and register our identity in the map of youth football in nigeria
2457920 the game against germany will be different korea was our first game the two games against germany and brazil will be difficult no doubt but we will improve with the games at hand the loss against korea was just a temporary setback although we are at the bottom of the group at the moment we are by no means out of it

2457936 stim ca e un meci important diferit de celelalte dar ne asteptam sa obtinem un rezultat bun obiectivul tuturor e sa intram pe teren si sa castigam cu ajutorul galeriei sper sa iesim victoriosi m am gandit ca poate o sa am norocul sa marchez din nou dar conteaza sa castigam nu sa inscriu eu exista rivalitate pentru ca se bat doua echipe care vor campionatul si sa ajunga in liga campionilor sper ca la final noi sa ne bucuram nu e vorba ca avem cel mai frumos fotbal dar dam totul ca sa realizam ce ne a spus antrenorul
2457937 va fi un meci greu impotriva unei contracandidate la castigarea campionatului meci in care noi vom cauta sa demonstram ca suntem intr o forma buna totusi cred ca va fi un meci frumos pe care sper sa l castigam intalnim un rapid schimbat cu 8 straini in formula de start cu un nou antrenor si cu o posesie foarte buna a balonului tactica noastra pentru acest meci se va baza pe o organizare fara greseala in defensiva sa riscam cat mai putin dar totusi sa reusim sa inscriem
2457938 indiferent cine joaca trebuie sa ne aparam blazonul sintem campionii si trebuie sa cistigam in giulesti vom juca fotbal asta e sigur

2458010 dit jaar niet meer buiten maar dat was ook niet ideaal met de muziek zo dichtbij
2458011 naast de klassiekers wil ik wil films die maximaal een half jaar oud zijn rond januari februari let ik extra op bij alle nieuwe releases dan zie je iets moois maar voel ik meteen nee dit is geen lowlandsfilm wat dat is ik weet het niet dat is zo gegroeid
2458012 anything goes wat betreft de moeilijkheidsgraad en het onderwerp natuurlijk moet je niet op zondag om acht uur s avonds het allerzwaarste programmeren tegen die tijd zorg ik dat er films draaien waar je gegarandeerd bij wakker blijft
2458013 helaas lukt dat niet als ze nog in de bioscoop draaien dat is overigens niet altijd zo ook dit jaar hebben we weer een flink aantal voorpremi res op het programma staan
2458014 dat is vaak nog lang niet compleet wanneer ik beslissingen moet maken daarnaast is dit natuurlijk een heel ander onderdeel
2458015 ik bekeek hem laatst weer wat is dat eigenlijk een slechte film hij is zo gedateerd dan kies ik toch liever een echte klassieker die nu ook nog geweldig is
2458016 er was toen nog geen beveiliging en de opkomst was gigantisch
2458017 zon 4000 man die helemaal opgaan in het moment ik klom ergens hoog in om het te zien prachtig
2458018 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film
2458019 my challenge this season is not only to stay fit but to make my way into the team again
2458020 thats going to be difficult because of the way wes performed and also
2458021 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic but i have never been afraid of a challenge and i dont see it as a pressure or a burden it is exciting and a fantastic incentive
2458022 winning the fa cup was a great achievement and they can only push on from there you really are talking about a side with great strength and ability
2458023 portsmouth are very difficult to beat with their physical strength and mixed in with that they have some hugely skilful players
2458024 the au will suspend mauritanias membership until the country returns to constitutional government
2458025 the coup is a serious setback for mauritanians because it has robbed the people of their basic right to freely elect leaders of their own choice

2458104 let us all clearly remember that by the serious nature of our presidents illness the healing process will indeed be long
2458105 on july 2 a series of tests were carried out at percy military hospital and following this a decision was made that the operation conducted at the sharm el sheik hospital in egypt had been adequate and there was no need for another operation
2458106 they advised that to fully access his medical condition the treatment and care plan that they had put in place needed to be continued and that the process called for patience on the part of all concerned
2458107 the appeal of the government is that the president will continue to receive the medical attention that is presently being accorded to him so far this treatment and care is working as evidenced by the gradual and continued improvement
2458108 the government spokesperson is here and he would do everything possible to ensure that the citizens are informed
2458109 in 2006 heb ik een ernstige inschattingsfout gemaakt en heb ik mijzelf gedragen op een wijze die niet oprecht is tegenover mijn gezin en mijn belangrijkste principes

2458111 als we in dit tempo doorgaan kunnen we over drie jaar 3391 megawatt opwekken dat is zeshonderd megawatt te weinig en dus moeten we proberen de knelpunten bij de geplande aanleg weg te nemen sommige problemen zullen goed op te lossen zijn andere wat moeilijker

2458137 all of us are getting together to go down and make a change
2458138 attitudes towards spanking and bondage are changing it seems that people particularly those living in cities and urban areas are becoming far more open to alternative sexual behaviour
2458139 phone sex is actually a pretty safe activity you cant get pregnant and you cant get an sti a lot of loving couples use phone sex when they are apart but naturally they get close up and personal again as soon as they are together again
2458140 what i dont understand is all this fuss over netscape removing the dtd a well designed rss tool whether it validates or not would not use the dtd at netscapes site in any case there are several mechanisms which can be used to control the dereferencing of references from xml documents to their dtds these should be used if not the result will be as described in the article
2458141 we are very pleased as a company obviously it goes a way towards the governments renewable targets and our own renewable targets
2458142 we are now looking forward to working with the mod to try and find a mitigation or a solution
2458143 air defence radar is essential to the defence of the country
2458144 we will need to be satisfied that the impact of any proposed wind farm does not compromise our national security
2458145 the mod is committed to government targets for renewable energy and whenever possible we seek to work with wind farm developers to find a mutually acceptable solution
2458146 this wind farm is not approved they cannot do anything with it until they have sorted out the brizlee radar problem

2458158 dos familiares de un entrenador del equipo masculino estadounidense de voleibol
2458159 nuestra prioridad a esta hora es atender las necesidades de los familiares del equipo masculino de voleibol y de la delegaci n estadounidense entera
2458160 por respeto a las v ctimas y a su familia no daremos m s informaciones la embajada americana est cooperando activamente con las autoridades chinas para resolver este crimen lo m s r pidamente posible
2458161 i met a man on the bus today i shook his hand hell never see his family again
2458162 and as such we rallied around each other for support
2458163 we really were surprised at the level of trust we found
2458164 the question is what is the next step to be taken
2458165 we can focus on the general land office and the absence of an effective coastal management program in texas theres no doubt that under federal law texas is required to have a program that regulates the citing of electrical generation capacity within the coastal zone we dont think theres effective protection of the texas coast and the wind farms are one example
2458166 thats what theyve contended and we disagree the land office has not failed to do anything
2458167 what were trying to do is encourage the growth of wind energy in texas because it makes sense
2458168 we still believe theyre located in an area that will do great harm to migratory birds
2458169 will set the standard for the rest of the country as far as an environmentally sensitive approach
2458170 i think renewable and none depleting energy is the way of the future
2458171 we personally believe wind energy is by far the most benign energy source compared to coal fired or nuclear energy
2458172 who me help you talk to females sod that mate im off
2458173 it the show is a way for me to celebrate her memory
2458174 she vasile was like a second mother to everyone in my neighborhood
2458175 so claiming that they will have this built in 2009 in very positive i think its highly premature and not at all true time will tell
2458176 obama and his wife are never going to make it to the white house he needs to be taken out and i can do it in a heartbeat
2458177 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2458178 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2458179 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2458180 in de commercial opent barack obama ook de aanval op zijn rivaal john mccain
2458181 hij suggereert dat een keuze op mccain betekent dat er opnieuw een marionet van de oliemaatschappijen in het witte huis komt met een verwijzing naar shell sprak obama in een speech over de shell game verwijzend naar een spelletje waarbij deelnemers worden opgelicht
2458182 have you ever seen gilmore girls they live in this really small town a homey one thats kind of what i was expecting but this was even more rural it was a very small and very spread out place theres only one intersection in town
2458183 we actually stayed in the cullen house its technically not i dont think stephenie meyer ever went to the town till after the book came out but for the most part it looked like it the essence
2458184 the house that bella lived in the designated houses kitchen actually has yellow cupboards in the kitchen which bellas house had we didnt get to go inside its someones house but thats what the innkeeper told us
2458185 we went to bellas house the hospital carlisle cullen works at and the forks outfitters where bella works
2458186 and its really beautiful and its where they fought victoria and all the newborns vampires
2458187 i think la push and the rain forest were my favorite its so beautiful there are islands that stick up out of the water really really pretty
2458188 she liked to tell stories it was probably better than the van tours definitely
2458189 achter de kassa van een supermarkt ligt het misschien wat lastiger
2458190 onze lezeressen zijn echter hoogopgeleid in een setting van zakenreizen en recepties valt daar al meer bij voor te stellen
2458191 heute sieht s mit der thermik nicht so gut aus wir m ssen schauen ob wir welche erwischen
2458192 als flugsch ler entfernt man sich alleine sowieso nicht mehr als 300 meter vom startplatz denn je nach wetter kann es beim segelfliegen sonst eben immer passieren dass man nicht wieder zur ckkommt und der flieger abgeholt werden muss
2458193 wenn man das wirklich will dann kann man es sich auch leisten neben dem monats und jahresbeitrag zahlt man pro flugminute zehn cent das finde ich angemessen
2458194 segelfliegen ist ein richtiger teamsport alleine kann man das vergessen
2458195 this is an important milestone that has been registered in the interparty dialogue
2458196 imagine trucks hauling the nations nuclear waste on our highways to yucca mountain john mccain supports opening yucca hes not worried about nuclear waste in our state only in arizona
2458197 would you be comfortable with nuclear waste coming through arizona on its way you know going through phoenix on its way to yucca mountain
2458198 john mccain for nuclear waste in nevada just not in his backyard barack obama opposes opening yucca hell protect our families
2458199 what people forget is the option of leaving this waste in areas outside maybe unprotected certainly not well protected all over america rather than having it in a safe and secure repository for it
2458200 i preferred not having the status quo and i think it is a national security issue
2458201 my mother died and that was 20 years ago thats what matters to you
2458202 she was alive one day and dead the next thats the worst thing thats ever happened to me this is not really up there with that
2458203 you are in this game to win when the players and fans suffer disappointment you suffer along with them
2458204 i still feel it as much as it did when it happened 15 or 20 years ago that never goes away from you if you are competitive then thats what happens to you
2458205 managers always take the responsibility for it thats a managers job and what he does
2458206 we will just get up and get on with it to make sure we dont let it cause us a problem starting on sunday at falkirk
2458207 thats something we have to bear in mind more than anything else people can criticise managers players or whoever but now we have to make sure it doesnt create a more upsetting circumstance
2458208 none of the players playing for rangers right now have let anyone down
2458209 yes losing the european games was a big disappointment to everybody but if you take into consideration our overall achievements coming from where we were 18 months ago to where we are now then i dont think anybody can say theyve let anybody down
2458210 the players havent let anyone down everybody felt let down the other night the players the staff ourselves and we all take responsibility for that
2458211 but overall the vast majority of players in the group have handled playing for the club extremely well
2458212 i think the players that we have got coped quite well last season there is no reason to suppose that the players are now going to struggle simply because of one or two bad results
2458213 they showed last season they can handle that but like every other player and every other manager we now need to go out and do it again
2458214 it is true to say that i have had a meeting with arsene wenger
2458215 hemos conseguido llegar al fondo de uno de los problemas
2458216 tenemos una explicaci n especialmente cuando consideras que en el invierno est bamos al nivel de red bull y toyota y ahora hemos empeorado
2458217 sabemos en qu rea fallamos y de hecho aprend mucho en hungr a all probamos algo distinto para ver si nos daba una idea de lo que era correcto lo prob en calificaci n y es positivo
2458218 i forget the real place when i take this picture
2458219 therefore he had been sleeping since his teacher started the class
2458220 vivimos revolcaos en un merengue y en un mismo lodo todos manoseaos
2458221 el mundo fue y ser una porquer a ya lo s en el quinientos seis y en el dos mil tambi n
2458222 yes i had a tom mann worm and a flasher the kids of today dont realize how good they have it what with all of the products lines gpss rods and reels plus thousands of lures to choose from
2458223 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2458224 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2458225 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2458226 preseason is really important to me like all these guys
2458227 were working hard and this is where you get better
2458228 we will just have to keep working on all the areas that we have identified that need improvement a lot of guys got playing time some guys got quite a bit
2458229 i dont think it is very different than the other positions
2458230 sometimes the player doesnt have the opportunity to be productive on a particular play whether that is because of what the other team is doing or maybe because of another breakdown
2458231 then there are other times when he does in the end the bottom line is how do you feel the players production on any given play is rated toward the potential or what he could have done or he should have been able to do in that particular situation
2458232 im sure the next time he gets an opportunity to play he will try to take some of the experiences he had last night and build off those
2458233 i think every day is important whether its a game or practice or a meeting
2458234 its definitely a new experience but i was prepared to play well by the coaches
2458235 weve been sitting down and talking about it for a few days and we dont have a conclusion yet
2458236 one day we need one thing and the next day we need another thing
2458237 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2458238 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2458239 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2458240 i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go
2458241 ive had a couple of dings this year but ive been able to take some days off i know i have a few years left hopefully it is with san diego
2458242 when i hit my driver like i did today this is an easy sport
2458243 its the kind of round ive been looking for to get myself back on the leaderboard and feeling the good vibes
2458244 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2458245 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2458246 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2458247 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2458248 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2458249 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2458250 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2458251 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2458252 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground
2458253 the lineups are deeper and the pitching will be just as good as what theyre sending out there but i do think they have a chance to make some noise
2458254 timmy welch is a really good pitcher and brad monroe has proven to be a big game pitcher as well at least for the first two games theyll be in a position to win
2458255 this is my fifth year and weve had a lot of success in recent years i think we have a good mix of players this year we have three real good starting pitchers and our offense has been there when we needed it i think weve had to come from behind to win our last three games
2458256 the year we were there new jersey rhode island massachusetts and connecticut seemed to be a notch above the others
2458257 we could have beaten one of those teams but we werent winning that tournament
2458258 the year we went the pitching was a little bit better than what we faced back home but i think portsmouth has a little bit more talent than we did they were the most talented team in our state i think theyll be fine
2458259 the evidence is pretty convincing that the models give a good simulation of climate
2458260 without human skin like sensitivity robots cannot be used in everyday life imagine the danger if a robot did not recognise when it had accidentally bumped into a young child
2458261 in any area where you need electronics that can stretch and bend without compromising performance for example in wearable electronics to monitor movement this is going to be quite a breakthrough
2458262 i first heard about tibet when i was at edinburgh university some of my friends formed a group and i went along to a film screening and a couple of talks
2458263 as i learned more i got more and more involved i felt that my skills as a climber could be used to help
2458264 i practiced climbing up trees at corstorphine hill i spent quite a bit of time up there
2458265 i am over the moon by the support i have got from scotland my actions are a small part of a much larger campaign but i hope that a small difference has been made
2458266 i didnt go there to get arrested but i did realise the risks
2458267 i went to beijing to shine a spotlight on the way the chinese have tried to whitewash the human rights abuses in tibet

2458269 i officially contest the punishment that has been applied on sylvain and i ask that it is lifted immediately
2458270 i appeal to the club to make their position clear as regards sylvain the good relationship i have with president frederic saint sernin and general manager msr pierre dreossi leads me to think that rennes arent looking to part with sylvain by these hare brained ways
2458271 i hope that we can have constructive talks with everyone very soon rennes must accept the consequences of the decision of their coach
2458272 i would like to know what we do now that guy lacombe has acknowledged he wishes to do without the services of sylvain
2458273 i officially contest the punishment that has been applied on sylvain and i ask that it is lifted immediately
2458274 i appeal to the club to make their position clear as regards sylvain the good relationship i have with president frederic saint sernin and general manager msr pierre dreossi leads me to think that rennes arent looking to part with sylvain by these hare brained ways
2458275 i hope that we can have constructive talks with everyone very soon rennes must accept the consequences of the decision of their coach
2458276 i would like to know what we do now that guy lacombe has acknowledged he wishes to do without the services of sylvain
2458277 developing nationals and giving them access to state of the art educational knowledge is a top priority for aldar and an integral part of its social responsibility we do hope this programme will contribute in the most effective way to the process of building the future business leaders for abu dhabi a process that stands at the core of aldar strategy
2458278 for the graduates it is a modular built into their 3 year program aimed at providing graduates with a tool box and motivation to succeed in the work place manage their careers and develop management and leadership capabilities which will fast track their career growth
2458279 we are very pleased to have this opportunity to work with aldar and their graduate and scholarship intake they are the future of the company and indeed the nation we are very privileged to have the partnering agreement with the royal military academy sandhurst which we have had since 2001 sandhurst provides a unique leaning environment and many transferable leadership skills its not about shouting orders but about knowing your people and understanding what makes them tick communicating clearly and effectively and developing a sense of selfless commitment to something larger than ourselves we look forward to working with the aldar graduates and watching them grow as leaders and individuals
2458280 id imagine the winds will make it very difficult to safely control even tethered balloons
2458281 were watching the weather and we wont make a decision until 5pm
2458282 at the moment its just drizzle and its clear so we are reviewing the situation all the time
2458283 all specimens collected from suspect cases have given negative results they are all recovered
2458284 i want such officials to be fired bring them to me and i myself will help the police to arrest them
2458285 this is very dangerous because the explosives are highly flammable and need special packaging
2458286 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
2458287 you never truly understand something until you can explain it to your grandmother
2458288 it makes me wonder how theyll close off these games in two weeks time here are some of my highlights from the opening ceremony the parade of the countries seeing the usa team enter the birds nest

2458291 hear that noise coming from behind my left ear that is the sound of money exploding
2458292 well as propellers programming manager and the one who runs the aforementioned scout team i can say these reports are being blown a little out of proportion we did let a few scouts go but it was 4 out of about 35 so that fraction we were reduced to is roughly 9 10ths
2458293 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
2458294 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2458295 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2458296 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
2458297 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road

2458307 my challenge this season is not only to stay fit but to make my way into the team again
2458308 thats going to be difficult because of the way wes performed and also owen hargreaves and john oshea in the right back position
2458309 the competition for places throughout the team is fantastic but i have never been afraid of a challenge and i dont see it as a pressure or a burden it is exciting and a fantastic incentive
2458310 harry redknapp has done a fantastic job getting the players that he has brought in
2458311 winning the fa cup was a great achievement and they can only push on from there you really are talking about a side with great strength and ability
2458312 portsmouth are very difficult to beat with their physical strength and mixed in with that they have some hugely skilful players
2458313 while at the drum tower in central beijing the two family members were stabbed during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant one of the family members was killed and the other seriously injured
2458314 we need further investigation to find out the motive since the man has killed himself we have no more information to provide for the moment
2458315 were actively following the situation right now and us embassy officials are already at the hospital

2458357 at a time the product was very scarce and costly ambassador pindar brought in several tonnes of fertiliser to us and sold at a cheap price of n2 050 per bag as against the market price of n4 300 per bag
2458358 we wish that others like him who god has blessed could emulate him and make available such farming inputs to us at the appropriate time and affordable prices
2458359 i can assure you that if we the farmers of southern borno state have access to necessary farming inputs and at the right time we will produce enough food that will feed not only our state but the entire country

2458409 he does think we should have a vote on drilling as part of a larger energy policy
2458410 the republicans are doing a disservice to the country by focusing on drilling
2458411 we cant drill our way out of this the sooner we get to alternative energy and raising fuel efficiency standards is when we will start to work our way out of this problem

2458415 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2458416 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2458417 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2458418 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2458419 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2458420 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2458421 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him

2458460 there is money available and would have been even if abdoulaye hadnt made his intentions clear
2458461 but the deal obviously brings more money into the club and we are looking to use that to sign another player
2458462 there is no big rush though id rather take my time and sign the right one
2458463 it was a bit disappointing that we went down to 10 men so early
2458464 but we probably played better a man down than we did with him
2458465 we looked a bit sluggish at the start but these kind of games are just for training purposes they dont have the competitive edge we looked a bit tired in training too but as i said to the players the idea of these sort of run outs is that we dont look sluggish when the season kicks off and im sure we wont
2458466 id like to think ill take another step up this season
2458467 for myself its important that i play football because as part of my learning curve i need to be playing if i dont play im not learning
2458468 obviously i would love to be played in my position which is centre forward
2458469 i really hope the manager sees it that way and not as a winger because a lot of my movement is in and around the box and id like to think im a decent finisher as well
2458470 if ive got a job to do on the wing ill try my best and ill do as much work as i can for the team and manager
2458471 but i see myself as a forward and id love to be in and around the front two
2458472 theres nothing like a bit of competition you cant beat it
2458473 ive got brilliant strikers ahead of me but its all good to work and learn off these people and get better so theres no reason why i cant push on
2458474 ive just got to keep learning and keep my head up
2458475 it was disppointing to lose brad and david becasue they are good lads but theres good lads coming into the club as well
2458476 people move on these things happen in football but at the end of the day youve got to get on with your own job and keep yourself right
2458477 if you do that you dont have to worry about these players because blackburn is a big club and we want to push on

2458491 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2458492 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2458493 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2458494 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2458495 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2458496 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2458497 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2458498 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2458596 children deserve full functioning natural loving dedicated relationships with both of their parents equally in and out of marriage whenever possible
2458597 i dont know what your destiny will be but one thing i do know the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve
2458598 the biovator is an in vessel composter that uses in vessel technology to enhance an age old process of composting
2458599 it speeds up the microorganisms and produces a pathogen free safe compost out of your mortalities in a very short period of time
2458600 the big driver right now is the price of fuel for incineration which a lot of producers are still doing thats really driving those producers to take a look at other alternatives
2458601 we soon found that the cost of incineration along with the air emissions was not something we could afford with diesel fuel approaching 4 50 so we in october of 2007 decided to seek another remedy for our mortalities and thats when we teamed up with biovator and began using the rotary drum composting system to dispose of our mortalities
2458602 during that audit we found several items that we could improve on but the largest one was our mortality removal and the method that we got rid of our mortalities
2458603 the energy audit itself showed that we had a value of about 28 000 to 30 000 a year in savings on diesel fuel alone not to mention the benefits for the environment and the ability to utilize the end product
2458604 we had looked at a number of different ways of composting and this just seemed to me to be a better and easier system to work with
2458605 the composter itself runs approximately 35 000 to 45 000
2458606 the whole composter runs on one one horse power motor so the electricity bills are very very minimal it only runs approximately two hours per day on a one horse power motor so its a matter of pennies per day
2458607 over the years weve handled deadstock on the operation every way conceivable and were always looking for a better way
2458608 the bin composting was far more labour intensive for one
2458609 the single biggest reason was that the bin composting tended to go anaerobic and therefore there was significant odour when we would turn the bins the other thing was in the summer months we ended up in a situation where we had a lot of flies the vessel composting has eliminated those issues and in addition the possibility of animals dogs coyotes or whatever digging into our bin composter and packing stuff off into the fields or the neighbours place
2458610 the beauty of it is the ongoing cost of running a biovator only come in at about 120 per year
2458611 this has become a lower cost option but more importantly to us its just become a much more pleasant operation in dealing with the unpleasant side of livestock production
2458612 if youve ever been to a store and bought potting soil its very similar probably a little more wood chips in it
2458613 nitrogen has become very expensive commercial fertilizers have become so expensive over the last two to three years with the rising cost of fuel its been important to utilize all sources of nitrogen that we can on the farm to produce our small grains and our hay
2458614 while were talking about the compost the composition of it if you have weak land like here in north carolina in certain areas we have sandy land that doesnt do a very good job of holding moisture this compost really builds up the land and the quality of the soil to help it maintain a little more moisture to grow a better crop
2458615 in the future i would expect a large swing over to some form of composting whether it be in vessel or just your standard form just due to the energy crisis i dont see those energy costs coming down any time soon and farmers are going to be watching their dollars a lot closer

2458730 the real estate market across india is witnessing a downturn and the situation is no different in pune either where there has been at least 15 to 20 slowdown a figure equivalent to the all india statistics
2458731 in pune as compared to other cities a large number of bookings that take place are from investors that has slowed down and cancellations too increased from the investors side thereby making it one of the cities with highest number of cancellations
2458732 it cannot be quantified but a lot of cancellations took place not only in the investors but also material side
2458733 several pune based builders have however already started taking steps by not selling properties to investors
2458734 lots of announcements of new properties were made with the it and ites boom but that has not resulted in the equal number of homes being built moreover many people are playing it safe and waiting for the market to change before they invest
2458735 if the situation improves within 18 24 months it is good otherwise it could go worse unlike the earlier slowdown in the 90s the banking system does not have the ability to bail out the industry

2458746 naming a beer is not an easy thing to do and we didnt think it was appropriate for any single person or group to come up with so it just made logical sense to put it in front of the commander and the crew

2458833 hes brilliant i think hes probably one of the best actors ive ever worked with if not the best
2458834 im having this experience of watching him and improvise and take this character which isnt an easy proposition to make this guy relatable and hes just amazing
2458835 i just think its amazing seeing him have the respect and success at this point in his life after everything hes been through he deserves it so i was really excited to work with him
2458836 i felt we had to be really clear about what our point of view was where the humour was coming from with this movie

2458848 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2458849 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2458850 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2458851 we are all feeling the pinch at the moment and this is a good way to help both the environment and the pocket
2458852 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2458853 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2458854 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2458855 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2458856 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2459047 you dont need to put pilots in a vehicle where you are only collecting data providing you can do it safely
2459048 thats going to drive savings in weight which will drive savings in fuel costs so where you see normal routine data gathering operations by manned aviation today i would see that gradually being transferred over to uavs in the next 20 years
2459049 it has a back up so we can take control of the vehicle if we need to and fly it manually
2459050 it tells you the difference between green crops that are photosynthesising and bare ground
2459051 the more dense the crop the less fertiliser you need to apply
2459052 we know you can get good maps of this sort from manned aircraft but its so difficult to get an aircraft to the field you need it in at the time you need it there and its also very expensive
2459053 we can see uavs extending a long way because we know that its useful for monitoring forestry and detecting disease in crops
2459054 we can see quite a sea change in farming to it being based on real measurements rather than being based on some guesswork
2459055 more than half the e government programme has been accomplished so far in coordination with international consultants especially from singapore

2459061 it will be simpler for citizens to communicate within themselves or even with the government agencies the integrated online and service delivery will reduce the cost of interacting with the city and in particular will reduce the paper burden on citizens businesses and organisations including community organisations
2459062 the network is compatible for all digital devices and will help plan the future digitisation of the city
2459063 initially modern cities were known by the transport infrastructure and other basic amenities they provided but now every city is judged by the internet access that citizens can avail of if we have to be on global footing this system will only enhance our chances

2459094 it just sat in our yard all winter and we laughed and giggled and cooked on it
2459095 i bet when we get back to school well probably wish we were out here
2459096 there are just a great bunch of people down here
2459097 i do love my other job and the little kids
2459098 i have people tell me what a great idea this is and that theyre so happy im here
2459099 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
2459100 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
2459101 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth and asked for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness we have kept this within our family since that time
2459102 i grew up as a small town boy in north carolina came from nothing worked very hard dreamed that i could do something helpful for other people with my life became a lawyer through a lot of work and success i got some acclaim as a lawyer
2459103 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
2459104 i was at the beverly hilton i was trying to keep this mistake i made from becoming public
2459105 ive never paid a dime of money never asked anybody to pay a dime of money nothing has been done at my request
2459106 im not sure i had a political career in the future not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

2459109 wards exceptional talent and passion for music will doubtless inspire our youth orchestra and audiences here in st louis
2459110 we are very much looking forward to having him here
2459111 i had the time and the resources and i was lucky enough to have connections through my studies and career to that point to really go after conducting
2459112 i always wanted to conduct before i became an accomplished trombone player
2459113 it was sort of like an extreme a la carte education
2459114 the second year i flew all over europe to take master classes and get on the podium with different orchestras in moscow paris finland germany london and the french alps
2459115 david robertson is the music director and i have tremendous respect for him and the orchestra is a fine orchestra they are at a place in their history where they are really growing and im excited to be a part of it
2459116 hmmm thats a good question let me think about that for a second
2459117 im not really sure im going to have to think about that for a bit and get back to you
2459118 im not sure to be honest what do you think
2459119 ive never really considered that perhaps you can expand the question a little and we can explore it right now
2459120 im not sure how we would deal with a sudden spike in the cost of bandwidth we would have to collect more information and answer that question down the road

2459130 most failed states of africa today can be attributed solely to electoral politics and their attendant crises
2459131 the governor owes me a duty of protecting me against any form of threat the issue of seeking justice at the election petition tribunal is not a personal war but that of the pursuit of political right by the partys candidate of seeking justice over her exclusion from the rerun polls in the state
2459132 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2459133 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2459134 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2459135 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2459136 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2459137 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2459138 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2459139 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2459140 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2459141 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2459142 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2459143 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2459144 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2459145 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2459146 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2459147 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2459148 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2459149 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2459150 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2459151 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2459152 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2459153 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2459154 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2459155 we were in a difficult situation facing a complex building depression whose passage is hard to forecast
2459156 these depressions can generate strong very strong winds from the south west in the st georges channel on the return down from the isle of man and no doubt would have meant finishing the race in ireland i have therefore preferred to set a new course that is long and which is still interesting sports wise and that will also get the skippers into laber wrach before the very strong winds hit even tough we would have preferred to have this long leg one that we have been planning and thinking of doing for a long time you cant go against nature particularly when it comes down to the safety of the competitors we are not here to play circus games it is nature that dictates the law here the leg some 500 miles will still be interesting and with lots options to play with
2459157 with this new course i loose the advantage of sailing in home waters initially it will be tough to sail up to the new buoy then it should be slightly easier this does swing back into the favour of those who sail around there and know the area well
2459158 effectively we will be doing a 500 mile windward leeward race with a spreader mark
2459159 he is such a nice chap that none of us mind
2459160 i have been sailing flying 15s for 25 years i used to race with my dad and now i race with my 11 year old daughter eleanor they are lovely boats and we love being out there you might not think it but it is a very competitive class and some of the younger guys are hopeful that they might topple rupert one day
2459161 it was quite tense because we were in 5th place at the first mark and if we had stayed there we would not have won overall
2459162 we have taken this very seriously we are professional sailors so treated it as part of our training programme and feel that we made a clear progression it has been a fantastic regatta and we are really pleased to have won
2459163 the crew are pretty disappointed but it was all my fault
2459164 my tactician advised me not to put it up because we were in the lead and only needed to stay in front of amey love shack to win the overall prize but i wanted to put it up for a bit of fun
2459165 this was not in the plan at all but it is very exciting
2459166 if they win tomorrow and we come second we win overall if they win and we come third they win overall if we win we win
2459167 the forecast is for wind which suits us because we are the fat boys of the fleet but julia has to be favourite because she is a very good competitor shes clever with a very good crew
2459168 mein ziel war eine medaille deshalb habe ich am schluss alles auf eine karte gesetzt und gehofft dass ich mit einer minute vorsprung in den letzten anstieg komme und mich die italiener und spanier nicht mehr kriegen leider war es zu wenig vorsprung aber ich kann mir nichts vorwerfen ich bin ein beherztes rennen gefahren mit so einer attacke bin ich auch milit rweltmeister geworden ich hatte nur so eine chance auf eine medaille ob ich am ende vierter oder 50 werde ist mir egal
2459169 ein gutes rennen viel hat nicht gefehlt es waren extreme bedingungen wir haben uns beide gut gezeigt die kirsche auf der sahnehaube hat leider gefehlt aber 245 kilometer fahre ich auch nicht jeden tag f r eine medaille muss an so einem tag alles passen wir waren nur ein miniteam k nnen aber mit erhobenem haupt weggehen f r einen platz in den top ten h tten wir die richtige post erwischen m ssen

2459173 i always think of heaven as being a place where we wont have any troubles anymore
2459174 im looking forward to meeting my mom and dad and the rest of my family
2459175 no tears no mourning no suffering its eternal joy and happiness because you are at one with god
2459176 heaven is in another dimension so you dont necessarily have to look up but you can look out and see heaven heaven is a fourth dimension if you will
2459177 the real life is the next life and based upon how we live this life it determines where we shall be in the next we are told we will be in comfortable homes reclining on silk couches so were given the delights of sex the delights of wine the delights of food with all of their positive things without their negative aspects
2459178 jesus christ guarantees eternal life to anybody thatll follow him the purpose of life is to glorify god and go to heaven cause heaven is our home
2459179 for the past 2 000 years most jews believed that at death the body and the soul separate the body is interred and disintegrates in the earth the soul goes off to be with god
2459180 at the end of days god will resurrect bodies will reunite body and soul and the individual will come before god to account for his or her life
2459181 if someone do es very bad badly kill or steal he could be born in an animal body
2459182 i dont think necessarily heaven and hell happen in some other life i think its right now
2459183 whether a person is spiritual or not is not necessarily a matter of their will
2459184 its a gene thats called vmat2 and we can isolate it and we can study it in detail this particular gene controls certain chemicals in the brain and those chemicals affect how consciousness works they affect the way that our feelings react to the events around us
2459185 the parts of the brain that monitor our sense of time and space became less active
2459186 attributed to god for example and then they feel that god is providing them that energy that feeling
2459187 heaven doesnt exist hell doesnt exist we werent alive before we were born and were not going to exist after we die im not happy about the fact that thats the end of life but i can accept that and make my life more fulfilling now because this is the only chance i have
2459188 my near death experience changed everything about me there is not a single experience on earth that could ever be as good as being dead
2459189 when the oxygen levels fall in the brain you get massive over activity in the brain i think there is a true transformation but not because youve been to heaven
2459190 i had growing up a lot of questions about these deaths that occurred in my family with no person to really talk to them about it
2459191 my daughter who was about 6 or 7 at the time started asking me a lot of the same questions that i had had as a child really basic questions why do you put somebody in a coffin where does she go now is she scared in the box can she breathe in the box and what was interesting barbara was that she started answering the questions for herself so i started writing down her answers
2459192 theres one thing i would say about heaven if you believe that theres a heaven your life here on earth here is different you may believe that youre gonna see your loved ones again so the grief that you had after theyre gone isnt as strong you may believe that youll have to answer for your actions so the way you behave here on earth is changed so in a certain way just believing in the idea of heaven is heavenly in and of itself

2459218 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2459219 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2459220 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

2459244 when we come through that history tells us thats not something thats going to play through in months its going to be well through the year end
2459245 wed expect people to plan on that type of assumption and weve been working with individual institutions to ensure we are comfortable with their longer term plans
2459246 we deem the longer term plan to be that sort of time horizon
2459247 if people want to dampen down these cycles and to ensure banks are less likely to violently react in a downturn to some degree they will have to accept there will be less on the upturn as well

2459306 there is so much conflicting information directed at the public about what to eat what is healthy what supplements to buy and what to do about various health diagnoses i felt it was important to get healthcare practitioners together to work as a team for each client we can now offer a comfortable setting to get reliable information to clients and to also give them tools and training for how to apply this knowledge in their daily lives
2459307 we are reminded that sports can act as a tool that can bridge cultures and cross linguistic and ideological barriers as global citizens we are all well aware of the fact that the sports experience is priceless to be outdoors routing for your home team and spending time with friends and loved ones

2459309 we chose the laser after seeing results in patients for more than two years without any significant adverse effects or disruption to their schedule
2459310 we are proud to offer our patients the advantage of this cutting edge application of radiation technology because it promotes less x ray exposure and allows for convenient treatment when patients want care
2459311 that cumulative x ray exposure from ct scans and other sources can be very harmful so we always want to do what we can to minimize x ray exposure for patients
2459312 because it is faster and much less imposing than a traditional x ray machine
2459313 simply put patients want convenience and safety and the mini c arm offers both
2459314 we wish mr dean a speedy recovery our thoughts and prayers go out to mr dean
2459315 ongoing safety training and facility inspections are a vital component for all facilities housing big cats

2459318 even though business is ruff out there we feel we are barking up the right tree on this line
2459319 this book had a good message about a girl trying to help a baby star i think this a nice theme in the book in that it is about humans interacting with nature the star i liked the cd since i work in a school we are always looking for books that are on tape or cd that can be read to kids that have a difficult time with reading i like that this product came with that it was also a nice visual to have to doll that came with it this provided different ways that the book can be used beyond just reading it to a child
2459320 the most positive characteristics of this book were the illustrations and the colors the book is so vibrant in color that it made you want to read i liked that it came with an audio cd i also liked that the book story had a positive message the nana star plushie was a nice add also to play along with the audio cd
2459321 the positive characteristics of this book is that it was a simple story of a topic children can relate to of being lost or not being able to find see someone they love some of the children talked about not seeing their grandma for long times and they seem to relate to nana
2459322 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over
2459323 the characters in the story were cute and the illustrations were attractive and appealing to my children having the plush to go along with the book made it more fun for the children the story taught a lesson about fear and loneliness something everyone experiences at one time or another
2459324 this is a great story to help children feel that they are never alone and are always being watched over
2459325 we have been shushed our entire lives and wanted a place where we could be free to laugh out loud if we wanted
2459326 and children are introduced to characters who are very mature
2459327 i know ill dig up some old pics and scan them i mean ive been places ive done things ive eaten stuff

2459331 now i know the players very well and i have more confidence
2459332 claro que es especial el marcar mi primer gol con la real porque aunque cuando valen de verdad es cuando se compite aportar cosas al equipo siempre es positivo yo no suelo significarme por conseguir muchos tantos as que cuando hago alguno me alegro porque suelo llegar al rea pero luego viene el problema igual aqu me va mejor aunque lo que tiene que esperar la gente de mi es crear juego
2459333 lo fundamental de la pretemporada es coger el tono f sico la sinton a de juego con los compa eros y llevar a la pr ctica los conceptos del entrenador pero ganar siempre viene bien y ayuda a que todo lo anterior llegue algo m s f cil
2459334 creo que el f tbol que lillo quiere que hagamos se adapta bastante bien al que suelo hacer yo y puede que por esto me est adaptando r pido aunque todav a hay mucha cosas que mejorar tambi n est influyendo lo bien que me ha acogido el vestuario
2459335 he encontrado ayuda desde el principio y desde el principio soy uno m s
2459336 estoy muy a gusto de verdad sab a que el tema de la ley concursal al principio provoca un caos pero en lo deportivo sab a que llegaba a un gran club y un gran equipo y as est siendo me gustaba la plantilla antes de venir y estoy ratificando esa impresi n que creo que a falta de los que puedan llegar es compensada y competitiva pero esto lo tendremos que demostrar en la liga
2459337 he venido con la idea de ayudar de aportar mi granito de arena a que la real luche por volver a primera soy de los que piensa que todos somos prescindibles y que unas temporadas unos juegan mejor y otras otros por lo que lo m s importante es el equipo la competitividad y el rendimiento del grupo es lo que hace que una temporada sea buena o mala
2459338 no soy de los que miran mucho el dise o de las botas sino su comodidad y el modelo que llevo me gusta mucho m s all del color no las llev amarillas por nada en especial sino como te digo porque el modelo me gust y al tener s lo un 40 de pie no es tan f cil encontrar botas

2459350 i mean its a musical for one and ive always wanted to do that
2459351 ive been dancing all my life and i was a gymnast for a while im not saying it was easy because it was challenging choreography but in a good way i like to be challenged
2459352 the only response that ive had so far was at the chicago premiere where there were about 2 000 kids hanging out and they loved the film
2459353 i was pleased but i was a little surprised because i didnt expect it they really didnt need to do that they could have been objective and hated it and not say anything but they went out of their way so they really liked it
2459354 ally is a stronger girl and doesnt need a guy in her life to sort of be a better person or feel better about herself whereas mia is always sort of looking for that other person ally is a capricorn ive decided shes a capricorn sure it would be great to have someone but if she doesnt shell be fine
2459355 we had a month of rehearsals and dancing and it was crazy but it was great
2459356 it was boot camp like a dancers boot camp wed get up at seven in the morning and dance between eight and four p m and then wed go into the studio
2459357 theres a thing called rock band i dont know if youve ever played it but we actually even had a lot of time learning how to play rock band because we had to play it in the movie
2459358 its a little hectic but its good because i think this is the situation that every actor wants to be in you always want to be working
2459359 im fortunate enough to actually be working the majority of the year degrassi between may and december and then the other four months i spent filming on this movie
2459360 my mom is the only person in my family who has seen the film
2459361 usually the mother or the parent is the one who goes oh my god youre so good but my mom is a tough critic shes my toughest critic and she liked it as well she was very proud of me and the acting she just loved it and im really happy she responded that way too
2459362 we filmed while it was open so people were watching us from the railings up above on our breaks we would go and actually shop in the mall because it was still open and we got 15 off everywhere so i was pretty happy with it
2459363 the only thing i can say is that mia goes through a major transformation in the first couple of episodes and she does some things that shes not proud of in order to get what she wants
2459364 ascoltami bene non dirmi che sono bianco perche e una cazzata razzista sono

2459370 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2459371 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2459372 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2459373 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2459374 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2459375 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2459376 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2459377 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2459395 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2459396 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2459397 this weekend we all are coming out here with pressure washers to get this campus ready for the first meeting with parents and students on friday

2459415 they decided to do it after i entered the race and after the push back from the business community
2459416 they decided to lower business impact fees after they voted not to lower them i always tell people in my mind ive already won because i got them to focus on economic development
2459417 im not surprised he did it because he has always had the idea that republicans should select their nominee and the democrats should select their nominee
2459418 all you have to do is look at the timetable i may be wrong but i can only look at the data thats out there
2459419 there really wasnt any opposition to it at the time and there hasnt been any opposition to it since then
2459420 so it really is not an issue for me thats my only reply to that
2459421 they can create laws that encourage the identification of illegal immigrants
2459422 just like san francisco has a law that says they are a sanctuary city they marion county can take the opposite position
2459423 we havent gotten to the point where we can make a final decision and know thats the correct decision to lead us 20 to 30 years down the road
2459424 we administer pre trial intervention provide substance abuse education operate the victim impact panel collect and account for probation costs participate in dui court and provide shoplifting deterrence classes
2459425 with approximately 1 500 people currently on probation we are in court daily there are four judges working diligently to stay atop massive dockets and our role is to assist in effectively managing that caseload
2459426 the salvation army and more specifically linda rankin has established a can do reputation in meeting the needs of marion county
2459427 we are self funded no contributions to the salvation army or taxpayer dollars go into our operations the money is derived from the cost of supervision paid by offenders
2459428 we want to help people successfully complete probation or any other diversion program that requires that we not only ensure they meet their court mandated terms but that we also be responsive to events affecting their ability to comply when appropriate we will even financially assist them in getting treatment for substance abuse problems that have contributed to their criminal offense
2459429 i could not leave my pregnant girlfriend unsupported while i served six months in jail without the financial assistance to pay for the treatment i was sunk
2459430 being in the dui program has really changed my life i still have fines to pay but i have a job and a positive future without the salvation armys help things could have turned out badly
2459431 if we can keep people out of jail and provide them the tools to change their lives we will
2459432 we believe that the work of the corrections program is a valuable asset to the community by making a positive impact for change in the lives of the probationers preventing further legal encounters and thus saving the taxpayers dollars
2459433 much of the programs advancement has come while linda rankin has been involved with the program
2459434 she has amassed a great deal of knowledge in the criminal justice area her longevity speaks volumes to her commitment of helping others
2459435 its heavy its hard and in the hands of someone like mr pappas who appears to be a rather strong man eight times is unreasonable

2459437 if youre a police officer and youre going to beat someone are you going to use your police radio

2459440 good at it and it was easy and most of the time you wont get caught
2459441 you wont find my fingerprints or dna in the house i was wearing socks
2459442 he was crying like a baby asking for his mommy he told me he was sorry and he would do anything to make it up to me

2459450 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
2459451 there has been no decision by israel to stop selling weapons the gossip about that in the israeli media is linked to the internal political process in israel
2459452 so i said sam how about this ill call you crab eye or ill call you ranter
2459453 sam looked at me and said i will take that under advisement
2459454 look around here today and you can see how many people he touched its people like rabbi berman who make ocala and marion county so special
2459455 sam was bigger than life and he would help anybody
2459456 sam was a presence in his congregation and his community he always had gentle words and kind way for people who needed comfort
2459457 today was not supposed to be a day of mourning
2459458 it was supposed to be a day of rejoicing and sam was supposed to get better and enjoy life sam is gone but his joyful spirit will always be with us
2459459 sam was a special messenger from god who showed us that all life is given so it can be lived to the fullest
2459460 rabbi sam inspired you to become involved and help people
2459461 it didnt matter if you were jewish or not if you needed help he would be there even the way he answered his phone rabbi sam here you knew you could count on him i dont know how we can replace him
2459462 sam was a perfect big brother and i could always rely on him to be my guide and protector giving him a kidney was a small price to pay for all he did for me a piece of me died with him and it wasnt a kidney it was the bond between us as brothers
2459463 i cant remember meeting him without seeing dale they served together in the vineyards of the lord
2459464 no matter what faith sam believed we all share a belief in a higher power
2459465 he described it life and faith as a circle and we all walk a path in the circle and he believed we all need each other
2459466 the love and gifts from sam will go on and on
2459467 the teacher was employed by the school governing body and has since resigned the school will be calling in the learner and his parents for a hearing before appropriate disciplinary action can be taken
2459468 after a bout of sex the body releases endorphins known as happy chemicals
2459469 from a physical point of view its similar to enjoying a good workout or going swimming but if youre having sex with someone you love it also makes you feel cared for and promotes self esteem
2459470 theres no doubt that sex is relaxing and so helps tackle insomnia
2459471 lots of people use sex whether with a partner or on their own as a way of getting to sleep the surge in oxytocin is a natural sedative
2459472 it is also released in people in secure relationships and during sexual contact
2459473 often when i see couples in trouble they have stopped having sex and one of them will say their partner no longer finds them attractive
2459474 we know that having a strong relationship is a good indicator of longevity and a healthy sex life is a big part of that

2459519 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2459520 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2459521 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2459522 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2459523 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2459524 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2459525 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2459526 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2459529 then something happened on day 4 of my stay i was shaking out my beach towel the sun was starting to edge down my hunger was beginning to rise up a lobster bake was going on somewhere and as the grains of sand flew out onto the beach i realized i had forgotten something i had forgotten to check my e mail indeed i had forgotten about e mail entirely for nearly the whole day and heres the funny thing it was on this vacation that my life changed in many wonderful ways not the least of which is this i learned that taking a break from the stress of daily life gives you the resources to better handle it when you return

2459535 president bush is so emphatic about going to the olympics in china that one might think flying halfway around the globe to attend is simply what presidents do never before now has a u s president attended an olympic games on foreign soil and bush isnt just dropping by he is managing his time to soak in as much as he can the way the president sees it this grand world affair begins and ends with sports not politics in a long line of presidents who have been sports buffs there may be no bigger one than bush who has set up unfettered blocks of time in beijing to watch athletes compete
2459536 players have to tick a lot of boxes for us to be interested

2459559 nioc is from now on obliged to deposit 100 percent of crude oil export income in foreign bank accounts that are chosen by the central bank of iran
2459560 this decision was made after the expansion of new rounds of sanctions against iran so that irans assets are not blocked in foreign banks
2459561 many foreign banks and even some chinese banks have cut their financial operations with iran and these restrictions increase day by day

2459574 i just listen to the dieticians and nutritionists and i make the weight cushty
2459575 conde nast travelers hughes says its about coming up with better ideas
2459576 you have to be really out there you have to be aggressive as a sales team advertisers are demanding great programs and they scrutinize every dollar they spend the titles that are hungry for the business and coming up with good ideas are going to win the business
2459577 this is when it really counts to have good product and smart programs building a base of smart programs that are unique to our brand and compelling enough to advertisers that makes them feel theyre getting so much value with their dollars
2459578 those who have strong programs in place and are strong brands will do fine it just wont be one of those years where everyone is breaking open champagne bottles
2459579 its not so much that ad budgets are totally cut advertisers are just being cautious but if you keep going in and keep bringing fresh ideas theyll still have that money
2459580 things are tough but theyve been tough before and all of these magazines continue to publish and last and endure
2459581 in terms of selling advertising it is back to basics 101
2459582 integration will be a key those brands who can differentiate by being a brand leader and then have communication with consumers across all media will be the ones that succeed

2459651 its overwhelming but ive learned as ive come up the ranks that you prioritize i will find out what the adjutant general expects of me educate myself and find people to assist me in accomplishing those missions
2459652 he brings a wealth of experience that will be an asset to the future readiness of soldiers and airmen as we continue to fight the war on terror
2459653 its just a good number i asked the doctor if its ok if i could have him on the eighth instead of the 16th
2459654 everybody was on board we wouldnt put the child in jeopardy to get it accomplished

2459656 the second doctor couldnt come in on 8 08 08
2459657 so she switched again dr christrup works on fridays and he said he would come in and do it

2459659 we pulled into the parking lot and all of a sudden this twister was there
2459660 i hollered for my kids to get back inside and then i saw the back part of the roof come up
2459661 we were just sitting inside and we heard a boom
2459662 we went outside the roof was off and there was plywood next to these cars and some debris in the street

2459664 we have to speed up the process on our end
2459665 to send them letters and to threaten them hasnt motivated them
2459666 its like i died and came to a new place

2459670 i know we did have some hiccups but things are being worked out as we speak
2459671 buses that are tied to an elementary school they have to tag those babies and make sure that theyre on the right bus
2459672 its a shame the children had a great attitude and this is what happened

2459679 so it was when you heard the voice from the midst of darkness while the mountain is burning with fire that you came near to me all the heads of tour tribes and your elders
2459680 such a heart in them that they would fear me and always keep all my commandments that it might be well with them and with their children forever
2459681 and the lord said to moses when you go back to egypt see that you do all those wonders before pharaoh which i will put in your hand but i will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go
2459682 the lords personal and direct involvement in the affairs of men so that his purposes might be done is revealed as god informed moses what would take place pharaoh was also warned that his own refusal would bring judgment on him v 23 previously moses had been told that god was certain of pharaohs refusal this interplay between gods hardening and pharaohs hardening his heart must be kept in balance
2459683 example of gods inscrutable will and absolute power to intervene as he chooses
2459684 now when the people complained it displeased the lord for the lord heard it and his anger was aroused so the fire of the lord burned among them and consumed some in the outskirts of the camp then the people cried out to moses and when moses prayed to the lord the fire was quenched

2459700 it made me reflect on the freedoms i have going to school where i went to school and the people that came before obama like martin luther king presidents like abraham lincoln that paved the way for me to be sitting here on abcnews and making a song from obamas speech
2459701 the speech was inspiring about making change in america and i believe what it says and i hope everybody votes
2459702 im blown away by how many people wanted to come and be a part of it in a short amount of time it was all out of love and hope for change and really representing america and looking at the world
2459703 we didnt talk to anybody there we just came together because it was an inspirational song about change coming out of his speech

2459731 a mans mind falls ill when he relinquishes his hold on truth not by lying though he lie often for in that case the injury to the spirit can be repaired by contrition and the renewal of good will but by an inward revolt from truth true illness of the mind and spirt sets in when a man no longer cherishes truth but despises it when he uses it as a means to his own ends when in the depths of his soul truth ceases to be to him the primary the most important concern in such a case a man may not appear ill indeed he may be functioning efficiently and successfully but the order of his being is deranged the scales with which he measures are out of balance he no longer distinguishes between ends and means he can no longer tell the destination from the way he has lost the inner certainty of direction he lacks answers to those final questions why for what purpose and his whole being is affected what has all this to do with adoration in fact everything for the man who worships god will never risk losing his balance entirely whoever adores god in his heart and mind and also when the moment arises in actual practice is being truly protected he may make many mistakes he may be deeply bewildered and shaken but in the last analysis the order and direction of his life are secure
2459732 to come to the opera in a brown coup was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in ones own carriage and departure by the same means had the immense advantage of enabling one with a playful allusion to democratic principles to scramble into the first brown conveyance in the line instead of waiting till the cold and gin congested nose of ones own coachman gleamed under the portico of the academy it was one of the great most masterly intuitions to have discovered that americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it

2459735 when the lord lifted himself from the earth there began the wait until he comes 1 cor 11 26 on earth since there has been a single confident expectation and faith means to persevere in this expectation for him who has no faith events take place as though their meaning lay in themselves the ordinary and the exceptional the high and the low the frightful and the beautiful everything that makes history all are regarded as if each was by itself and there were nothing besides in truth the lords departure as like the striking of a mighty chord that is now suspended in the air waiting to float away and come to rest
2459736 size does matter for example on any given sunday there are more catholics at mass in the three largest parishes in greenville sc hardly a hotbed of catholicism than there are episcopalians at every episcopal parish in south carolina combined brothers i offer no defense of ugly buildings unworthy worship and sloppy catechesis but when you consider that there are as many catholics in the us alone as there anglicans in the entire world perhaps you can began to grasp the sheer size of our task
2459737 christianity is not based on a set of ideas nor on a unique religious experience nor on spiritual insight it is based on things that happened in history and it rests finally on a story the liturgical year impresses this story on our hearts and minds as we hear the scripture read week after week in the liturgy the words of the scriptures acquire a meaning that are not a matter of individual or private interpretation but meanings that are shared by the whole church and not only the church of the present but the church through the ages the church has its own language and one might say that its dictionary is the bible but a dictionary is not enough to learn a language one needs practice in how the language works one needs to hear it spoken to use the words and one needs the grammar the liturgy is the grammar of how the words of the bible are to be used and understood in the liturgy we learn what passages go with other passages how words are to be used and understood what images and metaphors are understood in short we learn to become citizens of the city of god and finally in the liturgy the scripture comes to us not as words to be understood but a reality that changes our lives

2459771 nearly every week brings news of another act of forced high mindedness
2459772 all in all i thought we played some good footy
2459773 it was just a shame we maybe could have kicked a little straighter to take away some of that i suppose hope that they had maybe up to the first quarter
2459774 we might have reduced that and it might have been a little bit easier
2459775 it is pleasing to have over a 10 goal win i dont think weve done that for a fair while at the club
2459776 i think the players felt a bit of relief that it was not always scratch and fight and crawl and just trying to get a win up
2459777 its great that the light flickers or the opportunity still sits there but for us the main thing was getting back on the winning wagon again
2459778 were dedicated to giving our players an opportunity to sink or swim and also the young players an opportunity to develop their game and an understanding of how tough it is and how good the opposition are

2459787 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2459788 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2459789 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2459790 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2459791 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2459792 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2459793 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2459794 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2459802 whatever weakens and breaks up marriage and the family such as cohabitation and divorce even if it may appear to solve some difficulties for individuals has serious and lasting consequences on the common good of our society the experiences of other countries bear witness to this i think the best answer to the bollocks is gavin gulias view let me start by saying that i consider divorce to be a facultative right this means that once legalised the right will be there and can be applied but only if it is needed there seems to be a perception that the introduction of divorce will somehow force people to go down that road even if they dont want to but it doesnt work that way even so however let us assume for a minute that i myself am against divorce in principle well who am i to deny others that right

2459820 wed expect people to plan on that type of assumption and weve been working with individual institutions to ensure we are comfortable with their longer term plans
2459821 we deem the longer term plan to be that sort of time horizon
2459822 if people want to dampen down these cycles and to ensure banks are less likely to violently react in a downturn to some degree they will have to accept there will be less on the upturn as well where theres the right amount of credit available to consumers
2459823 when these people keep on referring to the celebration of internment it sitcks in my throat because internment was nothing to celebrate
2459824 we need to call this bonfire for what it really is an excuse for drinking and ligoniel certainly doesnt need another drunken party
2459825 such bonfires shouldnt take place at all and this one in ligoniel seems to be quite wrong
2459826 its 37 years since internment began its time we stoped all this and got on without commemorating something so traumatic and difficult like internment which led to such misery for many people
2459827 there is no need for this and to do it on council grounds is unacceptable i would call on those behind the bonfire to desist saying its for the kids is a load of nonsense this type of activity does nothing of the sort and only encourages anti social behaviour
2459828 the effect on my clients on a day to day basis of the failure to prosecute is severe
2459829 a failure to prosecute and convict would be the ultimate betrayal of them by the government it would be the ultimate rejection of them and of their rights as human beings
2459830 the market is starting to look at the senior debt of the gses as approaching full faith and credit obligations of the u s government

2459835 in general it is a bit more difficult compared to before to sell their debt in auctions
2459836 at the end of the day this is a problem for the markets
2459837 from the corporate perspective there has definitely got to be some sort of yield enhancement what savings there are are going to higher quality paper
2459838 er zijn mensen met een hogere behoefte aan spanning en variatie in het verkeer in veel gevallen blijken dat mannen die langer dan vijftien jaar in het bezit zijn van een rijbewijs zij vertonen gedrag dat de maatschappij als riskant bestempelt maar ervaren dat zelf niet zo
2459839 ze zien zichzelf als sportieve rijders overtreden vaker de verkeersregels en zijn snel afgeleid algemeen geldt dat mensen functioneren op een spanningsniveau waarbij ze zich prettig voelen voor sommige mensen is 140 kilometer per uur rijden het niveau waarbij ze zich prettig voelen ze rijden dan niet zo om bijvoorbeeld een ongeluk te veroorzaken

2459859 fringe sunday is the fringes way of saying a big thank you to the people of edinburgh
2459860 for the 28th year running the meadows hosts a fringe event that invites families and edinburgh residents to enjoy a selection of fringe shows for free the event grows in popularity year on year the acts showcased are drawn from all genres
2459861 the edinburgh farmers market traders will join street performers comics dancers and actors again this year giving crowds a chance to not only taste but also discover more about local produce
2459862 over 150 acts will perform on seven performance spaces made up of tents and outdoor stages not including the street performers
2459863 as ever the open arts festivals programme will be comprehensively represented with all from cabaret to comedy kids to physical theatre music to fire breathing street performers with local through to world theatre companies represented throughout the day fringe sunday represents the best and most varied performances of fringe 2008
2459864 we expected 5000 to 10 000 people for the first fringe sunday and 40 000 turned up there were no stages just crowds of people around spaces where people were performing i remember ben elton doing an incredible kind of rap thing on the steps of st giles cathedral
2459865 this incident just goes to demonstrate the dangers of climbing on the rocks on arthurs seat we have been called out to enough incidents here to know that this kind of behaviour is dangerous
2459866 the boy was being monitored at all times however on his way up arthurs seat he left the path and went climbing by himself and fell between 25 and 30 feet fortunately his fall was broken by some gorse
2459867 his injuries have been described as relatively minor speaking on behalf of all of the emergency services involved here today we would encourage people to look on this incident as a valuable safety lesson
2459868 please keep enjoying arthurs seat and the beautiful views of edinburgh that it offers but do it in a safe responsible way there are paths up both sides of holyrood park so there is no need to take unnecessary risks
2459869 these types of incidents do occur from time to time we do ask visitors to the park to be mindful of potential dangers when visitors stray from the path or take a route theyre not fully equipped for they are opening themselves up to some additional risk
2459870 this is a fairly standard security measure at all mod establishments and that is why we have applied for permission to install these cameras
