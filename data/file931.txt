9310011 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9310012 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9310013 according to these agreements the russians had certain rights on georgian territory
9310014 now the russians have no rights whatsoever on georgian territory their presence here is illegal and they should leave georgia

9310092 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9310093 and it is warm not something im really used to
9310094 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9310095 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9310096 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me

9310109 imposing house arrest and suspending the fourth amendment for law abiding people is only going to cause more problems for this city
9310110 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
9310111 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
9310112 have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears god and shuns evil
9310113 have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has you have blessed the work of his hands so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land 11 but stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face
9310114 very well then everything he has is in your hands but on the man himself do not lay a finger

9310142 the seed gradually takes shape in the uterus and it abortion does not count as killing until the individual elements have acquired their external appearance and their limbs
9310143 now as i looked at the living creatures i saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures one for each of the four of them as for the appearance of the wheels and their construction the four had the same likeness being as it were a wheel within a wheel the four wheels had rims and they had spokes and their rims were full of eyes round about and when the living creatures went the wheels went beside them and when the living creatures went the wheels went with them for the living creature was in the wheel
9310144 a man is not justified by observing the law but by faith in jesus christ

9310167 as the estimated cost of measures proposed by politicians to combat global warming soars ever higher such as the international energy councils 45 trillion fighting climate change has become the single most expensive item on the worlds political agenda
9310168 as senators obama and mccain vie with the leaders of the european union to promise 50 60 even 80 per cent cuts in carbon emissions it is clear that to realise even half their imaginary targets would necessitate a dramatic change in how we all live and a drastic reduction in living standards
9310169 all this makes it rather important to know just why our politicians have come to believe that global warming is the most serious challenge confronting mankind and just how reliable is the evidence for the theory on which their policies are based
9310170 no one no matter how poor he is wants to move to plain states we need people who are accustomed to northern weather people who are willing to waste their lives in the dakotas
9310171 es tan acelerado que el equilibrio de las distintas situaciones es cada vez m s precario y su duraci n m s corta
9310172 es meritorio el esfuerzo que el gobierno y las comunidades aut nomas est n haciendo para incentivar este mercado
9310173 pero los plazos que comunidades y ayuntamientos requieren para recalificar nuevo suelo aprobar proyectos y ponerlos en marcha supondr un retraso de tiempo que no permitir a la vpo ser una v a para atajar los problemas del sector al menos en el pr ximo a o y medio
9310174 que la vpo vaya a ser o no soluci n a la crisis depende de que las entidades concedan financiaci n para este tipo de viviendas a sus promotores pero tambi n a sus compradores

9310185 go write another one of your moronic posts about me again i dare you
9310186 ive noticed in the past that anyone who shows any signs of rejecting him or his lunatic rantings are subject to his childish attacks especially if its a woman i think he has some deep seeded mother issue maybe he was potty trained with a whip or something
9310187 well it was john goods post that caught the attention of a sick and deranged blogger danl from the future was yesterday danil caught the wind of those butterfly wings and whipped them into a multiple vortex tornado you see it really wasnt my political views that caused danl to go into such a frenzy it was nothing more than an excuse to spew his demented psychosis on his pathetic excuse for a blog
9310188 it was his spiteful little post about me that put danl into such a frenzy

9310196 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9310197 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9310198 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9310199 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9310200 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9310201 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9310202 generational change tends to be accelerated when the party is in trouble
9310203 its the natural order of things were really lucky in ohio quite frankly because we have some amazingly talented leaders house speaker jon husted kevin dewine state auditor mary taylor despite their youth they have some tremendous experience
9310204 i think thats going to serve the party and the state of ohio very well
9310205 i think we are in a great spot as a party having new faces and new folks and new energy and ideas on the horizon
9310206 hes been very very capable in terms of brokering deals and being able to reach across the aisle
9310207 at the same time hes remained steadfast on the core issues hes not somebody you hear people talking about with bile in their voice jon to me seems like the future of the republican party in ohio

9310214 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9310215 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9310216 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9310217 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9310218 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9310219 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9310220 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9310221 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9310222 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9310223 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9310224 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9310225 if you believe me i promise you that we will not just win ohio we will win this election you and i and joe biden we will change this country and we will change the world
9310226 we need change in this country and ohio and barack is committed to policies that i believe will move this country forward
9310227 they could have picked off any woman off any street corner and it would have been more appealing to women
9310228 but reform means you understand the problem and you have a strategy to deal with it
9310229 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9310230 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9310231 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9310232 mccain promised to us that he would appoint more women at cabinet level and high level positions than any other president in history
9310233 the choice of a competent woman strengthens the ticket in the eyes of those voters
9310234 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9310235 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9310236 in this season of high profile politics their needs to be a renewed focus on poverty
9310237 the present policy is to close plants or move jobs its the result of bad trade policy
9310238 but yesterdays middle class is today impoverished class theres a sinking feeling its an outward flow of plants and jobs and an inward flow of drugs and guns
9310239 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9310240 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9310241 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9310242 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9310243 job training programs and a way to pay for college for low income families
9310244 the solution is not to put up trade barriers but to improve education for the jobs of the future
9310245 k 12 education needs to be accelerated especially in science and math the community college system needs to be upgraded to meet the new opportunities out there
9310246 the standards arent high enough if companies arent seeing ohios young people coming in and being able to take their jobs theyre going to leave the state
9310247 we clearly have policy burdens that keep us from growing and its not just in manufacturing
9310248 texas has added on the order of 50 000 new jobs since 2002 when weve been losing on the order of 2 000
9310249 stop giving these tax breaks that move our jobs out of the country bring our men home from iraq and give us universal health care
9310250 now if we can get these things accomplished in about 30 days ill be ok
9310251 mike has been a longtime supporter of kids voting and has lent his talents to kids voting as a political cartoon judge an illustrator and spokesperson for several public service announcements so it is only natural to honor him at the bash
9310252 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9310253 everyone needs to use caution when coming across this individual
9310254 we dont know what his mental state is right now
9310255 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9310256 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9310257 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9310258 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9310259 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9310260 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9310261 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9310262 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9310263 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9310264 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9310265 since the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan we have seen an increased need for veteran housing and services
9310266 we realize this need and are working with other area organizations to provide veterans a place to call home proper medical attention and educational programs to help them thrive independently
9310267 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9310268 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9310269 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9310270 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9310271 i wish i could say that was the case everywhere but its not
9310272 the way dayton area institutions collaborate on the subject of economic growth recognizing the role that they play in the economy of this region is very significant
9310273 it particularly understands the unique role it plays in relationship to wright patterson air force base and how important that is to our economic future
9310274 its a focused growing institution and were very proud of it
9310275 weve invested recently three new faculty research positions in their research institute theyve also been a real leader on education
9310276 in terms of community building making the kind of livable community that people will want to live in
9310277 weve also encouraged them to work beyond the immediate boundaries of montgomery county too theyre doing more work in hamilton and middletown at the miami university regional campuses there clearly one of the leading community colleges in the state
9310278 the governor and the general assembly just made an extraordinary commitment to building a new student union at central state
9310279 i think its telling that the person i chose as my vice chancellor for academic affairs comes out of the adult education world because we know that two thirds of our growth of our higher education in the plan is going to be adults 25 and older
9310280 working in springfield to become an attractive part of the community to make it a more livable community
9310281 but we havent done quite as much work with them as yet
9310282 miami is really one of the best undergraduate campuses in the country president david hodge has said their goal is to be the best and provide the highest quality undergraduate education in the country we want them to be no 1
9310283 there was no safety issue at any time and the aircraft continued to frankfurt where it landed without incident
9310284 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9310285 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9310286 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9310287 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9310288 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9310289 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9310290 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9310291 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9310292 we hope to sell a lot of lcd and big screen plasma televisions
9310293 other than christmas its our biggest television season of the year well have a big sale and well have high hopes
9310294 they know the majority of workers are off work monday and may use that day to shop
9310295 once upon a time back to school sales stopped when school began but in recent years its gone on for a few weeks after that because kids go back to school and see what other kids are wearing
9310296 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9310297 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9310298 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9310299 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9310300 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9310301 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9310302 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9310303 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9310304 the malaysian ship is being sailed towards eyl where another six vessels are held
9310305 the pirates are increasing dramatically in numbers and in strength
9310306 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9310307 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9310308 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9310309 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9310310 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9310311 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9310312 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9310313 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9310314 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9310379 het is verschrikkelijk het is de wreedheid van het feit dat je allebei bekend bent zij omdat ze actrice is ik omdat ik een blaadje over rijke mensen in elkaar plakte het meest intieme dat je bezit is publiek bezit geworden ik houd me voor dat het voor iedereen goed is zn fifteen minutes of shame te beleven een goeie les in nederigheid zeker voor journalisten
9310380 the idea is to allow talented young cricketers the option of completing their high school education
9310381 and the option of adopting cricket as a profession or completing full education and becoming useful citizens
9310382 they face problems adjusting to the glamour fame and money that comes automatically for an international cricketer these days
9310383 the main problem is that our sportsmen dont have facilities to carry on formal education and also play their sport at the same time because of financial constraints
9310384 if we can get only five or six boys good for cricket we would have done our job

9310387 our team of inspirational athletes are very well prepared for the tough competition they have ahead of them in beijing
9310388 this is the largest ever paralympic team to compete overseas and i am greatly looking forward to celebrating their success in beijing
9310389 the 2008 season again affirms the afl as the no 1 spectator sport in australia when combined with the fact that our clubs built a record tally of 574 091 club members for the premiership season
9310390 this was an outstanding result considering the impact of the olympics in the latter part of the season which had an effect on three weeks of our year and our commitment to play matches in darwin carrara launceston and canberra with limited capacity
9310391 i can see the merits of what the iemma government is trying to do with the industry
9310392 however on balance when considering the appalling state of the markets the complete uncertainty with ets emission trading scheme and the broad community distrust of the iemma government to execute the transaction the coalition party room which i support took the view to oppose the legislation as it stands
9310393 barry ofarrell has suddenly pulled out of his back pocket an energy efficiency plan to justify his actions last week to justify actions that were very politically based and he knows it
9310394 i want to see the parliamentary party as well as the organisational wing of the party unite in a constructive fashion to move away from any recriminations that have occurred
9310395 i support privatisation in principle and i guess i probably would have been working to bring it about in practise
9310396 in the end its the public that vote not the business community
9310397 best players on the park anything else after thats a bonus
9310398 were pretty comfortable if were not at home we just want to be playing well injury free
9310399 friday night will challenge us enormously well have a pretty good idea where were at friday night one way or the other
9310400 our start indicated we werent really into it didnt have the right mindset
9310401 the atmospheres not real good out there but if we want to be a good team we need to overcome any sort of situation and just play good footy
9310402 we probably kept fighting the full 80 minutes and we werent too far away in the end
9310403 se pare ca moscova a decis sa si asume rolul de element de bulversare a sistemului ordinii mondiale actuale pervers sub mai multe aspecte

9310405 rusia vede in acest lucruri nu numai o politica partizana ci si un cinism nedisimulat care depaseste orice practica politica normala

9310425 here we are three months later and ive yet to get a control number so i can track the status of my appeal
9310426 whats really sad is that nobody is giving them advice as to whether theyre even going to get relief
9310427 i think the public outrage should be focused on the units of local government that are levying the taxes that capture every cent they can get with little regard to the taxpayer
9310428 its been unfortunate that st clair county has not been willing to put that choice on the ballot for their taxpayers
9310429 we have to remember the strength of our communities is largely due to the strength of the schools and so my understanding in many of the counties that have these laws is the schools tend to suffer
9310430 so what i would hope is that we would take a unified policy to the state legislature and ask them for help in relieving the property tax burden which is think is too great
9310431 we bring these kids into the courtroom in handcuffs with armed deputies
9310432 uses walking restraints for safety and prevention of elopement when clients are sent to an urgent medical appointment or court hearings that they cant miss early in their admission
9310433 the fabric restraints are only used when a patient is determined to be a flight risk and are removed immediately after a patient has returned safely to the facility
9310434 a board certified psychiatrist with extensive experience in childhood trauma and behavioral management must write an order for the use of restraints
9310435 conducted a thorough investigation of the allegations and ultimately dismissed the complaint
9310436 these kids already have mental health problems i would imagine this would exacerbate them these are not bad children and they have not done anything wrong they are just ill
9310437 we do not use them here when we transport children
9310438 it was strongly suggested to me that i switch but my message has always been this job is about performance professionalism and leadership not politics
9310439 they can say what they want about this being a nonpartisan job
9310440 its very clear to me that the republicans tenaciously want to keep their hold on this position the governor gave them
9310441 it would have been the expeditious thing to do but i think it would have been self defeating
9310442 its obvious they didnt want to run against me they recognize im the strongest candidate
9310443 why else would they dump 200 000 into a smear campaign in a democratic primary to defeat one candidate
9310444 i have absolutely no ties to anybody in ken jennes regime
9310445 i asked if he would help and he offered to do a fund raiser for me
9310446 were working on requests from last november itll be a few more months until we get to yours
9310447 right now were working on claims that came in during february
9310448 weve taken extraordinary steps with the reform process and now were working out the kinks with the new system
9310449 even when theres no budget in place unclaimed property payments can still go out its one of those programs thats not tied to the budget
9310450 even if its withdrawing or depositing a dollar once a year anything to keep that account active
9310451 those who dont see the drug war going on around them have their heads stuck in the sand
9310452 the violent mass killings of people not connected to criminal organized violence their cowardly executions is intolerable for mexico
9310453 but id rather eat at home how can i take my wife and my children to a restaurant when i dont know who the people are around what happens if something goes wrong
9310454 any of us could be taken or killed i try to wear nothing and do nothing that attracts attention i wear t shirts and a hat i have no jewelry i dont want to stand out
9310455 you have to be more careful with everything these days
9310456 if you go into a bar and theres a beautiful girl standing alone you have to think twice about going up to her who knows if shes a drug dealers girlfriend if he walks in when youre buying her a beer that could be the end of you
9310457 its impossible to know exactly who is who these days
9310458 the worst thing that can happen is for us to become accustomed to the dramatic daily count of deaths and kidnappings caused by narcotics assassins
9310459 we got united behind our candidate very quickly not just the rank and file but the other candidates as well
9310460 we had that unity early on and i still dont sense that the democrats have it
9310461 mccain may not be the most charismatic candidate but the prospect of an obama presidency is scary enough to energize our folks to work very hard for john mccain
9310462 were getting the bugs out of our system and were getting ready
9310463 shows how important we believe florida is in the presidential race
9310464 had to spend two days making up with the clintons and im not sure anyone knows his agenda
9310465 i think he just ran out of time thats not going to happen with john mccain
9310466 ours is going to be a united front where we get to business earlier in the game voters will notice early on that were presenting a united front and focusing more on the issues
9310467 after eight years of a presidency theres an inevitable factor there
9310468 sinking ships is win win win for us for the community and for marine life
9310469 since now were all contributing i would like to see something happen with that money id like to see some big structure out there
9310470 some of the best habitat ive ever seen anywhere and ive probably dove as much live bottom off this coast as anyone is on shipwrecks
9310471 its unbelievable you can stand on the sand and look up to the surface and there are fish going all the way up to the surface there are sharks and stingrays on the bottom grouper and red snapper on the bottom then you have spade fish and jacks in mid water baitfish are above them and king mackerel and albacore are on the surface
9310472 all we have to do is get money for overland transportation and then the deployment monies
9310473 i think if we could ever get one down and legislators saw the financial benefit to the surrounding areas then they may have a perpetual program set up through the legislature that every four or five years were sinking a big ship
9310474 the artificial reefs that are out there have deteriorated and we dont have a lot of intact ships anymore and thats a big draw
9310475 so thats what wed like to see replenished out there another hundred years from now the ones that are there now probably wont be there anymore and if we expect to pass on to the future generations the huge advantage of wonderful reefs we have then we are going to have to do some wreck replenishment off the coast here
9310476 if i had to pick a priority issue it would be dealing with public access and habitat restoration as opposed to creating artificial reefs in federal waters
9310477 the division and the commission have an opportunity with the rewrite of this plan to look at issues besides commercial fishing operations
9310478 the state could examine and discuss in the plan where the best structures are and where the citizens of north carolina could get the optimum benefit out of putting structure
9310479 artificial reefs are very valuable for the community and fisheries as a whole in my opinion im a retired marine biologist and i know science shows that they do enhance fishing opportunities
9310480 one of the main things that they did when they passed the bill was they told a lot of the fishermen that were initially opposed to it that a lot of it was going to go back to the resource
9310481 thats why the fishermen didnt fuss about it when the law was going through because they thought the money was going to go back into building and helping stocks as opposed to studying them over and over again
9310482 we want something that will help change the situation as opposed to just more of the same old same old
9310483 it sounds very self serving and ill admit that up front id like to see more shipwrecks so i can go dive on them and take people out
9310484 but the diving industry in this area is part of the tourism industry the tourism industry is a huge economic engine in this county and in this state
9310485 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it
9310486 this is the real deal this is not a test for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9310487 i dont want to be stuck like i was in katrina
9310488 new orleans will be impacted but to what degree we dont know
9310489 potential for a significant storm surge we dont know how much or where
9310490 its just like rita its more of a rural storm than an urban storm
9310491 the system itself is stronger than it was before katrina
9310492 weve made great strides but were not there by any stretch of the imagination
9310493 we constantly have to make sure people understand whats going on in our city centers
9310494 there are some individuals that could care less what goes on in the city that are in the suburbs
9310495 suburban areas are now in a position to influence to a greater extent the direction of the government
9310496 the political center of gravity was unquestionably in the city of albany
9310497 we didnt feel we had been getting the same representation that we had been getting
9310498 do you think that the people in colonie and guilderland are worried about whats going on at state and pearl streets we just want to make sure that were heard from
9310499 i think you see people no longer committed to one party or the other and thats the thing that can make or break these elections
9310500 we shouldnt politicize the future of our cities and thats whats happening
9310501 we shouldnt be in competition with the suburbs in this county and thats whats happening
9310502 im sure mccain is thinking is bush going to beat me twice
9310503 the idea that people could think he and bush are at all alike probably drives him crazy
9310504 but if they wake up every morning thinking george w bush is a bigger problem than barack obama theyre going to lose
9310505 youve got a lot of people in that campaign who really dislike the president
9310506 theres still a lot of people who carry a torch for the 2000 campaign
9310507 less than comfortable position in the country you feel bad for the guy if you think about it
9310508 you can hear his texas accent creeping back into his voice rather than the no accent kind of voice
9310509 they look better on iraq but they look worse on everything else
9310510 when i was there that legacy talk was strictly discouraged
9310511 it was considered very destructive and wed all seen what it had done to clinton in his last year that seems to have changed obviously lately from what i hear now he takes it very very seriously he doesnt joke about it like he used to
9310512 its not that you chase polls but youre cognizant of them so if you know theyre not going to change you can just do what you think is right
9310513 he does make a lot of references to truman as the model of his late presidency and the truman model is unrewarded heroism or heroism is not the right word unrewarded courage
9310514 it fits very much his approach and his self conception his view of leadership is defined as doing the right thing against pressure
9310515 ive already taken my last licks for being unpopular so these last two years i do whats right thats my job not with my finger in the air
9310516 i am sure that there have been many times where you have felt like all hope was gone you felt like you wanted to give up or you couldnt make it
9310517 but the reason why this country is such a strong country is because you held on and so i wanted to thank you for that
9310518 but i dont think people know how hard it is to be president of the united states and i wanted to come in and encourage him
9310519 i second guess myself all the time maybe i shouldnt have done this or that he just doesnt have that in him i have never seen him do that i think it gives him a comfort level in that office that others have not had
9310520 assuming the fetal position is just not in his vocabulary
9310521 hes rooted in his walk with christ he believes hes got a role and hes doing what god wants him to do
9310522 and theres a drop of about 15 or 20 feet
9310523 hes the first one to admit that he has an addictive personality and he has to channel this addictiveness to constructive things
9310524 he likes systems he likes structure its interesting for a personality thats so free form he does like structure
9310525 youve always got to give him something to look forward to
9310526 you know obviously theres some good days and some bad days
9310527 i feel so strongly about my principles and my values and im an optimistic guy
9310528 without a basic level of security there will be no political solution and our mission will fail
9310529 he could have taken the baker hamilton report and everyone would have said that was good and instead he took a gigantic political risk which today seems to be paying enormous benefits in terms of security in iraq and political progress and he gets no credit none
9310530 they dont hang out together i dont think johns ever been to camp david i think its respectful president bush respects senator mccain and i think senator mccain respects the office of the presidency
9310531 stuff happened in south carolina that none of us liked
9310532 a combination of the cowardly lion the tin man and the scarecrow
9310533 i endorse governor bush i endorse governor bush i endorse governor bush
9310534 we asked ourselves were they really talking was he really serious it was a general why wont they shut it down thats when weaver called karl
9310535 i dont think theyve quite figured out how to do this
9310536 if theyre going to distance themselves from the president they need to either do it or not do it
9310537 its almost never a good thing to put them together
9310538 i dont want to be unkind here but when youre at 29 percent i think the answer is probably no
9310539 has he said anything nice about my sons foreign policy
9310540 we talk all the time its been a tough run in terms of criticism but thats all right hes strong
9310541 im 84 he doesnt need any advice from an old guy
9310542 i know there are moments when it feels like youre alone in your struggle
9310543 we almost did it was slipping out of our fingers or to use another metaphor the place was heading for the cliff and we pulled it out at the last minute hes going to hand over an iraq that is much better than it was two years ago
9310544 it was mishandled for too long and we deserve blame for this if iraq had gone well bush would be a political colossus and the republican party would bear his imprint in every way but it didnt
9310545 for some of us who were there the frustration is could this have happened earlier
9310546 the hard part for everybody is to say how different would it have been if that decision had been made 12 or 16 months before
9310547 nothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an american presidency like this one in total intellectual collapse
9310548 let me just say from the outset that i dont consider bolton credible
9310549 of course its a different policy than the first term
9310550 i think history will say george bush clearly saw the threats that keep the middle east in turmoil and was willing to do something about it was willing to lead and had this great faith in the capacity of democracies and great faith in the capacity of people to decide the fate of their countries and that the democracy movement gained impetus and gained movement in the middle east
9310551 somebody who took on tough challenges and didnt shy away from doing what he thought was right
9310552 he has a number of pivotal points in his presidency that hes willing to sit down and reflect on
9310553 he believes that history is on his side and if its not hes never going to know
9310554 evidently not in dallas because lauras over there trying to buy a house today
9310555 unfortunately after eight years of asking her to sacrifice i am now no longer the decision maker
9310556 i couldnt see after that light what the hell was that its like it scanned us
9310557 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
9310558 an intellectual is someone who says a simple thing in a difficult way an artist is someone who says a difficult thing in a simple way
9310559 your way begins on the other side become the sky take an ax to the prison wall escape walk out like someone suddenly born into colour do it now
9310560 i am a true bill hillary a true blue hillary supporter but i am sure im sure hillary did not mean to put 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that a pro life pro gun homeschooling nobody from the frozen tundra of alaska could slide in
9310561 a potential vice president with the ideology of dick cheney and fewer qualifications than dan quayle should send arctic shivers up our spines
9310562 while we sit on only three percent of the worlds oil reserves palin thinks we can drill our way out of our oil addiction by exploiting the arctic national wildlife refuge when we should be protecting the climate she is suing the united states to prevent protections for polar bears threatened by global warming when we need to clean up washington she is vocally defending sen ted stevens
9310563 it is our choices far more than our abilities that show who we truly are
9310564 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
9310565 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9310566 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9310567 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9310568 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9310569 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9310570 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9310571 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9310572 who are open to doing something on the production side
9310573 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9310574 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9310575 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9310576 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9310577 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9310578 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9310579 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9310580 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9310581 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9310582 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9310583 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9310584 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9310585 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9310586 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9310587 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9310588 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9310589 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9310590 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9310591 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9310592 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9310593 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9310594 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9310595 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9310596 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9310597 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9310598 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9310599 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9310600 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9310601 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9310602 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9310603 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9310604 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9310605 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9310606 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9310607 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9310608 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9310609 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9310610 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9310611 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9310612 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9310613 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9310614 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9310621 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9310622 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9310623 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9310624 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9310625 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9310626 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9310627 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9310628 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9310629 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9310630 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9310631 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9310632 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9310633 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9310635 as to kin we are of the geat nation hygelacs hearth companions my father was a leader well known among the people edgtheow he stayed many winters before he went away aged from the court every wise man readily remembers him throughout the earth we have come with friendly hearts to see your lord healfdenes son protector of the people be good counsel to us we have come on a great errand to the king of the danes i think it foolish to keep secrets you know if it is true what we have heard that a dark enemy in the nights works violence and slaughter on the danes perhaps in kindness i may advise hrothgar how he wise and famous may overcome this enemy if change will ever come relief from this evil and how this seething sorrow might become cool otherwise he will suffer tribulation as long as he lives in that high place the best of houses
9310636 i see that you are a band friendly to the lord of the danes go forth bearing arms and equipment i will guide you also i will order my men to protect your ship that new tarred boat on the sand until it bears you again back over the water streams with its curved wooden neck back to the land of the geats if it be granted that you endure the battle
9310637 it is time for me to go may the father omnipotent hold you safe and sound in kindness i will go back to the sea to hold against hostile bands
9310638 from where have you carried these gold inlaid shields these shirts of mail masked helmets and battle shafts i am hrothgars messenger and officer never have i seen braver strangers i expect youre here to find adventure not asylum
9310639 we are hygelacs table companions beowulf is my name i will declare to the great lord healfdenes son my errand if your prince will greet us
9310640 i will ask the lord of the danes the giver of rings if he will reward your journey and speedily make his wishes known
9310641 from far over the seas expanse has come a man of the geats a chief of warriors named beowulf he and his men have my lord asked to exchange words with you do not refuse the request hrothgar these men look worthy of a warriors esteem indeed the chief among them he who guides them is strong
9310642 i knew him when he was a boy his father is called edgtheow to that man hrethel of the geats gave his only daughter now his offspring has come in bravery seeking a loyal friend seafarers who took gifts to the geats say that he has the strength of thirty men in his hand grip holy god out of kindness has sent this man to us to save us from grendels terror i shall give treasures to that brave man for his impetuous courage be you in haste go call in this band of kinsmen say to them that they are welcome to the danish people
9310643 my victorious lord prince of the danes bids me say he knows your noble descent and that brave men who come over the sea swells are welcome to him come with your war dress under your helmets to see hrothgar but let your war shields and wooden spears await the outcome of your talk
9310644 i am hygelacs kinsman and warrior i have undertaken many glorious deeds i learned of grendel in my native land seafarers say this place the best of halls stands idle and useless after sundown hrothgar the wise men among my people advised that i seek you because they know my strength they saw me come from battles stained in the blood of my enemies when i destroyed a family of giants when i endured pain all night killing water monsters grinding them to bits to avenge for the geats those who asked for misery and now i shall alone fight grendel i ask you lord of the danes protector of this people for only one favor that you refuse me not fair friend of the people do not refuse those who have come so far the chance to cleanse herot i have heard that the monster in his recklessness uses no weapons i therefore to amuse hygelac my lord scorn to carry sword or shield but i shall seize my enemy in my hand grip and fight enemy against enemy and let god decide who shall be taken by death i expect if he wins that he will eat fearlessly of the geat people in this hall as he often has of yours nor will you need if death takes me worry about a burial that solitary one will carry my corpse dripping with blood to a ruthless feast if battle takes me send this best of war garments this shirt of mail to hygelac it is an inheritance from hrethel and the work of weland fate always goes as it will
9310645 because of past kindness and deeds done you have come my friend beowulf by a killing your father brought about the greatest of feuds he was the killer of heatholaf among the wylfings the geats for fear of war would not have him so he sought us danes over the rolling waves back when i first ruled as a youth this wide kingdom of the danish people this treasure city of heroes heorogar was dead then my older brother the son of healfdene he was better than i i paid money to settle your fathers feud sent treasure over the waters back to the wylfings your father swore oaths to me it is a sorrow for me to say to any man what grendel has done humiliations in herot hostile attacks on my hall warriors until they are diminished swept away in grendels horror god may easily put an end to that mad ravagers deeds quite often have men boasted over their ale cups drunk on beer that they would meet grendels attack in the hall with grim swords but in the morning when the daylight shone the mead hall was stained in gore the hall wet with the blood of battle and i had a few less loyal men sit now and feast glory of warriors and speak your thoughts as your heart tells you
9310646 are you that beowulf who struggled with brecca in the broad sea in a swimming contest the one who out of pride risked his life in the deep water though both friends and enemies told you it was too dangerous are you the one who hugged the sea gliding through the boiling waves of the winters swell you and brecca toiled seven nights in the sea and he with more strength overcame you and in the morning the waves bore him to the heathrames from whence he went home to the brondings beloved of them to his people and mead hall brecca fulfilled all his boast because of this though you have everywhere withstood the battle storm i dont expect much from you if you dare await grendel in the night
9310647 well my friend unferth you have said a good many things about brecca and that trip drunk on beer as you are truth to tell i had more strength but also more hardships in the waves he and i were both boys and boasted out of our youth that we two would risk our lives in the sea and so we did with naked swords in hand to ward off whales we swam brecca could not out swim me nor could i out distance him and thus we were for five nights it was cold weather and the waves surged driving us apart and the north wind came like a battle in the night fierce were the waves and the anger of the sea fish stirred my coat of mail adorned in gold and locked hard by hand helped against those foes a hostile thing drew me to the bottom in its grim grip but it was granted to me to reach it with my swords point the battle storm destroyed that mighty sea beast through my hand and on and on evil things threatened me i served them with my sword as it was right to do those wicked things had no joy of the feast did not sit at the seas bottom eating my bones when the morning came my sword had put many to sleep and even today in that fiord they dont hinder seafarers light shone from the east that bright beacon of god and the seas subsided i saw cliffs the windy walls of the sea fate often saves an undoomed man if his courage holds anyway with my sword i slew nine sea monsters nor have i heard tell of a harder fight or a more distressed man ever to go in the sea i survived the grasp of hostiles and the sea bore me the surging water weary into the land of the finns i have not heard anything about you surviving such battles such terrors of the sword neither brecca nor you have performed such deeds in war sport or with shining swords yet i dont boast about it but you your own brothers murderer shall be damned and burn in hell no matter how strong your wit is i say to you truly son of ecglaf that wretch grendel would never have done such horrors such humiliations on you chief if you were so fierce as you suppose grendel has found he need not fear feud any sword storm from your people he takes his toll showing no mercy to the danish folk he enjoys himself killing and feasting and expects no fight from the danes but i shall offer him the battle of a geat in strength and courage when i get done with him anyone who wishes may happily go into the mead hall as morning shines on the children of men on that day the sun will be clothed in radiance as it shines from the south
9310648 i resolved when i set to sea in my boat with my warriors that i alone will fulfill the wish of your people or die in the foes grasp i shall perform the deeds of a hero or i have passed my last day in this mead hall
9310649 never since i have been able to lift shield have i entrusted this hall this mighty house of the danes to any man but now i entrust it to you have and hold this best of houses keep fame in mind watch against the foe and make your valor known you shall lack nothing if you survive this deed
9310650 i dont claim myself any lower in strength or brave deeds than grendel therefore i will not kill him with a sword though i easily might though he is famous for strength he knows no weapons to cut a shield if he chooses to forego a sword if he dares seek me without weapon then we two shall fight without and wise god that king shall choose who shall win glory
9310651 for this sight i give thanks to the almighty i have suffered much from grendels scourge god the glorious protector works wonder after wonder only yesterday i expected these woes would never end this best of houses stood shining in blood and all my wise ones said we could never protect the people and land from the work of demons and evil spirits now a warrior through gods might has performed a deed we in our wisdom could not contrive the woman who bore you beowulf if she yet lives may say the eternal maker was kind in her child bearing now beowulf best of warriors i love you as a son have from this moment a new kinship nor will there be any lack of earthly things i have power over often i have given gifts to a lesser warrior weaker in fighting you have by your deeds achieved fame forever may god repay you always as he has just now
9310652 we have done this work of valor against the strength of an uncanny foe
9310653 then was the warrior silent in speaking of his war like deed and the nobles beheld the hand at the high roof
9310654 receive this cup my dear lord giver of treasure be in joy gold friend of men and speak to these geats with kind words as men should do be gracious to the geats and mindful of the gifts you have from near and far a man said to me that he would have this warrior for a son herot the bright ring hall is purged give while you can many rewards and leave to your kin people and land when you must go to learn fates decree i know my nephew hrothulf will keep his honor if you king of the danes leave this world earlier that he i know hruthulf will remember what we two wish and the kindness we showed when he was a child
9310655 enjoy this neck ring beloved beowulf young hero and use this armor these treasures of the people thrive well be known for valor and give kind instruction to these two boys i will remember your deeds you have earned forever the praise of men from near and far even to the home of the winds and the walls of the sea be blessed while you live prince i wish you well with the treasures be gentle joyful one to my sons in this place is each warrior true to the other mild in spirit an d faithful to his king the warriors are united the men drink deep and they do my biding
9310656 dont ask about happiness sorrow is renewed among the danish people aeschere is dead yrmenlafs elder brother my confidant the bearer of my advice my shoulder companion when troops clash and boar helmets smashed as a noble prince should be such aeschere was now he has been slain in herot by the hands of a restless murderous spirit i do not know where his carcass has gone to be gladly feasted on she has avenged the feud for your violent killing with hard hand clasps of grendel yesternight for diminishing and destroying my people for so long grendel fell in battle forfeited his life and now another has come a mighty man eater to avenge her kin as is seen by many a warrior who mourns for me treasure giver weeping in their minds for my heavy sorrow a hand lying lifeless who gave good things to you i have heard tell among my people and councilors that they had seen two mighty wanderers in the waste land moors keeping guard alien spirits one was as far as they could see the likeness of a woman the other miserable thing in the stature of a man though he was larger than any other man as they trod the paths of exiles in the days of old earth dwellers called him grendel we have no knowledge of a father of any forebears among evil spirits they occupied the secret land the wolfs retreat windy bluffs perilous fens where a waterfall darkens under bluffs and goes down under the ground it is not far from here by measure of miles that the mere stands over it hangs a frost covered grove woods rooted deep shadowing the water there each night a portent may be seen fire on the water no wise one among the sons of men knows the bottom though the heath stalker the strong horned hart harassed by hounds seeks the forest in his flight he will give his life rather than protect his head by going there that is not a good place there water surges up black to the clouds and the wind stirs up hateful weather so that the sky turns gloomy and weeps again it has happened that the remedy lies with you alone the land the dangerous place where you might find this criminal is unexplored seek it if you dare for that fight i will pay as i did before with wound gold and ancient treasures if you survive
9310657 do not sorrow wise king it is better for a man to avenge a friend than mourn much each of us must await the end of this life he who wishes will work for glory before death that is best for the warrior after he is gone arise guardian of the kingdom let us go quickly to see grendels kin i promise you this she will not escape to shelter not into the earths bosom not into the mountains wood not into the seas bottom go where she will for this day have patience in each woe
9310658 remember hrothgar kin of healfdene gold friend of men wise king now that i am ready to start what we have spoken of if i in your service lose my life that you will be in position of my father be a protector of my warriors my comrades if war takes me also beloved hrothgar send the treasure you gave me to hygelac king of the geats that he may perceive from the gold beholding the treasure that i found a virtuous ring giver who i enjoyed while i could and give unferth my old heirloom my splendid wavy sword widely known among men to have a hard edge i will do my glory work with hrunting or death will take me
9310659 behold son of healfdene lord of the danes we have brought you with pleasure this sea booty as token of glory which you see here i hardly survived the battle under the water engaged in that deed with difficulty the battle would have ended quickly if god had not protected me nor could i accomplish anything with hrunting that strong weapon but the ruler of men granted me to see a beautiful old mighty sword hanging on the wall he often guides a man devoid of friends i drew that weapon cut in that conflict the house guardians when i saw the chance that ornamented sword burned up as the blood sprang i carried the hilt away from the enemies the deeds of crime the slaughter of the danes has been avenged as it was right to do i promise you that you and your warriors may sleep in herot free from care and every warrior of your tribe old men and young you need not prince of the danes fear for them death of your warriors from that side as you did before
9310660 lo this he may say who does truth and right among the people remembers things far distant an old guardian this is the best born man my friend beowulf your renown is established beyond the wide ways yours over all the nations hold it steady might with minds wisdom i shall carry out my friendship as we two spoke before you shall prove a long lasting relief to your people a help to fighters heremod was not so to the offspring of ecgwela the honorable danes he waxed not to their help but to their slaughter for the destruction of the danish people enraged he cut down his table companions his bosom friends until he went about alone away from the joy of life among men a notorious prince although almighty god had raised his strength advanced it over all men his spirit his heart grew blood thirsty he gave no rings to danes who pursued glory joyless he went on struggling on as a long lasting affliction learn from this and understand manly virtues i old and wise in winters tell you this for your sake it is wonderful to say how mighty god through his wisdom and large heart distributes land and rank to the race of men he controls all sometimes out of love he gives a man wisdom great among his kin gives him a home the joy of the earth gives him control of a fortress of men a wide kingdom in the world so that the man in his un wisdom does not think about the end he lives in plenty neither disease nor age live with him his mind is not darkened with evil worries nor does enmity bring about war all the world turns to his will he does not know worse but then arrogance grows the guardian of his soul sleeps that sleep is too heavy bound with affliction and the killer very near who shoots his bow with evil intent then he is hit in the heart beneath his armor with a bitter arrow he cannot guard himself against the perverse commands of his accursed spirit then what he has long held seems too little angry minded he covets never proudly giving gold rings and he forgets and neglects the future state because god the ruler of glory has given him a great deal of honors in the end it comes to pass that the body on loan declines falls fated another who recklessly dispenses treasure one who does not hold it in terror seizes the warriors ancient possessions beloved beowulf best of warriors protect yourself against that wickedness and choose better eternal councils do not heed arrogance famous champion now is your strength famous for awhile soon after it shall happen that disease or the swords edge shall cut off your strength or maybe the fires embrace or the floods welling or the grip of the sword or the arrows flight or dire age bright eyes do diminish and go dark straightway death will overpower you warrior thus i have ruled under the clouds the prosperous danes a hundred half years and by war have protected them against many nations throughout this middle earth with spears and edges so that under heavens expanse i could think of no enemies lo a reverse came to me in my home sadness after joy when the old adversary grendel invaded i have continually carried worry over that visitation therefore thanks to the creator the eternal lord that i have remained in life to gaze with my eyes at the blood stained head after that old contention go now to your seat feast in joy you who are distinguished in battle we shall share a great many treasures before morning comes
9310661 hold you now earth what warriors could not lo from you first it was taken war death has seized my people none of them can bear a sword hold an ornamented cup they have gone elsewhere now shall the hard helmet and its golden ornaments fall their owners sleep in death those who once wore the war mask so it is with the coat of mail which stood amid crashing shields held off the bite of iron it lies falling to pieces like the warrior who owned it never again will that armor travel far on a war chief by the side of heroes there is no joy in the song no pleasure in the harp no hawk sweeps over the hall no horse gallops in the courtyard death has sent off many men
9310662 often in youth i survived the storm of battle the time of war i remember all that i was seven winters old when my father took me to the king of the people hrethal gave me treasure and feasting remembering kinship i wasnt more hateful to him than any son in his house than one of his children herebeald haethcyn or my hygelac the eldest was by a kinsmans deed strewn on the bed of death haethcyn struck his lord and brother with the arrow from a bow missed the mark and killed his kinsman with a bloody arrow that was a feud that couldnt be fought weary it is to the heart that prince lost his life unavenged that felt just as it does for an old man to await the swinging of his son on the gallows he sings a mournful song when his son hangs a feast to ravens and though old and wise he cannot help every morning calls to mind the journey of his son to elsewhere the father cares not to wait for the other heirs when he has through an unavoidable death experienced an evil sorrow is in the home the wine hall abandoned bereft of joy the riders sleep warriors in the grave there is no harp song no joy in the court not as there once was comes then from the bedstead a song of sorrow the house and fields seem too large
9310663 when that sorrow befell hrethal he gave up the joys of men and chose gods light he left to his offspring a land and a people then were accusations across the water severe hostility from the war like sons of ongentheow they would have nothing of friendship but around hreosnaburg planned a terrible slaughter my kinsmen avenged that the feud and crime as is well known though one paid with his life a hard bargain for haethcyn the battle was fatal and ive heard tell how another kinsman attacked his slayer with swords edge when ongentheow sought eofor he found his helmet split fell down battle pale i repaid hygelac for the favors hed shown lands and a house with my bright sword he neednt look for a worse man i went alone in the front and will so ever as long as this sword lasts which has served me so well i was the killer of daghrefin the huga champion he brought no treasures back from the battle to the frisian king but died in the fight that banner guardian a prince in bravery nor was my sword his death but my hand grasp broke his bone house tore out his surging heart now shall the swords edge hands and hard sword fight over this hoard
9310664 i ventured many battles in my youth now old i will seek another try again for glorious deeds if that avenger will come out
9310665 i would not use a sword against this monster if i might otherwise fight as i did with grendel but how else fight fire a breath of poison therefore i wear shield and mail i will not back a step away from that hoard guardian we two shall end as fate decrees i am brave in mind so i go against the war flyer in no need of further boasting you men wait on the hill protect the war gear and see which will after the death rush come away unwounded this is not your duty nor in the power of man no one but myself can fight this monster your lord shall either win the treasure or lose his life
9310666 i remember the times we drank mead and how we promised our lord there in the beer hall he who gave us gifts that we would repay all his largess the helmets and hard swords if the need should ever befall he chose his best men for this expedition gave us honor and these treasures because he considered us best among spear fighters though he proposed to do the job alone because he had performed the most famous deeds among men now has the day come that our lord is in need of fighters of good warriors let us go to him help the war chief in this fire horror god knows to me my lord means more than my skin with him i will embrace the fire it isnt proper that we bare shields back to our homes before we can defend our lord and kill the enemy he doesnt deserve to suffer alone we two shall share the sword and helmet the mail and war garment
9310667 dear beowulf may you accomplish all well as you did in youth as i have heard tell dont surrender the glory of your life defend now with all your strength your brave deeds i will help
9310668 now should i give my sons my battle garments but fate did not grant that i have sons i ruled the people fifty winters not one king among the neighboring peoples dared greet me with a sword i feared no one i awaited my destiny well never did i plot a quarrel never did i swear an unjust oath i take joy in this despite a mortal wound the ruler of mankind will not charge that i murdered a kinsman when my life departs this body go quickly wiglaf examine the hoard under the gray stone now that the dragon lies sleeping of a wound bereft of his treasure be in haste so that i may see the ancient treasure may examine the curious gems so that i may more cheerfully give up my life and country
9310669 i thank the wonder king the ruler of all that i could win this for my people before my death day i have traded my old life for the peoples needs i cannot remain bid my warriors raise a splendid mound on the shore cliffs after my funeral fire that a remembrance shall tower high on hronesness sea farers shall afterward call it beowulfs mound when they pilot ships far over the oceans mists
9310670 you are the last remnant of our kin of the waegmundings fate has swept the rest away those courageous warriors i follow them
9310671 lo this will he say who wishes to speak the truth that lord of men gave you treasures the war equipment you stand in at the ale bench he often gave you hall sitters helmets and armor the most splendid he could find far or near he completely wasted that armor when war came he couldnt boast of warriors still god granted victory to him that he alone avenged himself with sword when he needed help i could do little in battle though i undertook it it was beyond my measure but i struck the foe and fire gushed less strongly from his head there were too few men around the prince when he faced his time of need now shall the treasure the sword gifts and delightful homes given to your people cease you will lose your land rights when men far and wide hear of your flight your shameful doings death is better to any man than a life of disgrace
9310672 now is the joy giver of the geat people still on his death bed his slaughter couch through the deeds of the dragon beside him lies his life enemy sick from a dagger wound his sword could not in any way wound the monster wiglaf son of weohstan sits by beowulf one warrior by another in the death watch now may the people expect a time of war when the franks and frisians learn of our kings fall a hard quarrel was made with the hugas when hygelac went traveling in ships to the land of the frisians attacked the hetware with a larger army they brought down that warrior he fell among his troops he gave no gifts to his warriors since then the mereovingians have given us no kindness nor do i expect kindness from the swedes it is widely known that haethcyn son of hrethel wounded ongentheow near ravenswood when the geats arrogantly sought war against the swedes quickly ongentheow old and terrible gave a counterblow cut down haethcyn and rescued his wife that aged woman bereft of her gold the mother of onela and ohthere ongentheow pursued his enemies lordless they escaped into ravenswood and those survivors weary with wounds were besieged by a huge army often through the night that wretched band heard threats how in the morning he would with the sword cut them open or hang them from trees a sport for birds help came to them with the early dawn when hygelac sounded his trumpet came up the road with picked warriors the bloody tracks were widely seen the bloody feud between geats and swedes ongentheow was forced to seek higher ground the old man with his kinsmen he quickly learned of hygelacs war did not believe he could not withstand the war of the sailors the old man retreated with his children and wife behind an earth wall hygelac attacked the refuge overran the enclosure there was ongentheow gray haired brought to bay with the edges of swords he was forced to submit to the judgement of eofor wulf hit him angrily struck him with sword so that blood sprang out of his veins out under his hair but that old man was not daunted he quickly repaid that blow with a harder nor could wulf return the blow for ongentheow had sheared his helmet so that wulf bowed to the earth covered with blood he was hurt though not yet doomed as his brother lay eofor with his broad sword an ancient sword made by giants broke ongentheows helmet that king shepherd of his people bowed mortally wounded wulf was bound up they controlled the slaughter place one warrior plundered another they took from ongentheow his iron mail his hard sword and his helmet also they carried the old mans armor to hygelac he received these weapons and promised treasures to his people which he fulfilled paying wulf and eofor for the storm of battle gave them both land and treasures nor should any man throughout this world reproach those gifts they were earned in war and to eofor hygelac gave his only daughter as a pledge of friendship that is the feud the deadly hostility for which i expect the swedes will attack when they learn our lord who long protected over hoard and kingdom is dead that most valiant of warriors will no longer look after the needs of our people will do no more heroic deeds now should we hurry to see our king and bring him back to a funeral pyre not a little will melt with that bold man but a huge treasure countless wealth bought with grimness by that brave man all that the flames will eat the fire embrace no warrior will carry any of it as a token no beautiful woman will wear a neck ring but bereft of gold they shall walk in a foreign country now that our lord has forgotten laughter and joy now shall the spear be raised clasped in hands many a cold morning now no sound of harp shall wake the warrior but the voice of the dark raven eager over the doomed speaking to the eagle of how the meals are how he rifles corpses beside the wolf
9310673 often must a warrior suffer for anothers mistake as has happened here nor could we convince our beloved prince that he should not attack that gold keeper but let him lie alone in his cave until the worlds end he grasped his high fate the hoard is open grimly bought that fate was too cruel to which our king was impelled i went inside saw all the treasure the precious things i didnt enter in a friendly way i hastily grasped many things in my hands carried out many of the hoarded treasures to my lord he was alive still sound in mind that aged man sorrowfully said many things he wanted you to build on the site of his pyre a high mound great and glorious since he was among warriors the most magnificent famous throughout the world we should now hasten to see the curious gems the wonders under the earth i will show you the way make the pyre ready so that we may bring our lord to the place he will abide in the keeping of the all powerful
9310674 now shall fire eat the flourishing dark flames the ruler of warriors he who often braved the rain of iron the storming of arrows hard from bows the sturdy shaft swift on feathered wings

9310781 wasnt really meant to be seen however its really not that exciting its gotten kind of blown out of proportion
9310782 which records would you pick if you went on a desert island
9310783 which record would you listen to if the universe was about to explode in ten minutes
9310784 the differences on the core issues are still very wide

9310786 the woman was badly bruised and required medical attention for his role buzaglo was paid 2000
9310787 we would meet in a regular meeting place and get our assignments every thursday we would be on alert
9310788 i bought a club so that i would have an easier time breaking bones some used irons the job only get carried out after hard evidence was gathered we would collect the evidence and there was a hotline as well
9310789 you would have children misbehaving an example would be this married woman who was sleeping around and cheating on her husband so we closed in on her and beat her this one time i came up to a woman and broke two of her bones for two bones we would get 1 600 and divide it amongst ourselves there was this one case where the guy was big and had big bones we got 3 300 because he was a harder case
9310790 i joined two years ago and i left we would film people going to gay clubs in tel aviv with either a cell phone or a digital camera the squad always looked for the ones running off to tel aviv because they thought that they were safe there but they didnt know that we were onto them always
9310791 there was one guy in the neighborhood we had information that he had porn films in his possession and that he would sell the films to other people we immediately locked onto him we followed him to where he was having dinner one thursday we broke two of his bones
9310792 we would go into orthodox chat rooms and forums those places are like sodom and gomorrah there was a lot of sex chat i pretended to play along and i met a married woman who was looking for men our goal was to get to the persons in charge of the forum through her we started beating her but she denied that she had anything to do with running the site we believed her and the chat room is still operational
9310793 a lot of our guys would fly abroad and get donations for our cause and come back a lot of dollars
9310794 its role then was more explanatory what you can or cannot buy what the right length for a skirt is how to dress and what to wear in the 1970s the committees activity went up a notch they would call you and tell you that your wife is dressed in an improper way thats how they would let people know and they have been doing that ever since
9310795 as is the case with any society even the orthodox have violent people and there are those who are just agitators
9310796 mr meirovich is denying any allegations made against him he gave his statement to the police and was subsequently released with the polices consent and with some limitations
9310797 an investigation is being carried out in regards to this subject a number of people have been arrested and some will be brought up on charges
9310798 i dont feel any different im just having fun with this
9310799 i never said i have a girlfriend and i never said i dont have a girlfriend my public and private life are separate i keep my private life to myself
9310800 he is a sociable dad and just likes hanging out with his boys maybe he is also getting them in the swing of things so they can take over the business when they get older
9310801 birlas contribution to the development of our country is immense he was a multifaceted personality he ranks among the greatest industrial leaders that india has produced his efforts for the promotion of technical education and hindi literature in the country received wide acclaim
9310802 birlas passing away is a great loss to our country he leaves behind a void that will be difficult to fill i extend my heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved family and to the wide circle of his friends admirers and associates i pray for the peace of the departed soul
9310803 police and prosecutors have shared the grief of families but have so often been unable to seek justice for the full offense
9310804 we think there are several types of value to this law
9310805 one is deterrence hopefully people will take this into account when they beat up on a woman
9310806 he had a name he was loved and his life was violently taken from him before he ever saw the sun
9310807 the concept of a fetus or unborn child as a potential victim of violence is neither obscure nor difficult to grasp
9310808 congress made it evident that the protections of federal criminal law may be extended to an unborn crime victim
9310809 east asia pollution aerosols could impose far reaching environmental impacts at continental hemispheric and global scales because of long range transport
9310810 this is very challenging science with lots of complexities and a lot of uncertainties
9310811 this pollution is distributed on average equally from northern california to british columbia
9310812 anyone who has gone out to measure it has found something
9310813 people assumed the atmosphere scrubbed itself and didnt believe these pollutants could travel thousands of miles
9310814 air pollution is not a local or regional problem it is a global problem
9310815 i think what he learned from the 2000 primary was to fight back and not take anything for granted
9310816 thats why when obama said that john would use that obama doesnt look like the other presidents on dollar bills and that he had a funny last name that john didnt let that go unaddressed
9310817 i find myself surprised by some of the tactics that ive seen in the last few weeks
9310818 they dont seem like the tactics of the john mccain i know
9310819 i responded by getting angry on the stump and running negative ads about my opponent that only raised the toxic level of the primary
9310820 we should have refuted the above the radar attacks in our own ads challenged bushs positions and in my speeches stuck to the message of reform and patriotism
9310821 i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land
9310822 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
9310823 mccain coming in to some of those districts in the weekend before the election was the margin of error largely allowing us to keep the house of representatives
9310824 in marginal seats this wasnt a hard right guy he was the acceptable guy this wasnt bush mccain was the good housekeeping seal of approval
9310825 hes a soldier this is a guy who was beaten up for years at a pow camp and was one of the first lawmakers to call for the recognition of vietnam
9310826 he can get angry but he gets over it and at the end of the day he reconciles just as he did with the vietnamese and bush
9310827 i think a lot of his actions in 2001 to 2003 when he was actively opposing the president were rooted in south carolina
9310828 he shoved campaign finance down the presidents throat and he opposed the tax cuts
9310829 they needed each other bush needed mccain and his great appeal among moderate voters and mccain needed to show conservatives that he was doing everything to get bush re elected
9310830 i thought he was a lot more naive in 2000 he had kind of a cotton candy and ice cream campaign
9310831 in 2008 he was much more willing to go after his rivals romney and rudy giuliani hes learned to be a tougher campaigner
9310832 it has the side effect in manners mall of turning a space that does not work and hasnt worked for a long time into a space that will work

9310834 may 8 is the last day to file your 95 96 99 2000 2001 2002 2003 and 2004 tax returns for eitc
9310835 there is a ton of work that needs to be done but were sorting through that
9310836 i am definitely concerned about the impact it would have on the business people come and sit outside to eat their lunch on a nice day they are not going to do that with buses going past
9310837 get rid of the little hooligans that hang around the mall
9310838 i dont see how a bus route in manners mall will improve the areas image
9310839 on lambton quay nearly all the pedestrians use the footpath on the cable car side what would be the preferred pedestrian side and what would be the dead side

9310913 the album happened accidentally actually i was composing songs along with my band for an untitled album a passing thought about mankind and the supernatural power gave me an idea to compose something in the name of god so we all screamed bismillah

9311065 we are not ready to make that decision yet we are first going to go to the regional consultations we will then establish the criteria and then thats the time we will really decide who to field
9311066 the other factor you must look into is the winnability and i think its a well known fact that chairman bf and even sen dick gordon are trailing but that doesnt mean that we cant adopt them who knows its too early but we are flexing our muscles

9311146 people forget that we have bought robbie keane and paid a huge fee for javier mascherano so the commitment has still been there they have been supportive through this transfer window and at the moment it is stable
9311147 obstacles are things you see when you take your eyes off the goal
9311148 lord help me walk in your blessed path by keeping to your word despite the difficulties and challenges that come
9311149 mi ha impressionato in questo viaggio bis soprattutto la sensazione di non cambiamento

9311151 being an ordained minister doesnt only mean being a vicar in the traditional sense
9311152 what it does mean though is that the kind of intense concentration and training the excellent standards that we expect of ordained ministers as they have existed for the last few decades are there but we look for more flexibility and for the ability to go where people are
9311153 true im not so choosy ill be there shall i be lady margaret do you think are they that sort of people
9311154 i suspect theyd be less likely to invite you but i dont know them very well yet
9311155 bring robin too if you like theres to be nursery tea as well
9311156 its all right we dont have to watch feeding time at the zoo there will be nurses aplenty to scrub their jammy faces but the little jessup girl adores the twins and mrs jessup mrs aidan jessup is very motherly so i thought it would please her
9311157 you want to please mrs aidan jessup what are you up to daisy
9311158 i believe so the elder mrs jessup was moira callaghan when she was on the stage
9311159 and irish have you moved in next door to a nest of republicans
9311160 not at all aidan is frightfully english in spite of his name so is his father in spite of all his travels on the continent its the younger son irish republican i hadnt even considered that possibility i think hes in america not ireland
9311161 ill come early and you can tell me all about it
9311162 right oh yes id better ring off now or alecs going to be asking nasty questions about the telephone bill cheerio darling
9311163 we regret to say that it appears that morne experimented with
9311164 so the entire class could find out what kim felt was so important it couldnt wait until after class
9311165 sarah mrs meningers hair is so thin that you can see right through it can you imagine how much uglier she would be if she were bald
9311166 protecting the polar bears is something we are committed to but we going to base it on science and with input and collaboration with inuit and northern people
9311167 even though it is john mccains 72nd birthday it looks like barack obama and joe biden got the best gift with mccains choice of sarah palin to be mccains running mate in an election mccain claims is about experience and security he picks someone who barely has the equivalent of a learners permit in elected office let alone foreign affairs she has served well under two years as governor and her prior experience as a mayor of a town with 9 000 people does not qualify her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
9311168 americas working families want change they want leaders with a proven record of standing up for better wages health care for all retirement security fair trade deals that value jobs here at home and for rebuilding our middle class through green jobs that pay a living wage they want the chance to better themselves through union representation without facing illegal employer harassment
9311169 governor palins lack of experience and thin record give us no choice but to return to the clear facts that john mccain has a long and terrible record of failing americas workers mccains record is a train wreck for families who want a shot at the american dream and this choice his first as a presidential candidate shows a serious lack of judgment and understanding about what this election is about
9311170 thats why change to win members are so excited about the obama biden ticket were in our sixth month of backing a candidate who has the vision and leadership to make real change for all of americas working families obama had the wisdom to pick a partner with over 30 years of experience in foreign affairs and who has always stood on the side of workers in the fight for good jobs retirement with dignity and the opportunity to leave a better life for their children that is why we are proud and excited to continue to knock on thousands of doors visit thousands of worksites and make millions of phone calls to educate our members and turn out an historic vote this november
9311171 another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9311172 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9311173 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies but the fact that she uh will soon be nominated uh is one more indicator of this country moving forward uh one more hit against that glass ceiling i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9311174 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9311175 i believe we now have the most pro life ticket in history running on the most pro life platform in history gov palins credentials as a leader include taking on political corruption and reducing spending but her promises of change were not just words they became actions and her concern for country has been passed down to her five children her oldest son track joined the army last year on the sixth anniversary of the september 11th attacks and is serving his country all conservatives should be proud to support this historic ticket of proven reformers with records of self sacrifice for their country and their families
9311176 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table
9311177 in the case of both biden and obamas family whats interesting is that the gentlemen in the family left in 1849 and then their families followed in 1850
9311178 what is even more peculiar is that both of the progenitors were shoemakers
9311179 n o one comes to the father except through me
9311180 do you know allison scagliotti can you get me her number
9311181 uh i guess i dont have anything to lose by doing that sure
9311182 ooooohhhhh neat is there a way i contact her too you know send her fan mail and junk
9311183 i know that bishop mccormack has great confidence in the physicians nurses and staff at catholic medical center
9311184 i ask that we all join in praying for a speedy recovery for the bishop and that the lord will guide those who are caring for him
9311185 its a good location and although attendance has been down its been a good organization for the league
9311186 you certainly could be cited for reckless operation speeding or a construction zone violation
9311187 the law is a reminder its really just safe driving practices
9311188 slowing down and moving away from the scene of a roadside incident should be common sense but not enough drivers do it
9311189 these additions to the move over law will provide protection to a larger group of emergency responders and members of the public
9311190 i think the signs have gotten a lot of attention
9311191 but something like this takes a while to catch on
9311192 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9311193 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9311194 we will be showing the work of two well known gifted professional artists for the first time in our gallery dean diggins of kittery piece shown and colin berry of hampton
9311195 the bottom line is that in the last 10 or 11 years football has grown significantly in this state its booming right now
9311196 anytime you get more teams involved thats a good thing overall i think that this is good for new hampshire football
9311197 i really dont know how this is all going to work out
9311198 i know i liked playing hanover and laconia i prefer it when there are five or six teams fighting to get into the playoffs late in the season thats kind of fun
9311199 its probably going to take half the season before i know whether i like the change or not
9311200 the same with three and four and five and six you could have a north and a south and have the champion from each league play each other for the state title you could make it like a bowl game
9311201 i liked playing plymouth because you always strive to beat the best
9311202 i suppose some of this was done out of a concern for the cost of transportation but thats not something i have to worry about i just concern myself with who were going to play and whats in our division
9311203 the six divisions will give more teams a chance to make the playoffs
9311204 i also think its going to make the competition level
9311205 the best thing about all of this is that we can realign every two years
9311206 the fact that we have the number of players that we do gives us more depth
9311207 the importance of depth is something we noticed when we were in division ii and we were looking across the field at teams with 60 or 70 players back then if we got an injury we were often in bad shape
9311208 we were hoping to bring in at least 20 from newmarket so we fell short of that
9311209 i think a lot of it is fear of the unknown
9311210 some people say we would have been a playoff team in division vi but i see it differently
9311211 if you want to be a high level team you have to play high level competition we dont want to back down from competition
9311212 even though he was a freshman he was the quarterback for our jv team last season
9311213 hes got a pretty good arm hes gonna be a better passer than ryan
9311214 as always depth is a concern you cant avoid all injuries i think forming a co op team and staying in division v will force us to get better faster
9311215 were inexperienced in the offensive backfield but we do have six or seven guys there well need to play as a unit defensively
9311216 weve been more consistent than we were last year in doing things the right way
9311217 we have experience at qb and receiver we have better athletes across the board than we had last year time will tell whether or not that translates into victories on the field
9311218 i do think were going to be able to throw the ball we have a few kids who could fill in but were not real deep this team is on par with some of our recent teams but we have to get better
9311219 well have to be much better defensively than we were last year if were going to make the playoffs we gave up too many big plays last season and we werent as physical as we should be the offense is going to take time because were young
9311220 we think we have some kids who can play but varsity experience is our biggest question mark we have to take some strides but making the playoffs is our goal we have some kids with high expectations
9311221 if we stay healthy were capable of winning five or six games this year
9311222 the league seems to be coming down and we seem to be moving up
9311223 were loaded with skill kids especially at running back we have a lot of depth there the attitude has been tremendous but we still have some gears we havent found yet
9311224 i was like you gotta be kidding me hows it going to work
9311225 sometimes the door on a police car can be a barrier to communication
9311226 were finding that police are talking to more people than they ever have
9311227 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9311228 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9311229 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9311230 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9311231 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9311232 so there we were 14 of us in the family section and the vendor came through selling cracker jack
9311233 it was the fourth inning and suddenly the song was in my head buy me some peanuts and cracker jack and it sounded good
9311234 first of all you dont get any peanuts until you get to the bottom of the bag and you only get six of them
9311235 i was making it out to be this big thing i remember years ago the prize would be a little secret decoder ring or a toy of some kind or a baseball card i guess those days are gone
9311236 his pants were still there on the side of the road
9311237 he gets fuel for his car and its great for us because we are able to recycle it and put it to good use
9311238 there is a display inside that teaches kids the proper body mechanics when riding a four wheeler
9311239 there is also a ride inside for the kids thats fun but also educational
9311240 when i had a gas vehicle i had to get reimbursed for mileage
9311241 with gas prices being the way they are we couldnt do as many events as we would have liked to do
9311242 now its easier and more cost effective to bring the safety trailer to different events
9311243 if i can get the oil for free it costs only 20 cents per gallon to heat it up and filter it
9311244 once you get the oil you have to filter out all the particles before you can use it
9311245 last year we attended the seafood festival and saw all the used vegetable oil and i thought wow i can use that
9311246 its great because its someone who is local using cooking oil to fuel his car for a good cause
9311247 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9311248 has a vision for change for the country versus barack obamss rhetoric
9311249 how much enthusiasm can you gin up by dumping on the other guy
9311250 and you know its great that its the u s open
9311251 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9311252 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9311253 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
9311254 it was a dream come true and my life turned 180 degrees in one night
9311255 i think sometimes when things arent working at this level teams really can make you pay
9311256 but at the same time when it turns around and it clicks it can be pretty good
9311257 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
9311258 the way we view him and how we value him hasnt changed
9311259 the biggest thing for a player is to learn what their abilities are and what are their limits and to make the adjustments with the lines
9311260 for all his struggles hes had this year hes actually a better pitcher than he was last year
9311261 its a matter of believing you can succeed at that level
9311262 i just didnt believe i was going to succeed every time i went out in the big leagues its hard to go out there and succeed if you dont believe youre going to
9311263 to be around adam just gave you this euphoric happy feeling
9311264 he made us all better people i think our family is an example of his impact
9311265 my closeness with adam makes me have a huge drive to make this festival go off every year without a hitch
9311266 that was a nice thing for us to feel like the community embraced us and adam
9311267 his impact was quite profound down at the high school
9311268 we started the festival in honor of adam to raise money and try to give back to the local community for people with abilities and disabilities
9311269 it means a lot to my uncle bill and erica and it means a lot to me and the rest of the family
9311270 i hope that a family can come and just relax and have some good food listen to music have some entertainment and everybody can feel like theyre having a great day
9311271 i took the orders because it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to be on the boat named after my state
9311272 it was one of my goals it was important to me to represent new hampshire
9311273 i take every opportunity i can to come up there
9311274 so i have a pretty good understanding of how things work
9311275 so your responsibility is greater you have to have a pretty full knowledge of the sub
9311276 its hard on the family for me to go out to sea
9311277 its difficult for her she knows the drill and she accepts it but its not easy
9311278 everything talks to each other and theres always a backup if one individual thing fails it doesnt limit us theres a lot of redundancy
9311279 you have to have an idea of whats going on everywhere so you know who to talk to to get the job fixed
9311280 because being on the new hampshire and from new hampshire is pretty cool
9311281 the commissioning looks like its going to be pretty exciting im looking forward to coming up there and spending some time at home
9311282 from the time the submarine was a little bit of scaffolding to what it is now
9311283 we have interfaced directly with the trades at electric boat to test the systems as they were completed meanwhile were getting training and studying the books thats why i put in the request i want to learn all i can about her
9311284 it took a while for jessica to get used to it
9311285 going away for months at a time with limited communication and i know its hard on her and my mom too she worries about me but shes my mom thats her job
9311286 it had always been a contingency of mine i had a good feeling that i could learn skills that would help me later on
9311287 weve been certified paperless so we dont have to navigate on paper the computers do everything for you
9311288 truthfully i had no idea where this was going when i started
9311289 last year i came up with a three tine hand held cultivator i showed them down at johnnys seeds and now i have orders for 800
9311290 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal just words we have nothing to fear but fear itself just words just speeches
9311291 i am not asking anybody to take a chance on me im asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
9311292 im not just asking you to take a chance on me im also asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
9311293 if there is a child on the south side of chicago who cant read that matters to me even if its not my child
9311294 it is that fundamental belief i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper that makes this country work its what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one american family
9311295 we believe we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another that the problems of a retired school teacher in duluth are our problems that the future of the child in buffalo is our future that the struggle of a disabled man in boston to survive and live decently is our struggle that the hunger of a woman in little rock is our hunger that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might to avoid pain is our failure
9311296 but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place america that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before
9311297 and they too had big dreams for their daughter a common dream born of two continents my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they werent rich because in a generous america you dont have to be rich to achieve your potential theyre both passed away now and yet i know that on this night they look down on me with great pride
9311298 i watched a small man with thick calluses on both his hands work 15 and 16 hours a day i saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet a man who came here uneducated alone unable to speak the language who taught me all i needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example i learned about our kind of democracy from my father and i learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother they asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children and they they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves this nation and this nations government did that for them
9311299 and that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in south jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state in the greatest nation in the only world we would know is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process
9311300 we have more work to do more work to do for the workers i met in galesburg illinois who are losing their union jobs at the maytag plant thats moving to mexico and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour more to do for the father that i met who was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay 4 500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on more to do for the young woman in east st louis and thousands more like her who has the grades has the drive has the will but doesnt have the money to go to college
9311301 maybe mr president if you visited some more places maybe if you went to appalachia where some people still live in sheds maybe if you went to lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel maybe mr president if you stopped in at a shelter in chicago and spoke to the homeless there maybe mr president if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we couldnt afford to use
9311302 maybe if john mccain went to pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job but cant even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one hed understand we cant afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators
9311303 maybe if he went to iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still cant pay the medical bills for his sister whos ill hed understand she cant afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy
9311304 i havent spent most of my life in politics as most of you know but ive spent enough time in washington to know how much we need to change washington
9311305 i havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington but ive been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change
9311306 we always find ourselves in that spot i think our parents understand our costs really have remained pretty consistent
9311307 you add 20 students to the school and as long as it was spread out among the grades we wouldnt have to hire any new staff
9311308 it is truly a factor of the number of students in the school
9311309 i was in the back of the suite doing something
9311310 it was great to come in the dome and throw out a couple of touchdowns o line blocked just great
9311311 we didnt play our best were going to have to play better
9311312 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9311313 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9311314 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9311315 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9311316 its not going to change its not a family show
9311317 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9311318 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9311319 im not going to get involved with anybody or anything that could be construed as assisted suicide
9311320 its a legal constraint on me but i am determined to obey the law for the rest of my career
9311321 i dont feel guilty i just feel regret for the stress its caused my patients and my family
9311322 the subject comes up from time to time and people express their views
9311323 i feel it would be appropriate to have a system allowing people control of the end of their life
9311324 that would have to have significant safeguards so that vulnerable people were not disadvantaged the worry is that a person feels they are a burden to their families and might feel coerced into taking part in assisted suicide
9311325 i know the politicians have a lot of other things to consider but i think this is important
9311326 loyalty is only to the muslim not to the kaffir disbeliever

9311335 if anyone wants to become my follower let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me

9311348 high end restaurants have been hit more than anyone else whereas before wed have many chinese bringing their business partners in now its a total slowdown from what i hear some high end places are between 20 50 down
9311349 everything was looking so rosy we were so excited we were anticipating a lot of guests coming through shanghai before and after the olympics
9311350 expectations were really high and everyone just thought that millions of people would be coming to china in june july and august
9311351 compared to last summer have had a drop in sales
9311352 i do believe there are a lot of people who cant return to china in the last few months i have had at least one goodbye party nearly every day in my restaurants
9311353 im hurt but i can live with it 5 10 percent down no big deal
9311354 i see a big drop as a supplier high end hotels and restaurants are purchasing less than they were supposed to in general we are seeing quite a huge decrease in terms of purchases
9311355 many people would sooner die than think in fact they do so
9311356 in all affairs its a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted

9311361 alistair darling he says that the economic times are the worst theyve been in 60 years when the chancellor says that it must be bad
9311362 im sure hes got some political reason for saying that dont worry about it

9311454 much of my research is about tree rings and forest change in an effort to understand landscapes
9311455 in both projects im interested in how the surrounding forests have changed over time which is largely in response to how jefferson and washington used the environment two centuries ago
9311456 there are lots of woods you can look at in virginia but its fun to get to work at mount vernon and monticello
9311457 its not only environmental history but the history of our country
9311458 hopefully this research will help to shed some light on the timing of the field clearing since the foundation wants to reconstruct the appearance to that of thomas jeffersons retirement years
9311459 the goal of his work is to reconstruct the history of the development of the forested areas about 60 to 70 percent of the estate
9311460 those results will be significant in terms of adding to historical evidence that we have available to interpret the site but they will have management applications as well we are committed to preserving all of mount vernons significant cultural and natural resources

9311475 if i disagree with you on any point you need to be silenced
9311476 please explain to me when im too hard on my callers
9311477 well when people call in who dont know about something and you know they want to find out something

9311486 a disastrous combination gt of investigative zeal and substantive ignorance
9311487 when it comes to this particular threat to human rights human gt rights commissions just dont get it
9311488 human rights commissions like generals are fighting the last war gt they do not see new threats until they are overwhelmed by them if gt out of generosity than for no other reason we should assume ignorance gt rather than wilful blindness then the remedy is education and gt training
9311489 successfully hijacked un institutions gt to impose its own radicalized agenda
9311490 neither the conservatives nor the liberals have any interest in this gt their effort is to appease these islamist groups they dont wish to gt offend and therefore the islamists can walk over and literally gt blackmail politicians and the liberal intelligentsia into not saying a gt word about it
9311491 those who advocate freedom of expression often go on to deny the gt equal right to be protected from advocacy of hatred the holocaust gt did not begin with censorship it began with hate speech auschwitz gt was built with words the killing fields of cambodia were sowed with gt slogans the genocide of rwanda was spread by radio bosnia was gt ethnically cleansed by television
9311492 the time constraints on me and resource constraints too meant i gt havent been able to do anything comprehensively so what ive really gt aimed to do is just make sure i spoke to a representative group gt those who have grave reservations and those who support the idea so gt that i would hopefully get the full range of perspective
9311493 our overall conclusion is that condemnation of human rights laws gt jurisdiction over hate has become surrogate for criticism which is gt more properly directed elsewhere to abusive complaints lack of gt training for human rights commission staff and procedural flaws in gt the system

9311559 from time to time we are going to have a glitch but its a tradeoff
9311560 would i like to see more modern equipment in the system sure but most folks would not want to see their taxes tripled to pay for new technology every two years
9311561 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9311562 although the vod markets are at an early stage of development it is already clear that there is a significant level of competition at all levels
9311563 while market entry itself is not difficult the strength of competition in the market and the diverse business models adopted by the various players means that success is highly uncertain
9311564 we simply cannot see why the kangaroo parties need to create a joint venture in order to produce a viable internet vod service
9311565 if a joint venture of the three biggest broadcasters in the uk were to go ahead it would have untold consequences on a nascent internet vod market
9311566 if the market is taken over in this way it would make it difficult for any other such enterprise to compete
9311567 would almost eliminate competition in the provision of online vod services for long form non user generated programming
9311568 inability to obtain content from the joint ventures parents on reasonable commercial terms is a key issue limiting its ability to compete in the uk which could well be exacerbated by the increased incentives of the parents to favour the kangaroo platform once it is operational

9311581 we are effectively a hydration company so its a business risk for us if water is not readily available whether we draw water from a municipality or extract groundwater weve really pushed ourselves to understand the full 360 on water from a watershed perspective a social context and in our plant use in india were funding rainwater capture devices and drip irrigation offsetting our use in guatemala were working to clean up a watershed that feeds into the worlds second largest marine reef and our bottling plant from 2002 to 2006 product volume increased 14 and the amount of water used to make that product decreased 6 right now 84 of the water we use to produce our products is fully treated and returned to the environment safe for aquatic life our goal is to get to 100 by 2010
9311582 i like a great hamburger as much as anyone does but once we learned that livestock operations produce 18 of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions exceeding even transportation we committed to reducing our meat consumption we moved away from industrially raised meat to natural beef burgers that have less water we found that a 4 ounce natural beef patty tastes better and cooks to the same size as a conventional 5 ounce patty if you can convince customers about the importance of what youre doing tell a story and offer great tasting food you will get higher sales that will cover a couple of percentage points in higher costs in the first nine months we cut our beef consumption 23
9311583 whole foods had required basic animal welfare in what we sold no antibiotics or hormones but felt we needed to do more we invited animal welfare groups and scientists to join us at the table with producers to tackle all the species ducks beef cattle pigs broiler chickens sheep turkeys many minds can do good work if youre intent on making something happen after five years we settled on a system that recognizes that there can be variation as well as continuous improvement to rate a 4 for example animals must have continuous access to pasture im picky about what i eat if i didnt believe in the process weve created i wouldnt be eating meat

9311790 retirar a viol ncia dom stica do rol da pequena criminalidade como se encontra actualmente de modo a permitir a deten o e pris o preventiva do agressor
9311791 nos termos da lei a viol ncia dom stica na sua forma mais simples considerada pequena criminalidade com uma moldura penal que vai de um a cinco anos de pris o agravada em dois a cinco anos quando praticada na presen a de menores ou na resid ncia do casal ou da v tima
9311792 ora a lei estipula que a pol cia n o pode deter algu m acusado de um crime que n o pass vel de pris o preventiva excepto quando em flagrante delito ou face ao risco de fuga do suspeito duas situa es que no caso da viol ncia dom stica s o extremamente raras
9311793 assim deixar de ser considerada criminalidade menor aumentando a censurabilidade social e passar a estar abrangida pela possibilidade de pris o preventiva permitindo pol cia deter o agressor mesmo quando n o h flagrante delito

9311801 i felt real bad this horse got hurt while we were down there
9311802 i treated this mans horse just like i would treat my own horse
9311803 thats what any normal trainer would have done if theyre going to put chains on a horse
9311804 in my opinion this is a classic example of a soring process that went wrong
9311805 ive got some full strength here that i paid 60 an ounce for
9311806 he was shaking his foot like he was in a lot of pain
9311807 when they called his number he couldnt hardly walk on his left front foot at all
9311808 when gary took the wraps off i was sick the horses foot had busted open
9311809 he was just standing there grunting moaning shaking his foot
9311810 he said ive never seen a worse place on a horse than that
9311811 he said if youd brought it tomorrow his foot would have been hanging
9311812 this horse had massive tissue damage to the pastern and ankle area the necrosis was so extensive that it had eaten through the tendons to the point so where the animal was unable to control normal movement there was no way of saving this horse
9311813 is theres ligaments you dont see inside the ankle here just in a matter of time this whole thing would just come off this in here was obliterated rotted out gone
9311814 the jury did not find that i did anything to that horse intentionally or deliberately
9311815 obviously the jury didnt think there was anything wrong because they didnt award any punitive damages the case is what is its public record
9311816 the kentucky state police is going to enforce the horse protection act in the commonwealth the evidence indicated further investigation was needed in white pines tenn

9311821 creo que ya tuvieron al hurac n katrina y en este momento este huracan no tiene las dimensiones del katrina de todos modos todav a es un amplio y poderoso hurac n que representa una amenaza significativa
9311822 si usted es lo suficientemente testarudo no toma esto seriamente y decide quedarse quedar abandonado a su propia suerte

9311831 contribution for cricket development notably by member sripad halbe who felt it could be a violation of tax rules but they were brushed aside
9311832 a small group myself the revenue secretary of the finance ministry and another member of the bcci have been asked to discuss the matter and if successful will benefit all sports bodies in the country the taxation rate for all sports bodies may come down to around ten or 11 per cent
9311833 it is important not to focus on the exact track of gustav as this is a large hurricane and significant impacts are likely to occur well away from the center

9311838 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are

9311841 who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge
9311842 where were you when i laid the earths undation tell me if you understand 5 who marked off its dimensions surely you know who stretched a measuring line across it 6 on what were its footings set or who laid its cornerstone 7 while the morning stars sang together and all the angels
9311843 who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb 9 when i made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness 10 when i fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place 11 when i said this far you may come and no farther here is where your proud waves halt
9311844 have you ever given orders to the morning or shown the dawn its place 13 that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it
9311845 have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep 17 have the gates of death been shown to you have you seen the gates of the shadow of death
9311846 what is the way to the abode of light and where does darkness reside 20 can you take them to their places do you know the paths to their dwellings 21 surely you know for you were already born you have lived so many years
9311847 have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail 23 which i reserve for times of trouble for days of war and battle
9311848 can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water 35 do you send the lightning bolts on their way do they report to you here we are 36 who endowed the heart
9311849 do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions 40 when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket 41 who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to god and wander about for lack of food

9311902 but not many families have chosen to go public if the surgeon has openly talked with them about what went wrong
9311903 many of us still look to the surgeon or specialist as someone on a pedestal and are reluctant to bother you its your challenge to make it very clear it is your job to be there
9311904 i have no quarrel that patients have a responsibility but i still believe the greater responsibility lies with the professional
9311905 but the public in this country has received very little information about the overall quality of health care
9311906 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9311907 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9311908 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9311909 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9311910 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9311911 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9311912 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9311913 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9311914 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9311915 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9311916 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9311917 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9311918 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9311919 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9311920 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9311921 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9311922 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9311923 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9311924 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9311925 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9311926 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9311927 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9311928 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9311929 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9311930 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9311931 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9311932 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9311933 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9311934 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9311935 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9311936 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9311937 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9311938 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9311939 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9311940 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9311941 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9311942 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9311943 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9311944 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9311945 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9311946 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9311947 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9311948 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9311949 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9311950 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9311951 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9311952 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9311953 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9311954 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9311955 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9311956 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9311957 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9311958 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9311959 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9311960 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9311961 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9311962 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9311963 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9311964 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9311965 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9311966 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9311967 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9311968 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

9312050 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
9312051 should i turn him in as a medical phenomenon and get loads of moola
9312052 actually you shouldnt be using that around your eyes because it has steroids here use these they have less steroids
9312053 scenario 2 that maps out the general route companies will follow when installing transmission lines
9312054 they want to do it at the most reasonable cost because ultimately the customers foot the bill
9312055 if we are selected by the puc to construct the project then we have a very extensive state approved public input process
9312056 i know that in past projects weve tried to minimize the disturbances to the area and use existing areas for right of ways if possible
9312057 that to me is really in conflict with home rule
9312058 we spend more time trying to do that than we do trying to make the decisions themselves
9312059 the court has reviewed these contentions and finds them to be without merit
9312060 if any transactions involve landowners who are elected or appointed officials related to the project iberdrola renewables requests the recusal of those officials from related decision making
9312061 what were trying to do is whats best for all the taxpayers not just a couple who dont approve of whats going on
9312062 but it is a great concern that you have people sitting on the town board who are leaseholders on the project
9312063 its really a sad situation i think that these kinds of contracts are basically pushed on the communities
9312064 under general municipal law that could easily be construed as unethical at a minimum and a crime at maximum
9312065 its a problem that essentially is occurring all over the state of new york
9312066 amid allegations of improper dealings with public officials and anti competitive practices
9312067 the use of wind power like all renewable energy sources should be encouraged to help clean our air and end our reliance on fossil fuels
9312068 however our public integrity remains a top priority of my office and if dirty tricks are used to facilitate even clean energy projects my office will put a stop to it
9312069 we are hardly going to look favourably on them and they dont like me because they see me as standing in the way of them earning money
9312070 it has also divided families because the son of one of my neighbours is lukewarm about having the turbines while his father is determined so they are hardly a happy lot
9312071 and no coal fired power station will be shut down by this development because they dont work when there is no wind they shut down when the wind is too strong and the power they generate cant be stored
9312072 you could put a turbine on every ridge and hill in nsw and it would not make any difference to greenhouse gas emissions because they cant store energy generated
9312073 ive been here all my life and now people ive grown up with my cousin an uncle and a neighbour have signed to have wind turbines on their properties without any real consultation with anyone
9312074 my mother is dead against these things and her brother my uncle has been promoting them
9312075 and it is so true i do like see my little programs come to live the developement cycles are quite short on mobile phones and soon after i begin programming i can see results

9312095 prior to this year my winning record was about 60 per cent which is up there with the top two or three
9312096 i hope that the way weve performed this year doesnt impact too much on my prospects

9312106 i would sit on a hay bale and pretend i was on johnny carson
9312107 the kind of men who were interested in me i did not find interesting at all
9312108 i would see him here and there and i thought he was very handsome
9312109 they would say how much money are you making amy and later i learned that he was appalled that they were asking so many questions
9312110 i thought why does she want to renovate when shes going to move in with me
9312111 i just wanted to see him but then i lost my nerve at the last minute and started to drive away
9312112 long long drives through the landscape of our shared childhoods

9312120 referendum why download the petition and ask your work colleagues neighbours friends and relatives to sign encourage people to collect their own petition take spare forms with you
9312121 the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life
9312122 at some future period not very distant as measured by centuries the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace the savage races throughout the world
9312123 he will be able to compete successfully with his bigger brained and smaller jawed rival in a contest which is to be carried out on by thoughts and not by bites
9312124 so if the races of man are to survive it is ok for us to exterminate the lower races in order for the higher races to survive
9312125 im eliminating the competition in order for my offspring to survive might makes right but we are taught that this is wrong morals have always been taught to kids so we can eliminate this behavior out of them
9312126 i just left a sporting goods store and you would think that the number one selling item would be plywood or potable water or gasoline right now

9312131 our resources from our department and our partner agencies are on standby ready to deploy with the call is necessary
9312132 whether its to evacuate or contra flow lanes are necessary those resources are on standby and are ready to go
9312133 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9312134 first you have to know with no fear that someday you are going to die until you know that you are useless
9312135 he cometido muchos errores sobre todo de derecha pero no me sorprende he luchado y lo he intentado el ha hecho su partido y he sido muy irregular

9312141 ive seen many anti welsh jokes to do with sheep mostly that have been allowed but as soon as i posted this bang

9312150 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9312151 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9312152 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9312153 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9312154 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9312155 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9312156 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9312157 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9312158 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9312159 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9312160 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9312161 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9312162 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9312163 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9312164 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9312165 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9312166 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9312167 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9312168 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9312169 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9312170 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9312171 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9312172 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9312173 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9312174 who are open to doing something on the production side
9312175 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9312176 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9312177 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9312178 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9312179 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9312180 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9312181 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9312182 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9312183 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9312184 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9312185 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9312186 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9312187 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9312188 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9312189 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9312190 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9312191 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9312192 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9312193 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9312194 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9312195 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9312196 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9312197 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9312198 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9312199 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9312200 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9312201 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9312202 you should never ever call a person stupid because once you do it will demotivate them and it will stick with them for the rest of their lives
9312203 a good leader needs to learn how to use their resources which means that a good leader must be able to bring out the best in their groups by helping each individuals realise their potential so that they will be able to contribute their best ideas
9312204 i feel inspired and will probably start my list now
9312205 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9312206 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9312207 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9312208 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9312209 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9312210 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9312211 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9312212 it is great to have the title back and i am very happy about it

9312246 es ist sch n dass wir von einer so schlechten ausgangsposition noch ein so gutes ergebnis geholt haben marcel und emanuele haben einen tollen job gemacht das gilt auch f r das team das es aufgrund der unf lle nicht leicht hatte mit einer guten teamleistung aber noch den dritten platz im gesamtklassement und einen weiteren sieg in der lmp1 erzielt hat
9312247 die strecke ist sehr schwierig ich hatte wirklich alle h nde voll zu tun damit mir der tanz zwischen den mauern gl ckt und der verkehr war hier noch schlimmer als letztes mal in road america ich bin wirklich happy emanuele hat einen super job gemacht das team war klasse und auch die reifen haben ber die ganze distanz super gehalten ich bin froh ein teil dieses teams zu sein es macht unheimlich spa
9312248 wir k nnen wirklich gl cklich sein wir haben das beste gemacht was wir auf dieser schwierigen strecke tun konnten wir sind beide gut gefahren ich war mit meinem stint sehr zufrieden f r marcel war es sehr schwierig denn wir sind vor dem rennen nicht viel gefahren aber er hat das auto nach hause gebracht und einen guten job gemacht
9312249 das war ein sehr schwieriges wochenende f r uns wir konnten kaum im trockenen fahren da ich vorher noch nie hier war musste ich erst einmal ein paar bodenwellen kennenlernen im rennen bin ich dann auf eine der bodenwellen gekommen als ich emanuele etwas ausweichen musste ich habe mich gedreht weiter ist aber nichts passiert f nf sechs kurven weiter bin ich dann vom bremspedal abgerutscht wieder auf einer bodenwelle der einschlag war heftig es war ganz klar mein fehler es tut mir leid f r das team und hoffe dass so etwas nie wieder vorkommt
9312250 gratulation an emanuele und marcel mit platz drei haben sie ein gutes ergebnis f r audi geholt unser wochenende war das nicht wir hatten alles an pech auf unserer seite wir wussten dass es hier schwierig f r uns wird aber dass wir so viele probleme hatten ist schade schade ist auch dass wir das auto nicht reparieren durften wir wissen ja wie gut audi in solchen situationen ist
9312251 das war ein hartes wochenende wir hatten nicht gen gend zeit um die autos perfekt abzustimmen trotzdem liefen sie ganz gut nach all dem was wir an diesem wochenende erlebt haben ist platz drei ein ordentliches ergebnis die strecke kam uns berhaupt nicht entgegen

9312280 es inadmisible que espa a lidere las tasas de desempleo en la zona euro y m s despu s del legado econ mico y laboral que dej el gobierno central del partido popular con m s de dos millones y medio de nuevos puestos de trabajo
9312281 dentro del pa s extremadura es junto andaluc a la regi n con mayor tasa de desempleo con un 13 86 y que por tanto extremadura es un referente nacional y europeo de paro se le deber a de caer la cara de verg enza a fern ndez vara y eso que esta ser a la legislatura del empleo
9312282 haberse pulido y haber dilapidado el legado econ mico del gobierno de aznar
9312283 estos datos son el resultado de una p sima gesti n econ mica y laboral son el resultado de no haber atendido los verdaderos problemas de los ciudadanos y de no haber adoptado las medidas econ micas oportunas cuando el pp lo demand
9312284 esto no ha hecho m s que empezar en los meses venideros las familias extreme as y espa olas van a pasarlo a n peor ya que la crisis econ mica se agravar
9312285 la crisis se est llevando por delante miles de puestos de trabajo espa a lidera ya el desempleo a nivel europeo y extremadura encabeza el paro en el pa s esto evidencia que la crisis nos est afectando m s que a nadie y no menos como aseguraba el psoe

9312355 zapatero tampoco formula autocr tica sobre el creciente desaf o nacionalista y las tensiones territoriales que se han agudizado en los ltimos a os
9312356 elude tambi n cualquier amago de autocr tica cuando responde sobre la negociaci n con eta
9312357 su conformismo es peligroso porque los nacionalismos suponen una amenaza real para la espa a que dise a la constituci n
9312358 zapatero muestra un desmedido optimismo cuando considera que vivimos una etapa de asentamiento de nuestro sistema democr tico lo cual parece un sarcasmo en unos momentos en los que las diferencias pol ticas y los intereses territoriales han creado graves incertidumbres sobre el futuro de espa a
9312359 la crisis su intensidad no s lo ha tomado por sorpresa al gobierno espa ol ning n pa s estaba preparado para algo as lo singular del nuestro es que las primeras medidas adoptadas para hacer frente fueron aqu en parte por razones electoralistas poco adecuadas para atacar la principal causa del deterioro la p rdida de competitividad derivada de un modelo de crecimiento sustentado en la construcci n y otras actividades con poco valor a adido
9312360 abordar ahora lo que no se hizo antes inversi n prioritaria en formaci n y tecnolog a reforma del mercado laboral y liberalizaci n de los servicios
9312361 la crisis condiciona la soluci n de los problemas pol ticos pero tambi n que los problemas pol ticos enquistados dificultan la superaci n de la crisis
9312362 el president montilla ha contestado que no va a aceptar ni un mal acuerdo ni imposiciones de nadie
9312363 lamentablemente la econom a espa ola contin a acumulando datos muy preocupantes y ya no tanto por la incidencia directa que tienen en el presente sino sobre todo por el panorama plagado de incertidumbres que sigue abri ndose camino a medio plazo a n se desconoce cu l es el fondo real de la crisis y datos como los ofrecidos en estos d as por eurostat vuelven a situarnos ante la perspectiva de un inquietante futuro
9312364 espa a sigue siendo el pa s de la ue donde con mayor velocidad los ciudadanos sufren las graves consecuencias de la desaceleraci n es otra constataci n en definitiva de la irrelevancia de los planes de choque puestos en marcha por el gobierno meses atr s y por ende de su falta de previsi n e indolencia ante la crisis
9312365 es cierto que la crisis que padecemos es de car cter mundial pero aqu y ahora se ha reforzado por acci n y omisi n
9312366 la marca y la imagen han funcionado han servido al presidente del gobierno para renovar el triunfo en las elecciones y para generar en el pp una impotente animadversi n que le ha hecho perderlas
9312367 el boom inmobiliario iniciado en los a os 80 y llevado a su apoteosis en el ltimo lustro ha sido claramente positivo para el desarrollo del pa s ha empujado con fuerza la inversi n extranjera y el turismo ha creado millones de puestos de trabajo y ha aumentado la riqueza patrimonial de los espa oles pero tambi n ha tenido efectos indeseables sobre la conservaci n del litoral en no pocas ocasiones los abusos han estrangulado para varias generaciones la posibilidad de un desarrollo sostenible y han rebajado la calidad tur stica la ambici n desmedida y la miop a de las administraciones cuando no su complicidad han mutilado gravemente muchos kil metros de playa es imprescindible reparar el da o desde luego pero sin cometer nuevas tropel as y arbitrariedades contra el ciudadano
9312368 el nuevo escenario pol tico deja descolocado a otegi cuya invocaci n al di logo fue inmediatamente respondida ayer por jos blanco que subray que esa etapa ya se ha cerrado y que lo nico que puede hacer el ex dirigente es intentar persuadir a eta de que abandone las armas lo m s probable es que otegi tenga que volver a la c rcel en los pr ximos meses pero ser a probablemente un error dar por terminada su carrera pol tica ya que sigue siendo el l der de mayor peso en la izquierda abertzale tal vez alg n d a si las circunstancias cambian y eta da su brazo a torcer otegi podr a dejar de ser un mu eco roto y resurgir cual ave f nix
9312369 el encarcelamiento de otegi y su posterior excarcelaci n representan el fracaso de toda una pol tica de apaciguamiento enga o y negociaci n con eta es dif cil para una sociedad democr tica aceptar que este sujeto fuera ensalzado por el propio presidente del gobierno
9312370 fue para el psoe y para rodr guez zapatero el caballero blanco de la negociaci n con los terroristas no es extra o que arnaldo otegi abandonara la prisi n reivindicando el di logo y la negociaci n que ayer mismo rechaz tajantemente el vicesecretario general del psoe jos blanco
9312371 arnaldo otegi es una especie de etarra en comisi n de servicio al que los tribunales rechazaron su complemento de destino envi ndolo a una penitenciar a

9312381 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this

9312441 you know you play a character people perceive you as the character i guess it means i did my job but what did i do i went out i was 18 years old at 18 youre going to sorority parties i just did it in the public eye
9312442 i certainly wasnt showing my crotch just because i was on 90210 didnt mean that i didnt get to have my own real life experiences you have to live somewhat normally
9312443 employers have had to put a hold on recruitment as the credit crunch bites it is understandable that businesses want to be in good shape coming out of this economic uncertainty and so redundancy just cannot be ruled out

9312445 inflation in kuwait is imported since the country imports most of its commodities from abroad
9312446 the only domestic factor affecting inflation is the rate of exchange of the dinar which is under control

9312448 maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 125 miles 205 kilometers per hour with higher gusts
9312449 gustav is a category three hurricane on the saffir simpson scale
9312450 we had a very good period of economic management and economic success which has for sure provided us with really serious platform to weather these storms
9312451 the question for the country is who is better to take us through this turbulent period
9312452 is it an experienced pilot and co pilot in gordon brown and alistair darling who have had the experience or is it two people in david cameron and george osborne who have had no experience of flying a large plane whatsoever
9312453 we talk to each other all the time each of us talks for the other im sorry about this but were not clones of each other and we sometimes use different adverbs and adjectives
9312454 the message from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same weve had a very good period of economic management and economic success which has for sure provided us with a really serious platform to weather these storms
9312455 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of roman pavlyuchenko to the club
9312456 the great deluge not only affected their livelihood and communities but also their traditional songs and culture rather then focusing on the destruction we have concentrated on the resilience and survival instinct of man
9312457 commercial music takes a lions share of the music industry but there is still a market for our music
9312458 the album happened accidentally actually i was composing songs along with my band for an untitled album a passing thought about mankind and the supernatural power gave me an idea to compose something in the name of god so we all screamed bismillah
9312459 as per our tradition whatever we do we should always begin by taking gods name the album just emphasises that
9312460 the album is being launched on the eve of the holy month of ramzan perhaps this might act as an antidote for the pain people are suffering due to flood earthquakes and bomb blasts my eyes moisten whenever i remember that god has been protecting us humans at all times
9312461 playback singing was something i never dreamt of coming so easily i am happy that people like my voice and composers are ready to sign me for their projects
9312462 on the playback front lots of things are happening i am also singing the title tracks of de taali and chandni chowk to china there are also lots of other projects like golmaal returns rama the saviour kambakht ishq and mere khwabon mein jo aaye

9312468 en europe linflation est purement li e au p trole et lalimentation
9312469 pense que le pic dinflation a t atteint en juillet
9312470 sest stabilis e en france 2 et suit le m me sch ma pour reste des pays europ ens
9312471 on a une inflation forte mais pas de tensions sur le march du travail ou lappareil de production donc pas de spirale inflationniste on peut donc sattendre retomber 3 dici la fin de lann e et 2 dici un an ou 18 mois
9312472 la stagflation on en a eu une dans les ann es 70 quand linflation d passait 10
9312473 les salaires r agissent de mani re mod r e avec une perte de pouvoir achat pour les m nages comme en t moignent les chiffres catastrophiques sur la consommation
9312474 le choc p trolier daujourdhui est incomparablement plus violent que celui des ann es 70 mais le choc inflationniste incomparablement plus faible
9312475 ont une politique mon taire bien moins restrictive quen europe
9312476 le probl me du japon depuis longtemps c tait la d flation donc un peu dinflation cest pas dramatique
9312477 on peut avoir choc inflationniste plus important car les salaires r agissent

9312494 maternal age influences the chances of conceiving a baby with down syndrome at maternal age 20 to 24 the probability is one in 1562 at age 35 to 39 the probability is one in 214 and above age 45 the probability is one in 19 14 although the probability increases with maternal age 80 of children with down syndrome are born to women under the age of 35 15 reflecting the overall fertility of that age group recent data also suggest that paternal age especially beyond 42 16 also increases the risk of down syndrome manifesting in pregnancies in older mothers
9312495 although the probability increases with maternal age 80 of children with down syndrome are born to women under the age of 35
9312496 80 of children with down syndrome are born to women under the age of 35
9312497 seven months along even her staff was unaware that the first family was expecting a fifth child
9312498 that the pregnancy is so advanced astonished all who heard the news the governor a runner whos always been trim simply doesnt look pregnant
9312499 would a 44 year old woman with four kids out of diapers embarking on her first governorship really get pregnant
9312500 were going with the rumor sarah palin is not trigs mother
9312501 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9312502 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9312503 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9312504 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief
9312505 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9312506 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving
9312507 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9312508 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9312509 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too

9312512 were not looking to call an evacuation and havent issued a state of emergency
9312513 its not going to come this way and were on the dry side anyway we may experience tropical force winds by tuesday
9312514 but as it moves into a less favorable environment in the north central gulf of mexico where the water temperatures are cooler it could encounter wind shear
9312515 we could get some rain bands out of it and theres the possibility of tropical force winds depending on where it is
9312516 we got everybodys telephone number and would call with instructions
9312517 we have 600 in texas city and about 1 100 or 1 200 on the mainland and several thousand in galveston
9312518 during rita we sent out everybody on school buses with no restrooms
9312519 it wasnt that comfortable and they traveled a long distance but it worked and would have saved lives
9312520 we will use it primarily for catastrophic storms as a way to safely evacuate in phases to get the galveston county population ahead of the regional population
9312521 at least we know weve got something and thats better than nothing when it comes to an orderly evacuation of the region
9312522 if some decide they cant live without air conditioning and theyre not in the danger zone and dont want to take a chance we have no control over that
9312523 people were more nervous than they had ever been for a hurricane when they saw the same storm on the same track over the course of five days anxiety levels were very high
9312524 as well as building reliability into our products we provide a generous warranty
9312525 now that theyve emptied the garage im worried theyll move on to the house
9312526 we know theres people watching waiting for something to be left out
9312527 as long as there are a large number of people addicted to narcotics that live on this island well always have a problem with theft
9312528 you would expect that youd be able to put a potted plant on your porch but thats not the case
9312529 some people stealing is part of their culture and part of their life
9312530 to them its a 24 hour a day job if they want it bad enough theyre going to get it you have to remain vigilant against that
9312531 hopefully news coverage will be heavy and tell people when the roads are clear or when grocery stores are open
9312532 who knows the university of texas medical branch or mainland medical center might not be fully operational you have to gauge what there is to come back to like a worst case scenario but i certainly hope we dont see that
9312533 theres not much good in coming back in town if there is no electricity or no grocery stores to provide food after the storm makes landfall well determine how quickly to allow people back in

9312602 we are investigating whether he is operating a business out of a residential property a location not zoned for commercial retail sales
9312603 what it comes down to in this particular case is is it artwork or commercial sales if he wants them to be art as weve currently classified them they cannot be offered for sale
9312604 well art is art and how many pieces of art arent sold everyday
9312605 i dont know if they were ever that excessive but the perception is there

9312607 for young kids and teenagers it seems like most parents are getting them unlimited texting it seems like they dont even talk to each other they just text
9312608 once you get to people about age 50 to 55 and up sometimes they actually get mad if you ask about it they think its a waste of time unless youve got a hip grandma or grandpa theyre not going to use it
9312609 texting talking on the phone eating reading newspapers and maps changing clothes weve seen people do it all while driving and its all dangerous
9312610 we will continue with our plans to revitalize downtown stokesdale
9312611 we prefer to present this special facility to the public when there is some grass and landscaping and when it better resembles a park
9312612 the town council took the unusual step of requesting a meeting between staff developer and residents of the neighborhood to attempt to negotiate a settlement of the case
9312613 we dont want this to be just one event rather a series of events that come together
9312614 we know that oak ridge is much more than just the last 10 years but this year gives us a reason to celebrate
9312615 its always been about people and what makes oak ridge special and not just the incorporation
9312616 my personal experience is that people around here are very conservative with water especially when they have to pay for it
9312617 the ones that do id assume would be the older wells under 50 feet deep that depend on runoff
9312618 with that being said id still encourage people not to waste water
9312619 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9312620 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9312621 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9312622 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9312623 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9312624 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9312625 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9312626 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9312627 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9312628 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9312629 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9312630 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9312631 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9312632 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9312633 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9312634 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9312635 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9312636 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9312637 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9312638 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9312639 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9312640 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9312641 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

9312764 we need to recognize that people have a limited time to think about and deal with these things asking people to even spend a little more time on green issues is a big deal
9312765 this funding is not being ring fenced in this financial year but is currently being paid through the area based grant this gives local authorities flexibility about how they used their resources

9312767 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future

9312769 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative

9312771 in a 69 page ruling the justices reviewed and dismissed each of gunner jay lindberg s numerous claims that the two special circumstance findings that put him on san quentins state prisons condemned row were bogus instead the justices concurred with a 1997 orange county jurys determination that lindberg had attempted to rob thien minh ly before killing him and that the crime had been racially motivated

9312779 because national oil companies may be motivated by different objectives than private oil companies their performance characteristics are also likely to be different this might be of little consequence to consuming countries except that in a tight oil market the national oil companies may become an impediment to the smooth functioning of the world oil market in the future
9312780 it is imperative that the brazilian government follow a major global trend and start renationalizing as soon as possible the petr leo brasileiro sa petrobras
9312781 why countries such as russia venezuela ecuador bolivia and others have renationalized their oil and gas industry in the last few years
9312782 it seems that if oil is so important and so rare as they tell us we should have a better control of our own national reserves when we take in consideration that oil is a strategic and economic asset
9312783 it is imperative that the brazilian government renationalize petrobras immediately and use this amazing source of funding to fund the enclosed economic development plan to plant the seeds for brazil to be able to develop the new economy of the future and to help it to blossom and create millions of new jobs for the brazilian population

9312813 its really a worry for us all how easily now young people seem to want to settle disputes and scores by carrying knives
9312814 its a real challenge for i think every community up and down the country how we deal with that and how we point out that if something does happen and youre carrying a knife youre more likely then to use it

9312816 if you can get guys like charles you need someone to back him up
9312817 i would love the job theres no question about that but you have to weigh up your life
9312818 i was thinking i could do it and i would love the job but its a question if i want it or not
9312819 there are a lot of people who could do that job
9312820 you need someone who has the ability to come in sees what needs to be done and get on with it
9312821 he cannot be hampered by people saying this is the way its been done in the past and the way were doing things now youve got to have someone who says no that isnt good enough
9312822 were not getting the right results for the money that is being poured into our sport its as simple as that accountability now has to come into it
9312823 theyre going to have to upset people theyll have to go in there and start carving things up making sure that its best for the athletes rather than the system
9312824 but they need someone that when theyre out on the warm up track just about to go out into the olympic stadium tells them this is what youve got to do
9312825 no messing around youre not going to fall off the back of the pace and just hang around and finish in eighth or ninth weve supported you youre good enough get out there and start winning medals
9312826 i think from what i see he was doing a brilliant job i havent heard the criticism or negative things
9312827 hes more than capable of doing what he needs to do he has a team around him that assists him getting the team where they need to be
9312828 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods

9312833 earlier this year the ontarget r trial showed that telmisartan is as protective as but better tolerated than the ace inhibitor ramipril the transcend r results represent a moderate but important step forward for high risk patients who cannot tolerate an ace inhibitor
9312834 until now physicians treating acei intolerant patients at risk of heart attack or stroke did not have a proven alternative to the ace inhibitor ramipril a situation we faced with one in five high risk patients we now have the scientific evidence to show that telmisartan protects acei intolerant patients against heart attack stroke and cardiovascular death while showing a placebo like tolerability this builds on previous findings of the ontarget r trial and gives physicians the confidence of prescribing a drug with proven efficacy that will be taken as prescribed and not left in the drawer
9312835 while cardiovascular treatment has improved substantially over the last ten years telmisartan still further reduced cardiovascular risk we are proud to have advanced medical knowledge in the cardiovascular arena with our landmark studies ontarget r and the parallel trial transcend r we have followed almost 50 000 telmisartan patients in clinical trials in the last 5 years and now have experience from daily use of telmisartan summing up to 25 million patient years all over the world this makes the medication one of the best researched cardiovascular drugs with an outstanding efficacy and safety tolerability profile

9312863 i put myself on a gluten free diet and it was instant it was right away that i noticed a difference
9312864 when you dont have that anxiety of getting sick its such a freeing experience
9312865 if you can call it a system the system is badly broken
9312866 were spending them right now its just that theyre not being spent in a way thats giving us the outcomes that we should have
9312867 when you look at the cost of health care nationally and the rapid rate of increase of those costs its something that we can no longer ignore
9312868 and thats completely apart and separate from the human aspect of illness and disease and the human toll it takes on families and individuals and communities
9312869 what we want to do about it is change the conversation first of all from talking about health care to just talking about health
9312870 certainly its a good idea to try to bring into public policy the infrastructure that will promote healthy lifestyles
9312871 if you can have more bicycling lanes and walking paths and healthier school lunches things like that that will certainly help promote a better lifestyle
9312872 healthy lifestyle will help to prevent diseases that are related to obesity so its really primary prevention
9312873 its trying to stop disease before it can even potentially exist
9312874 the greatest challenge we face as public health officials is the american culture
9312875 what we can do as a community and as country is to change that environment so that people who live in that community more naturally make a healthy choice
9312876 ultimately what you want to do is take care of your health so that you dont have these health issues come up that you would require medication for
9312877 a lot of people dont realize the emotions and difficult situations we face in our lives get trapped both in our body as well as in our energy field
9312878 its those negative emotions and the stressful situations that lead to disease
9312879 its important to know that while they might have the disease they have not lost their creative sides
9312880 when people are engaged in art whether its creating or viewing theres no need for short term memory
9312881 youre seeing the person come to the surface and the disease fade away
9312882 it doesnt stop the disease but it does have an effect on the person
9312883 i enjoy it it makes me happy and keeps me busy
9312884 they get to work together on these things and really have fun
9312885 i always try to sit in a certain chair so i can look out at the birdbath
9312886 thats just the new normal and people dont like the new normal
9312887 theres just a lot of bad news out there and the workplace is just one of the weak spots
9312888 i think the human psychological underpinning of buying and selling stocks is pretty universal for both the amateur and the professional
9312889 if youre a younger person with a much longer time horizon with much greater risk tolerance markets like this give you an excellent opportunity to put more money to work
9312890 establish what your needs are what your goals are what your plans are and the professionals will sit down and put together a program with an acceptable level of risk tolerance
9312891 you need to be well armed with an array of plans for all situations
9312892 you need to spend time educating yourself so that youre prepared for all different types of markets
9312893 people hold on to losers because they dont want to admit theyre wrong they think things are going to get better
9312894 when you go into a trade you have to have some idea of when you get out of a trade
9312895 at the moment you enter a trade you should set that exit plan up
9312896 if you find yourself rooting for or cheering for your stock as if its a sports team you have to step back

9312943 two of linderts major conclusions are that the spread of democracy has historically played a pivotal role in the rise of social expenditures and that social spending has not gravely weakened economic incentives and long term economic growth despite the drumbeat of criticisms from free market devotees indeed lindert concludes that the net national costs of social transfers and of the taxes that finance them are essentially zero
9312944 peter lindert inquires as to whether social policies that redistribute income impose constraints on economic growth although taxes and transfers have been debated for centuries only recently have we been able to obtain a clear view of the evolution of social spending lindert argues that contrary to the intuition of many economists and the ideology of many politicians social spending has contributed to rather than inhibited economic growth

9312970 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9312971 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9312972 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9312973 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9312974 according to these agreements the russians had certain rights on georgian territory
9312975 now the russians have no rights whatsoever on georgian territory their presence here is illegal and they should leave georgia

9313019 i need a fix cuz im goin down i didnt make it to the ferry at 11 00 the next morning because i was still sleeping the deathlike dreamless sleep of the hopelessly drunk i had briefly wakened at 7 am but thought that it was 7 pm that mistake in judgement cost me dearly because at that time i lost all hope and passed out again so when i got up for real at 11 it was already too late i had missed my chance to leave what had happened it would come back to me slowly well come back to it later i was trapped for at least another day the ferry had started to run on a strange schedule for the holiday weekend and it was completely unpredictable so i figured i would make the best of it snorri made good on his promise to take me swimming in the salt water pool of haimaey we roamed around the town but of course i had seen it all an island is a terrible thing you quickly run out of new things to do when i got frustrated by the camp i could go out walking but you can only walk so far when the ocean surrounds you i climbed to the top of the mountain which was topped by a heavy cloud i wanted to stand in that cloud from the mountain i couldnt see the camp at the bottom the music came through the fog distorted in strange ways when i got to the top there were thousands of puffins milling around in the fog i felt like they were all judging me i told them i was sorry not so much according to plan snorri came back i thought he had forgotten me and i was touched that he would come to my rescue i was in my tent reading the anne rice novel and suddenly i heard his mirthful icelandic voice calling me out brandon from ootah are you sleeping
9313020 thats ok man cuz we are fucked up we are going to have such good times
9313021 yeah im in a film thats being shot there im an actress
9313022 i dont really know it seemed like a good idea at the time

9313029 oh yes well my friend let them go its not good to rape girls if you go to prison in iceland then you did something very bad like selling drugs or raping a girl or selling drugs to a girl while raping her there isnt much crime in iceland but if the police come for you just run away the police here dont have guns just pepper spray one time i woke up with a hangover and i couldnt remember anything i was like what the fuck and so i turned on the tv and i saw my friend vomiting blood and pepper spray and i was like what the fuck the new government wants to make a military in iceland what for i dont know and there are protesters can you believe there are save iceland protesters iceland has the cleanest energy in the world but there are save iceland protesters fighting the pollution

9313032 wat voor een samenleving streeft u na met de ael
9313033 een samenleving waarin ieder individu ongeacht religie of afkomst kan leven met behoud van eigen normen en waarden met de eigen identiteit
9313034 stel dat de kiezers hier ooit en masse op de ael stemmen en u komt aan de macht krijgen we dan een islamitische staat
9313035 dan krijgen we een islamitische democratie sjoeracratie overlegdemocratie red ja met de sharia erbij als de meerderheid dat wil kunnen ook lijfstraffen worden toegepast absoluut voordat je de lijfstraffen gaat toepassen moet je een ideale islamitische staat cre ren waarin alle problemen zoals armoede zijn opgelost dat is dus feitelijk haast onmogelijk
9313036 zeker ze moeten zelf weten of ze homoseksueel willen zijn of niet wel op een voorwaarde dat ze niet gek gaan doen met die gayparades en zo ze moeten zich normaal gedragen en niet in het openbaar hun seksualiteit beleven dat geldt trouwens ook voor de heteros
9313037 stel de ael regeert dan zullen we er als eerste naar streven op allerlei manieren rechtvaardigheid te laten zegevieren en niet zogenaamde rechtvaardigheid dat willen we bereiken via de democratische wetgeving die ons is toegestaan
9313038 wat is sharia sharia is onderdeel van een islamitische levenswijze letterlijk betekent sharia levensweg levenswijze het is een uitgebalanceerd stelsel van regels met zowel rechten als plichten maar sharia in het beeld van een plain hollander is lijfstraffen en dat is alles
9313039 dat is de extreme straf voor diefstal maar die kan bijna nooit uitgevoerd worden omdat aan ontzettend veel voorwaarden voldaan moet worden wanneer je de sharia wilt invoeren het systeem gaat uit van gelijkheid en het ontbreken van armoede dan heeft iemand geen nood om te stelen maar als hij het dan toch doet met voorbedachten rade en het gestolen goed zat achter slot en grendel
9313040 onder die omstandigheden wel en weet u waarom ook in de islamitische staten waar een sharia geldt waar ik het overigens niet mee eens ben omdat daar niet aan alle voorwaarden van de ideale islamitische staat wordt voldaan maar ook in die staten zie je dat criminaliteit en diefstal bijna niet voorkomen hier worden dagelijks banken overvallen in het midden oosten n keer in de drie vier jaar begrijpt u je kunt daar veilig over straat lopen verkrachtingen komen amper voor dus de lijfstraffen kunnen wel degelijk een voorbeeldfunctie hebben
9313041 bent u voorstander van het invoeren van lijfstraffen in nederland
9313042 dat is geen relevante vraag zoals ik al zei ik ben daar alleen voorstander van binnen de ideale islamitische samenleving lijf straffen passen niet in het nederlandse stelsel maar de doodstraf mag van mij best een strafmiddel zijn in een staat als nederland als daardoor minder moorden zijn
9313043 ik heb nooit over homoseksualiteit gesproken binnen de nederlandse context alleen binnen de islamitische context wie echt gelooft wat allah zegt kan geen homo zijn
9313044 ja en op voorwaarde dat ze zich normaal gedragen heb ik geen probleem met ze maar daar hoort de gay parade bijvoorbeeld niet bij daar zeggen homos heel duidelijk wij zijn anders wij zijn niet normaal
9313045 ik zeg ook niet dat het niet mag maar je moet consequent zijn als jij tegen mij zegt ik ben homo en zo wil ik gerespecteerd worden geef mij dan ook geen aanleiding om geen respect voor je te hebben zodra je meedoet aan de gay parade en je seksleven als het ware uitbuit om een bepaalde positie te verwerven dan vind ik dat gewoon belachelijk
9313046 homoseksualiteit is prima als je het maar niet in het openbaar toont
9313047 je moet vragen wat is mijn standpunt in het tonen van seks in het openbaar daar ben ik tegen
9313048 dat is een suf voorbeeld je zou moeten beginnen bij een televisieprogramma als neuken doe je zo je moet afstappen van die overdreven seksuele lust die heerst bij heel veel televisiemakers je wilt generaties opvoeden waarom moet een kind worden opgevoed met playboy en penthouse in huis en n en al bloot kan dat niet anders
9313049 maar wat is het probleem van het tonen van affectie op straat
9313050 ik vind het niet nodig ik heb liever een wat beschaafder straatbeeld wat beschermer
9313051 ik ben nergens bang voor ik wil alleen niet dat mijn zoon of mijn dochter van vier jaar op straat ziet hoe mensen seks bedrijven
9313052 dat is het begin het is een onderdeel van uiteindelijk gemeenschap bedrijven het n leidt tot het ander j ik begrijp dat u het niet met me eens bent maar we moeten juist in debat komen ik gun u uw mening en u moet mij mijn mening gunnen en zolang die niet tegen de wet in gaat heb ik recht op die mening
9313053 uiteraard maar begrijpt u ook dat mensen het gevoel bekruipt dat de standpunten van de ael indruisen tegen de westerse verworvenheden
9313054 onzin dat vind ik zo plat ik lees en hoor altijd dat de islam vrouwen onderdrukt maar in de jaren vijftig werd nog in europa vergaderd of vrouwen mens zijn of dier en de vrouw mocht volgens de britse 1908 nog verkocht worden

9313112 the whole thing continues to be a lesson in misery
9313113 will never testify he will never cooperate with the government he doesnt trust them
9313114 i dont know what impact that might have had she would have no marital privileges then
9313115 as it stands the government is looking at anyone they can who is connected to this case
9313116 a spouse cannot be compelled to testify against a spouse in court although each spouse can waive that right and there is a confidential communications privilege where a conversation between a husband and wife cannot be disclosed in a court of law

9313151 investigation resulted in a 40 year old man charged with two counts of incest and two counts of sexual assault
9313152 i know a lot of girls come around here to wave at the guys and do whatever but i come here for my man and my man only
9313153 i think sometimes maybe i shouldnt come here every day because maybe to see me walking away they cant hold me or hug me it probably bothers them
9313154 they wont let me inside until one year after ive been out of jail
9313155 even though its glass visits prisoners and visitors are separated by a glass partition i guess thats just their rule
9313156 i didnt want to go and see him face to face so i just come out here and wave and say hi and show that im around sometimes they miss you and they just want to see you they are in there so long
9313157 these guys will wave little white things across the windows signals for stuff and sometimes girls will flash boys or show them their bum or something
9313158 in my experience it hasnt been disruptive theres been nothing that would cause us any concern
9313159 if we saw something that caused concern we would contact government security or the police
9313160 sometimes they ask when are you going to be there
9313161 when my boyfriend is in there everybody has contests over who has the better looking girlfriend

9313163 he gave me an opportunity and i figured id better take it
9313164 thanks for taking an interest in me and seeing me as a human being
9313165 to reach out to a homeless person who really needs help that takes extraordinary character
9313166 i couldnt get the drivers door open so i went over to the passenger side
9313167 as i crawled in i saw the red seat belt release button he was still suspended upside down i pressed it and it didnt release to the full extent so i just grabbed the belt with my hands and i pulled down and all of a sudden it released and he came down
9313168 it was pretty hot in there from what i can remember
9313169 i said to myself its either he goes or we both go so i got to get him out because i knew there was fire on the outside
9313170 its scary now but during the time i just wanted to get him out of there
9313171 it brings a tear to me now because when i think of it i could have ended up in there with him because i wasnt coming out without him
9313172 i dont feel like a hero i just acted on impulse
9313173 hes constantly telling vic he fears hes going bald or if he spots a hint of a paunch on his midsection he hits the gym for an hour
9313174 david is so vain he cant stand the thought of growing into a fat bald old man
9313175 shell tell him she found some hair in the shower and ask was that his she loves teasing him about his future as a schlumpy old man because it gives her the upper hand a button to push
9313176 the idea is to allow talented young cricketers the option of completing their high school education
9313177 and the option of adopting cricket as a profession or completing full education and becoming useful citizens
9313178 they face problems adjusting to the glamour fame and money that comes automatically for an international cricketer these days
9313179 the main problem is that our sportsmen dont have facilities to carry on formal education and also play their sport at the same time because of financial constraints
9313180 if we can get only five or six boys good for cricket we would have done our job

9313247 ivabradine was always known to relieve ischemia with the beautiful results ivabradine is the first antianginal treatment shown to reduce myocardial infarction and revascularisation and to have a good tolerability profile even when used with other drugs this is the gold standard for any antianginal anti ischemic drug
9313248 often a lot of investigations are performed in coronary patients but a simple heart rate measurement is not done beautiful has reinforced the need to measure heart rate in all cad patients and if the heart rate is more than 70 bpm to reduce it by using ivabradine on top of background therapy
9313249 half of the cad patients have a resting heart rate more than 70 bpm these patients can now benefit from a treatment that will greatly reduce their chances of having another heart attack or needing further surgery

9313256 a menudo muchas investigaciones sobre los pacientes coronarios se hacen sin medir la frecuencia cardiaca beautiful ha reforzado la necesidad de medir la frecuencia cardiaca en todos los pacientes coronarios y reducirla con ivabradina si la frecuencia cardiaca supera los 70 lpm adem s de la terapia habitual
9313257 la mayor a de los pacientes coronarios tienen una frecuencia cardiaca en reposo superior a 70 lpm estos pacientes pueden ahora beneficiarse de un tratamiento que les permitir reducir el riesgo de padecer otro infarto de miocardio o necesitar cirug a en un futuro

9313281 they always say he was a maverick and this made me think well he really is he went all the way to alaska there arent that many people up there they dont have that many electoral votes and he picked this person i know people will say shes inexperienced but shes been a governor for 20 months thats more experience than obama has
9313282 no one in my office has any idea about her and the only comment im hearing which is not good is that shes a woman and thats why she was picked
9313283 you would feel she has the same values as you having a child with down syndrome and being the governor and she calls herself a hockey mom i was impressed shes very pretty and seems very smart i hope it works out
9313284 i think a lot more could be being done as opposed to just a hard edged enforcement around stop and search
9313285 if were seeing a number of the guys who are committing the murders are already marginalised already excluded and we are trying those kind of tactics on those individuals i fear we just make the problem worse
9313286 use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with russia
9313287 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9313288 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9313289 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9313290 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9313291 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9313292 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9313293 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9313294 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9313295 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9313296 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9313297 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9313298 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9313299 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

9313305 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9313306 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9313307 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9313308 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9313309 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9313310 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9313311 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9313312 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9313313 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9313314 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9313315 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9313316 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9313317 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9313318 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9313319 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9313320 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9313321 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9313322 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9313323 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9313324 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9313325 kinder gehen in ihrer freizeit mit spa und faszination dem bildschirmspiel nach wichtig ist sie f r einen kompetenten umgang mit den medien zu st rken eine kritische auseinandersetzung mit den inhalten der spiele muss stattfinden und m glichkeiten zur mitgestaltung an den inhalten m ssen gegeben werden das deutsche kinderhilfswerk fordert die interessen der kinder auch bei der gestaltung von pc spielen mit einzubeziehen und gemeinsam mit der jungen zielgruppe spiele zu entwickeln gerade die dimension der eigenen mediengestaltung f hrt zu einem kompetenten umgang
9313326 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9313327 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9313328 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9313329 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9313330 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9313331 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9313332 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9313333 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9313334 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9313335 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9313336 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9313337 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9313338 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9313339 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9313340 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9313341 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9313342 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9313343 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9313344 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9313345 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9313346 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9313347 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9313348 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9313349 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9313350 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9313351 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9313352 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9313353 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9313354 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9313355 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans

9313362 we practiced hard for these guys weve been hearing this and hearing that about them how theyre the best team in the acc and it didnt phase us
9313363 i would say our team played well for an opening game
9313364 we got whipped about every way you can get whipped
9313365 obviously we were not the ninth rated team in the country we certainly didnt play with the sense of urgency alabama did
9313366 a lot of guys were excited during the week for this game
9313367 for us to come out and play the way we played we dominated the game and came out with a victory yeah a lot of guys are excited
9313368 the way we came out today the way we started the ways we made plays the second half when they got that long kickoff for a touchdown we could have folded but we came back and finished the game i think that says a lot about our guys
9313369 john parker did a fantastic job of making plays when he needed to
9313370 we wanted to come out and take care of the ball
9313371 i came open a lot tonight get me the ball
9313372 because were a private school people think that if they play sports they cant go anywhere
9313373 now we have nate collins who is starting at nose tackle at virginia and theres kids like silas kevin eric joyner kids like arlington hendrickson and jimmy georges who should be scholarship players here and theres vinny love who is probably going to play in the ivys somewhere
9313374 were winning the battle up front and that is what we have to do

9313380 theres one thing that most internet marketers that have been marketing for a while sometimes forget to understand and that the fact that not everyone has internet marketing experience there are still people new to internet marketing and we sometimes give advanced strategies that they would not understand just yet
9313381 we talked in the off season about everybody putting themselves in a position physically to play the game
9313382 we thought the key to the game was not letting them run the ball and running it on offense we shrunk the game and kept them off the field
9313383 skill guys to skill guys in a matchup they have very good skill guys but the key for us was the offensive line and the defensive front
9313384 this is my fourth time playing here at the georgia dome and every game has been exactly like that
9313385 ive liked every one of them because weve won them all
9313386 i cannot remember us getting physically beaten that badly in the last three years
9313387 we created no momentum we did nothing offensively or defensively to do that
9313388 it is easier to sell an existing client a new product than to find a new client

9313604 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
9313605 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
9313606 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income

9313621 they started in los angeles and flourished there for a reason
9313622 because l a is all about image and hype and being seen being seen doing things that are cool people see a photo of paris eating pinkberry and they want it
9313623 the question is are you going to just be a niche player or will you be a national chain
9313624 they clearly are getting a nice buzz within the population but we often mistake our willingness to try new things as a trend
9313625 were not out there trying to get people to endorse pinkberry
9313626 it has been a natural phenomenon were focused on building the right infrastructure growing in other regions and building a fantastic company
9313627 theres always a window of opportunity they are hot for a couple years and die down everything is cyclical
9313628 es war heute wirklich schwierig in dieser hitze die konzentration aufrecht zu erhalten nach dem fehler merkte ich aber dass ich schneller fahren kann als bradley ich hatte einfach den besseren rhythmus und konnte meine power ausspielen
9313629 mit dieser pace habe ich schon gerechnet gabor war an diesem wochenende einfach schnell ich h tte nicht gerechnet dass er am ende auch noch so schnell sein w rde denn es h tte ebenso gut sein k nnen dass seine reifen abbauen f r das team war es in der heimat ein sehr wichtiges resultat gerade nach ein paar entt uschenden rennen
9313630 ich hatte viel spa als talmacsi am anfang wegzog wollte ich mich anh ngen aber er war einfach zu schnell dann hatte ich einen gro artigen fight mit di meglio ich habe alles gegeben als di meglio rausflog wusste ich dass ich heute punkte aufholen kann
9313631 am ende hatte ich in der situation mit olive gl ck
9313632 es sind noch f nf rennen zu fahren und ich bin sehr zuversichtlich f r den rest der saison
9313633 ich freue mich sehr f r das xm acura team
9313634 durch den fr hen fahrerwechsel haben wir uns eine starke ausgangsposition f r die letzte phase des rennens verschafft franck hat einen guten job gemacht und das team hatte eine gute strategie ausgearbeitet ein sehr schwieriges wochenende ich bin vor dem rennen nur 20 minuten im trockenen gefahren und kannte die strecke nicht wirklich gut sogar gestern abend sa en franck und ich noch ber karten und haben versucht den kurs zu lernen und uns zu verbessern das team hat uns ein gro artiges auto hingestellt und wir haben das beste gegeben
9313635 das ist einfach gro artig nach alldem was das team w hrend der laufenden saison mitgemacht hat bin ich einfach nur gl cklich ber das was wir heute erreicht haben ich freue mich sehr f r jeden im team sie haben es verdient
9313636 die leistung in ungarn war gro artig diesbez glich habe ich meine meinung nicht ge ndert
9313637 wir hatten dort im rennen zwei autos die richtig mitfuhren sie fuhren auf ordentlichen positionen und holten einige punkte
9313638 ich hatte das gef hl dass wirklich das gesamte team gut gearbeitet hat
9313639 das auto funktionierte gut und die fahrer fuhren sehr gut die strategie war gut die arbeit an der box war gut zudem war die zuverl ssigkeit vorhanden das war wirklich eine starke leistung auf die wir stolz sind
9313640 toyota hat w hrend seiner geschichte viele h hen und tiefen erlebt
9313641 in diesem jahr ist dies weniger der fall als in den vergangenen
9313642 wir wussten dass sie extrem gut sein w rden wenn wir auf strecken f r viel abtrieb kommen ungarn war daf r ein beispiel in valencia schienen sie zu beginn probleme gehabt zu haben am freitag schienen beide fahrer ber ihre autos ziemlich ungl cklich gewesen zu sein aber am sonntag haben sie ein gutes ergebnis eingefahren
9313643 wir haben nie jemanden untersch tzt alle gegner m ssen mit respekt behandelt werden
9313644 wir m ssen hart gegen toyota k mpfen ich glaube absolut dass wir toyota schlagen k nnen glaube dass wir ein fundamental besseres auto und team haben als sie aber es wird nicht leicht
9313645 valencia war ihr st rkstes rennen das steht au er frage ich denke dass einige der charakteristiken der strecke dies erkl ren k nnten wie in montr al ben tigt man eine gute traktion so wie dies auf allen kursen der fall ist auf denen man hart bremst
9313646 sie scheinen generell eine gute traktion und beschleunigung zu haben ich denke dass sie im niedrigen drehzahlbereich vom motor ein gutes drehmoment erhalten auf solchen strecken werden sie im besonderen f r uns ein gegner sein aber sie werden berall ein gegner sein sie werden berall schnell sein
9313647 nun da muss ich meine meinung wohl nach jedem rennen wieder revidieren das ist auch das aufregende an dieser saison es ist eine saison in der wir nicht einmal sagen k nnen dass ferrari auf dieser strecke besser sein wird und mclaren auf jener so wie wir dies wom glich vergangenes jahr tun konnten
9313648 es ist wirklich schwierig vor einem rennen vorher zu sagen wer von den beiden an die spitze kommen wird
9313649 selbst im verlauf des wochenendes ist es schwierig dies zu sagen ich denke f r die rennen ist dies eine wirklich gute sache
9313650 da muss ich ja sagen ich hatte wirklich nicht gedacht dass er in der lage sein w rde r ikk nen hinter sich zu halten auch in ungarn h tte er ihm punkte weggeholt wenn ihn nicht sein motor im stich gelassen h tte
9313651 wir haben ein auto das auf allen strecken typen ziemlich gut funktioniert wir k nnen unsere aktuelle position auf allen strecken typen mehr oder weniger halten spa ist eine gute strecke ein fahrer kurs den fernando sehr mag er wird dort wie immer viel druck machen ich denke dass wir dort ein respektables ergebnis erzielen k nnen
9313652 wir sind alle stolz auf die fortschritte die wir in dieser saison erzielt haben ich denke dass wir in unseren jeweiligen positionen mit der ausnahme von mclaren so schnell entwickelt haben wie kein anderer
9313653 es wird ein kampf bis zum ende besonders mit toyota es ist ein balance akt zwischen der weiterentwicklung des diesj hrigen autos und der vorbereitung des autos f r 2009 es kommt noch ein neues gro es paket f r singapur wir geben den kampf also nicht auf wir wissen dass es ein harter kampf werden wird aber wir sind entschlossen den vierten rang zu bekommen

9313658 you know what ive actually had my eyes on it since my rookie year im always thinking about that
9313659 but its not a me thing not a spotlight thing i just figure if i can do something like that the teams going to benefit thats my only goal
9313660 to find a better set of corners in the league than what were playing with
9313661 basically for me i just try to attack the ball i dont try to relax my hands no heres the whole thing once im in the range of catching the ball i attack it

9313861 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9313862 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9313863 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9313864 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9313865 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9313866 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9313867 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9313868 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9313869 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9313870 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9313871 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9313872 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9313873 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9313874 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9313875 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9313876 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9313877 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9313878 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9313879 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9313880 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9313881 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9313882 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9313883 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9313884 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9313885 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9313886 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9313887 ive had people spit on me id be walking by and theyd spit on my shoe or on the ground beside me and id have to kind of hold myself up my friends were very loyal and they used to end up in fights trying to protect me from physical and verbal abuse i was broken broken inside
9313888 theyd be saying oh theres that pair from the eurovision they disgraced the country
9313889 i can think of a few low points but i dont want to go into it right now its something im trying to forget
9313890 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9313891 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9313892 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9313893 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9313894 no one works for someone we all just work together
9313895 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9313896 keep perspective this too shall pass dont follow the darkness
9313897 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9313898 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9313899 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9313900 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9313901 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9313902 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9313903 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9313904 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9313905 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9313906 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9313907 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9313908 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9313909 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9313910 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9313911 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9313912 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9313913 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9313914 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9313915 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9313916 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9313917 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9313918 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9313919 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9313920 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9313921 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9313922 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9313923 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9313924 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9313925 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9313926 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9313927 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9313928 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9313929 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9313930 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9313931 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9313932 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9313933 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9313934 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9313935 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9313936 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9313937 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9313938 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9313939 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9313940 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9313941 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9313942 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9313943 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9313944 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9313945 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9313946 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9313947 los m dicos avisaron a palin de que exist a un elevado riesgo de que su hijo menor trig paxson naciera con s ndrome de down rabiosa oponente del aborto palin decidi tener el ni o
9313948 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9313949 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9313950 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9313951 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9313952 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9313953 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9313954 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9313955 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9313956 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9313957 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9313958 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9313959 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9313960 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9313961 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9313962 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9313963 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9313964 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9313965 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9313966 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9313967 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9313968 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9313969 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9313970 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9313971 well since she cant give her side i will at least what shes telling me she bought some stuff from the gm site she didnt have the money in her bank account so it bounced pp kept trying to put the transaction through she got 175 in overdraft fees she finally paid gm but pp kept trying to put the payment through and kept causing nsf fees in her bank account so she talked to her bank and said pp was charging things she didnt authorize her bank decided on their own to reverse all paypal payments over the past 2 months including the three to me
9313972 so youre saying i signed an affidavit to request charge backs from these people
9313973 oh and if i was scamming to buy at goodmama why would stephanie accept a goodmama diaper from me that i recieved during my fraud activity isnt that kinda shady if i was really committing fraud
9313974 um yes the only way to get a bank to reverse charges is to sign an affidavit swearing that you did not authorize the charges weve been through it scammers suck yes you not only screwed an awesome wahm out of her hard earned money but you committed bank fraud i pray stephanie decides to call your local police department and presses itll be shown as a bank error and nothing would ever happen to me charges the foster system doesnt look kindly on people charged with bank fraud and other felonies
9313975 and its really bullshit of you to talk crap about my foster children theyve been through enough and don t need such influences like yours around here
9313976 its too bad she still acted like an insert bgism when she came to the blog
9313977 just wait until they get their mos then youll see
9313978 get the facts straight again well be recieving adoption subsidy for my little girl thank you very much and we are pretty well off thanks for your concern
9313979 this is the internet wooohooooo the internet ive already got another ds username so im sure youll be selling to me in no time jokes on you

9313981 ktpalmer2004 is someone who makes things right for a bank error that she did not authorize
9313982 when i send out money orders ill be the one laughing and youll be the ones saying sorry
9313983 maybe i should say fuck you all and not pay anyone back i was willing to this morning but this is quite childish here maybe ill act just like you a child

9314009 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9314010 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9314011 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9314012 thats all been taken into account and weve consulted broadly with industry groups and theres broad support for the plan so we think weve got those things covered
9314013 they have all resolved as they did back on thursday to return to work tomorrow commencing at first shift monday morning
9314014 we await to see the formal offer for an eba
9314015 it is true to say we reserved all our rights legally and while no final decisions have been taken we would clearly have acted in what we thought were in the best interests of the mastheads and of the business as the situation evolved
9314016 there were no votes taken for anything because there is no formal offer from the company
9314017 we are awaiting a formal offer from the company in writing that we can put to the members for their consideration
9314018 i am someone who is concerned about the quality and diversity of our media market
9314019 it hasnt been positively identified yet but we believe it may have come from the missing aircraft
9314020 due to the captain being alerted to a vibration in one of the engines
9314021 there was no safety issue at any time and the aircraft continued to frankfurt where it landed without incident
9314022 with what we expect will be a minimum of delay
9314023 there was a problem with engine four and the pilot decided to come into frankfurt to repair the engine
9314024 marc is as we say in the film business an actors director
9314025 all the actors on the set really got on with him as far as olga and marc are concerned its their private lives and i dont want to comment on their personal relationship they are however both single people
9314026 when you work so much and travel so much its hard to keep them
9314027 hes constantly telling vic he fears hes going bald or if he spots a hint of a paunch on his midsection he hits the gym for an hour
9314028 david is so vain he cant stand the thought of growing into a fat bald old man
9314029 shell tell him she found some hair in the shower and ask was that his she loves teasing him about his future as a schlumpy old man because it gives her the upper hand a button to push
9314030 those tablets changed him and he started to treat me like a slave
9314031 he was a gentleman and a good man but then he started taking the tablets
9314032 after taking those tablets he told me it was very important for him to have sex three or four times a day
9314033 the united states russia france and britain have worked hard in this direction
9314034 india has already flagged off its concerns and most of the countries of the nsg are recognizing the validity of these concerns
9314035 rhys and some friends were down in the reception being quite boisterous they had obviously been sinking quiet a few drinks
9314036 he was particularly excited when the postman arrived he went outside and was singing hey mr postman and special delivery and giggling to himself manically
9314037 i dont know what was in there but it made a couple of people laugh and then rhys crouched down and slipped the pants between a couple of sacks of mail all the time laughing away to himself
9314038 when the postie arrived back he looked inside his sack and pulled out a piece of underwear he looked as if he was getting ready to gag
9314039 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9314040 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9314041 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9314042 students need to be vigilant about protecting those items and to not leave them unattended
9314043 although landlords almost certainly have homeowners insurance coverage for the physical dwelling renters need insurance to cover their personal property such as clothing furniture or electronic equipment in the event of loss from a fire theft or other mishap
9314044 unfortunately many students dont consider renters insurance until its too late
9314045 this is certainly another challenging schedule for our team one that will get us prepared for big 12 play and hopefully have us playing some of our best basketball at the end of the season
9314046 there are obviously some tremendous tests on this schedule but with a number of home games our fans will have a chance to come see this team develop and mature throughout the year
9314047 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
9314048 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression

9314053 i could possibly lose my house with borrowing money for my summer taxes and replacing the sidewalk
9314054 itll be done this fall and there will be a period of time when residents can pay it
9314055 i strongly support the sidewalk replacement program i always have
9314056 i would have liked to postpone it a year but were going to forge ahead and make the city look good
9314057 visually it might help to better guide and identify what are the assets in the city and how to get there
9314058 the more that we educate not only our residents but our visitors the more they will value our community
9314059 well look at the entire city for a consistent brand or look with the signage
9314060 its proven that historic and heritage tourism helps to drive the economy increase retail sales and other service type sales
9314061 we wanted to associate health care and health issues with ferncare and we thought this would be a good way to do that
9314062 its just a question of getting the wonderful people whove volunteered together and figure out times
9314063 the variety and type of items we believe its from home invasions and larceny
9314064 most of it will bring a good price as scrap metal

9314086 cest une musique avant tout africaine avec des rythmes africains quil faut ressentir avec le corps et non intellectualiser la musique thiopienne se danse contrairement au jazz totalement intellectualis
9314087 jai particip plusieurs tourn es avec le mondialement connu blues man memphis slim
9314088 mon premier groupe de musique en isra l mont en 1972 tait le groupe des soul messengers messagers de l me ce dernier a sorti en 1979 un album intitul the soul messenger band le groupe tait compos de vingt deux danseurs et musiciens tous des h breux noirs nous interpr tions de la soul music james brown du jazz nous jouions de la musique pour les soldats et dans les h pitaux pour remonter le moral des troupes et des malades

9314096 obviously its a little unfair on the supporters because they have shown a preference to sit up the town end and it seems ludicrous to introduce this change just one game into the season
9314097 were going to miss that support and i think it will have a big impact on the team because when they are attacking that end we wont have anyone there to cheer them on
9314098 i saw my first game from that end and the fans who sit there are just as passionate about their end as the rainham enders its a sad day for this support mr scally you need to be ashamed
9314099 we hope to operate as many police free games as we can this year and we also felt we needed to reduce the cost of stewarding for that part of the ground
9314100 we want to spend money building a team that will be challenging for promotion so we need to save it in other areas
9314101 f r t nk om man hade som krav att alla barn skulle springa lika fort vad skulle d h nda med idrotten tanken r absurd
9314102 the amount is not to be termed as rent which would attract 50 per cent tax but is bccis contribution to mca for cricket development
9314103 contribution for cricket development by a member who felt it could be a violation of tax rules but they were brushed aside

9314109 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9314110 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9314111 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9314112 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9314113 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9314114 i think thats when the campaign for national office began
9314115 someone whos stopped government from wasting taxpayers money on things they dont want or need
9314116 someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies
9314117 someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9314118 someone who has reached across the aisle and asked republicans democrats and independents to serve in government
9314119 it would be hard not to appear conservative with the huge budget approved by the majority
9314120 i thought she showed some guts in doing that and really irritated some folks
9314121 ok youve got valley trash standing here in the middle of nowhere
9314122 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9314123 in the role of governor she should be pursuing a transportation policy that benefits the state of alaska rather than pandering to the southern 48
9314124 there were no signs of trauma or foul play dr
9314125 he was one of the nicest most down to earth guys i have ever met
9314126 the british anwar the egypt 2007 hindi sadat village into statement interview commo
9314127 still sorting out the auction rate mess galvins office addresses conflicts
9314128 were all committed to a free market economy but a free market only works when its truly free and its not rigged
9314129 i should just sing the kravitz song whatever i know it and can rock that shit
9314130 doo doodle loot doot doot doo doo doodle loot doot doot doo
9314131 i was born long ago hey im the chosen im the one
9314132 terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease
9314133 understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution
9314134 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
9314135 a winter wonderland on one side and south pacific on the other
9314136 someone had to love hockey enough to want to build this be stupid enough to actually do it and not care about spending 100 000
9314137 we have a message muslim americans are as american as apple pie
9314138 their muslim american community is still suffering from suspicion in an age of the war on terror
9314139 any aggression against iran will start a world war iii
9314140 teachings of islam and the aspirations of the islamic revolution uphold peace and tranquility throughout the globe and are totally against war and escalation of tension being stirred by the us and zionism the brigadier general said
9314141 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9314142 gustav roared into the oil rich gulf of mexico as a ferocious category 4 hurricane sunday after destroying homes and roads in cuba
9314143 i was in the back of the suite doing something
9314144 it was great to come in the dome and throw out a couple of touchdowns o line blocked just great
9314145 we didnt play our best were going to have to play better
9314146 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9314147 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9314148 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
9314149 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time
9314150 its not going to change its not a family show
9314151 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
9314152 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
9314153 im not going to get involved with anybody or anything that could be construed as assisted suicide
9314154 its a legal constraint on me but i am determined to obey the law for the rest of my career
9314155 i dont feel guilty i just feel regret for the stress its caused my patients and my family
9314156 the subject comes up from time to time and people express their views
9314157 i feel it would be appropriate to have a system allowing people control of the end of their life
9314158 that would have to have significant safeguards so that vulnerable people were not disadvantaged the worry is that a person feels they are a burden to their families and might feel coerced into taking part in assisted suicide
9314159 i know the politicians have a lot of other things to consider but i think this is important
9314160 rob monster stirred the venture capital pot last summer when the entrepreneur turned angel investor launched monster venture partners saying at the time that venture capitalists deserved a
9314161 we are seeing impressive companies being built for under 100 000
9314162 that is great news for angel investors and angel funds
9314163 if they can become patriotic and believe in whats happening in south africa and not look for their honey outside of the borders and offer support rather than stomping on people who gave them hours and hours of joy last year and this year we as a nation will grow much better
9314164 we didnt go out there to show them that they were wrong we went out there to exactly showcase our talents and the belief that we do have in ourselves
9314165 the same people who threw their robes on the ground when jesus rode on a donkey were the same people who crowned him and hit him with sticks and stuff like that and were the same people who said afterwards how we shouldnt have done that hes the son of god
9314166 without naming names i do want to make the point that the 2003 world cup coaching team effectively left no legacy to the english game
9314167 there was no structure no real long term planning no development strategy when the edifice fell over after the 2003 world cup there was nothing behind it
9314168 every time rob opens his mouth he does not do himself any favours
9314169 all national and club coaches have a responsibility for developing future england players and he was a club coach at the time england also had an academy to develop young players and it was not the role of the 2003 international coaching team to coach them
9314170 that academy was only developed in 2001 2 which was a bit late to be providing players for 2003 4
9314171 i dont want to get into a slanging match but rob needs to look in the mirror at times because his comments are disrespectful
9314172 when people feel good about their future theyre more inclined to make large purchases
9314173 people have changed their way of living theyre commuting to alberta as opposed to living there
9314174 the level of consumer confidence is probably higher than its been in years
9314175 there is concern about gas and the price of gas theres no question about that
9314176 a lot of newfoundlanders still like to drive a truck whether its to go to the cabin on the weekend or to pull a trailer or to pull their ski doo or their atv
9314177 we hear a lot of media from the u s about the poor health of the truck market but in our experience we havent seen that
9314178 everybody who speaks to me says your poor truck sales on the contrary my truck sales are great in fact ive run out and i need more
9314179 its going to help teachers have more time to do other things
9314180 the needs are great and diverse and as a result we need more specialist teachers
9314181 in their eyes the process is effective but were asking for an independent appeals process to deal with issues that come up
9314182 i think with some collaborative work wed be able to come up with a cap for our high schools
9314183 there havent been any extra supports put in for the high school students and thats one area of concern that weve identified with the department of education
9314184 theres an opportunity for schools to make their case if the need is there
9314185 parents need to be aware that a needs based profile is out there because it could mean more teachers for the schools that their children attend
9314186 teachers in this province have had eight years of zero per cent increases in the last 16 years you can see what thats done if take into account the cost of living and the various strains and stresses on all of us
9314187 we expect a very significant increase in salary and allowances
9314188 faktornya karena indeks harga produsen yang meningkat tinggi peningkatan kesejahteraan buruh migran dan subsidi ke petani
9314189 la prioridad colectiva es la seguridad y por tanto para alcanzarla hay que asumir riesgos y pagar costos sean stos diplom ticos o econ micos
9314190 al no existir prohibici n expresa o una regulaci n internacional para este tipo de operaciones m s all de los principios consignados en la carta de las naciones unidas y otros tratados internacionales el consejo de seguridad no discute estas cuestiones
9314191 la legitimidad de estas operaciones residir en cada caso en las justificaciones o motivos que cada parte involucrada argumente a la hora de defenderlas o condenarlas en cualquier caso ser a absurdo pensar siquiera en el establecimiento de una instituci n o foro internacional con estos fines la esencia de una operaci n encubierta es precisamente sa su confidencialidad absoluta
9314192 el socialismo como f rmula de redistribuci n de bienes materiales no me interesa
9314193 somos idiotas si creemos por ejemplo que la econom a y que me perdonen las decenas de miles de economistas que hay en el pa s es una ciencia exacta y eterna y que existi desde la poca de ad n y eva se pierde todo el sentido dial ctico cuando alguien cree que esa misma econom a de hoy es igual a la de hace 50 a os o hace 100 a os o hace 150 a os o es igual a la poca de lenin o a la poca de carlos marx a mil leguas de mi pensamiento el revisionismo rindo verdadero culto a marx a engels y a lenin
9314194 uno de nuestros mayores errores al principio y muchas veces a lo largo de la revoluci n fue creer que alguien sab a c mo se constru a el socialismo
9314195 trade openness is believed to have been central to the remarkable growth of developed countries since the mid 20th century and an important factor behind the poverty alleviation experienced in most of the developing world since the early 1990s
9314196 seven years ago we introduced at doha what was to be a
9314197 president kennedy who introduced the tokyo round famously said this will lift all boats and help developing countries like japan case made i would have thought
9314198 africa critically needs to realise development and get itself out of poverty through the establishment of fair trade rather than aid
9314199 the aggressive push by the rich countries led by the us and the eu for more trade liberalisation at a time of global crises of food and fuel became too blatant for developing countries to stomach
9314200 i can confirm that we went to south africa for separate bilateral discussions with the facilitator
9314201 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9314202 we remain cautiously optimistic that the dialogue is going to be successfully concluded
9314203 this is why we feel as mdc we have to be committed to the success of the dialogue
9314204 zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9314205 i desperately hope that they in fact i expect that they will change they will become as grown up as some of the larger companies around so in some respects its a predictable thing
9314206 shortly thereafter microsoft and pancerzewski settled out of court terms of the agreement were sealed but one source who claims familiarity with the case says that microsoft paid pancerzewski 4 million
9314207 did you know that there are more than 34 750 registered lobbyists in washington d c for just 435 representatives and 100 senators thats 64 lobbyists for each congressperson
9314208 i think there are some folks that are very active online trying to complain about this particular issue ms novell and theyre welcome to that viewpoint i would suggest that maybe if you are deeply committed to open source perhaps your time would be better spent in doing something positive
9314209 weve got great snow everywhere at the remarks and were delighted to be able to offer a service to help our customers enjoy it
9314210 our new 4x4 buses will transport skiers and riders to our doorstep quickly and comfortably ready for a great day in the snow
9314211 fis is paying increasing attention to the quality of organization both on the field of play and beyond we are proud to partner with zaugg that is well known for its technical expertise and experience in building and shaping snowboard half pipe competition venues
9314212 the zaugg partnership will enable our organizers to use the latest technology in snow clearing and blowing to prepare the best possible competition conditions for the riders
9314213 it has been a hard week because i knew i probably wouldnt have a new player in the team
9314214 we are still playing phil jagielka in midfield and we are still playing jack rodwell in midfield
9314215 we have put james vaughan in when really we wouldnt want him to play for another three or four weeks
9314216 i think it is our senior players who are letting us down at this present time either by not contributing or not defending as well as they should do
9314217 you dont want to go into an international break after a defeat like that but thats the way it is we may change the defence but we cant at the moment because we dont have the players
9314218 we created and we havent done that in other games
9314219 the defending was very very average and it should have been much better
9314220 leighton baines delivered some good balls and we got lots of crosses in but we didnt have the magic player who could have done something different
9314221 i thought we deserved to get a goal out of the game and we kept trying to do the right things
9314222 they changed their system and they always had the threat of peter crouch and jermain defoe on the counter attack
9314223 i didnt think we deserved to win at west brom and we didnt deserve to beat blackburn
9314224 in truth i think we played better against portsmouth than the other games but we didnt get the goals
9314225 science is interesting and if you dont agree you can fuck off
9314226 if a man is proud of his wealth he should not be praised until it is known how he employs it
9314227 at skype our aim is to offer products that delight people and enable the worlds conversations part of our vision means coming up with new ways for our community of more than 338 million registered users to stay in touch skypecasts is one of the many features that weve developed to enable these conversations what weve learned by watching how the product is used and through user feedback is that skypecasts is not quite measuring up to our high standards and expectations for connecting and delighting our users as a result we have made the decision to retire skypecasts from active service for the immediate future effective 12 noon bst on monday 1st september 2008
9314228 honey jakes alive nothing else matters we all got back safe
9314229 only a piece of furniture we bought as a wedding gift to each other
9314230 only twenty years worth of poking around garage sales and thrift stores together dont tell me what its only okay
9314231 i can fix the cabinet that splintered door will need to be replaced but the other one just needs new hinges i can put in new glass
9314232 hey who ordered green peppers mom youve gotta quit ruining good pizza with veggies
9314233 wed better save a few pieces for the other kids
9314234 karens spending the night at out her new drivers license
9314235 we could tell them there was a burglar but then theyd want to help the police solve the case and theyd never stop asking questions
9314236 jon and anne would break out the detective kit you gave them for christmas
9314237 if we finish cleaning everything i dont think theyll pay much attention the cabinet is the only obvious damage if they ask well just say it got bumped and fell
9314238 it depends on why they came if they plan to stay in our world we need to find them stop them but my guess is that cameron wants to return to lyric with something from our world that he can use there that means theyll be back to go through the portal
9314239 ill get extra locks tomorrow maybe look into an alarm system
9314240 can you remember more about your conversations with cameron what did he ask you about what did he seem interested in
9314241 its okay honey we dont have to talk about it right now
9314242 it reminded me of summer camp and i was so tired of running and hiding in caves i finally felt safe tara fussed over me and i taught dustin and aubrey how to play soccer it felt like home
9314243 i went to see morsal plains with tara brutal the grain was all black and it smelled weird tara told me about the attack how hazor poisoned it on purpose and how susan the restorer led the army to protect braide wood
9314244 i know i lived it and its hard for me to believe
9314245 anyway i hiked back to taras house and some guys came to take me to cameron he made a big fuss over me said it was his job to welcome guests to the clans said id run into bad company but hed make it up to me he gave me something to drink and there was this lady she was amazing
9314246 i sat taller and angled away from my parents my jaw tightening
9314247 she helped me realize that no one else had ever really understood me i wanted to become a guardian i had an important job to do
9314248 the woman you met was a rhusican they poison minds dont trust everything youre feeling right now
9314249 jake they used you to find the portal she doesnt really understand you
9314250 how could i forget you made us learn the whole thing one summer o lord you have searched me and you know me blah blah blah
9314251 you know when i sit and when i rise you perceive my thoughts from afar
9314252 sounds like theres someone who understands you a lot better than cameron and medea remember that
9314253 ill get us signed up for some practice space at the fencing club
9314254 if we hide the portal stones cameron and medea wont be able to go back
9314255 we dont want them running around our world they dont belong here
9314256 i know we have to send them back but on our terms without anything that would hurt the people of the verses and what about jake
9314257 we need to keep the portal available in case hes needed there but how will we know
9314258 indeed throwing all of our love support and prayers behind karissa
9314259 its a scientific fact for every year a person lives in hollywood they lose two points of their iq
9314260 is this really a gig charley or are we escaping again
9314261 oh weve got plenty of time charley five hundred and fifty miles and we have to go through memphis
9314262 and do you expect me an unlicensed sixteen year old to drive
9314263 then i think i deserve a trip through the jungle room
9314264 65 to route 40 west lets hit it and well have time to stop for breakfast
9314265 ive rethought the cheese moratorium baby i know youre not going to like this but three months of cheese is enough i cant imagine what your arteries look like i think its time to stop
9314266 because summers over baby and weve got to get back to a better way of life
9314267 please marshalls small jeremy and company will make a big splash no matter where they set up besides growing up around this i have a nose for it
9314268 oh i will hes one of the groundskeepers now you know
9314269 shed wear my cousins old poodle skirt and listen to love me tender over and over again while writing in her diary
9314270 she was different from me scotty i tried to change the world through protest your mother wanted to build something completely different and much better
9314271 all my generation could do i guess was tear apart its going to take our children to put the pieces back together babette was a very careful person very purposeful
9314272 i could try to describe how much she loved you baby but i dont think i could begin to do her devotion to you justice i was so proud of her for how much she loved and gave away she was amazing
9314273 i have come to do the bidding of one much greater than i and who you have found favor with
9314274 ryann thou have found favor with the one who sent me you will be given much and much will be required of you
9314275 the one who knows you better than you know yourself
9314276 thou must search out and put on the full armor of god so that you can take a stand against the devils schemes for your struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the powers of this dark world and against the forces of evil in the heavenly realms
9314277 what could i possibly have to do with all of this youve got to be making a mistake
9314278 there are no mistakes with god thou have heard of david
9314279 he was also a boy chosen by god to accomplish great things god chooses to show his power by using the powerless
9314280 i am gabriel and have come to give you insight and understanding
9314281 but is there any way you can ask someone else
9314282 only you have been given this trial ryann yet you shall not be alone
9314283 as the young shepherd boy david spoke the angel of the lord encamps around those who fear him and he delivers them
9314284 what do i do with these how do i use them
9314285 the spirit will lead you and the ring will open the way
9314286 wait wait dont leave i dont know enough where do i go now
9314287 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that you may be thoroughly equipped for all good works
9314288 i have been here before with great success and have reason to believe you will serve me well
9314289 the one who seeks to bind me must be stopped
9314290 i will be your eyes and ears a guide to lead you in the right direction and
9314291 you move when i tell you to move now kneel before me child of the earth while i make you ready for your task
9314292 my first gift to you is a cloak of darkness it will provide you with cover at night you and the night shall become one
9314293 my second gift to you is a ring of suggestion with it you will have the ability to project persuasive thoughts to those who are weak willed or in the midst of indecision
9314294 lastly i provide you with a bow and arrows of fire these arrows were formed in the lake of fire and will deliver physical and mental anguish to those they touch
9314295 i am one of the stars that fell from heaven my master is shandago and i am his chief messenger you may call me lord ekron
9314296 thank you lord ekron for these gifts i may be young but ill do as you ask to the best of my ability
9314297 it is expected also these items i have given to you are not for use in this world when the time is right you will find a passage into another land there you will put these gifts to work
9314298 like i want to tag along with the newlyweds thanks but no thanks
9314299 yeah thats a good one gretch ill bet youre vegging out in front of hgtv with a carton of chocolate fudge brownie
9314300 itll be fun you can bring riley along hed probably like to stretch his legs
9314301 like he wouldnt want to go out and get some fresh air and sunshine
9314302 you mean that little shuffle you do over to the itty bitty park across the street from your apartment complex whats that take like seven and a half minutes for the whole round trip thats not enough exercise for a growing dog like riley
9314303 so theres nothing i can do or say to change your mind
9314304 but i cant expect the guests to provide everything for our home i figured i might as well get started myself look at this great set of espresso cups that i got at crate amp barrel last weekend for thirty percent off
9314305 and we need a real yard for you to run and play in
9314306 you remember dont you it was just five years ago
9314307 i remember the wizards coming and the pretty tents in the meadow
9314308 they were shouting because no one was listening twenty one wizards came for the castle raising each had their own idea about what we needed so they each constructed their fragment of the castle structure according to their whims
9314309 i dont think its funny the chunks of castle were erected juxtaposed with the others but not as a whole unit i thank wulder that at least my parents had some sense my mother and father connected the tads bits and smidgens together with steps and short halls when nothing else would work they formed gateways from one portion to another
9314310 as long as i have known you youve appeared to be the same age are you ever going to grow up
9314311 im growing up as fast as i can but i dont think im the one in charge if i were in charge i would be big enough to have my own dragon instead of searching for yours
9314312 gally and mince have been missing for a day and a half we must find them taylaminkadot said she heard an odd noise when she came down to the storeroom
9314313 gally and mince may be down here and they may be in trouble
9314314 you have hundreds of minor dragons in the castle and more big dragons in the fields
9314315 im a dragon keeper i know when any of my dragons have missed a meal or two
9314316 i think we should take a dozen guards with us
9314317 i dont think theres anything scary down here toopka after all as you reminded me this is our castle and we certainly havent invited anything nasty to live with us
9314318 it would be better if they were bigger and carried swords
9314319 with your love of learning im surprised youre not in the library with librettowit
9314320 im sorry you got thrown out but you must not bring your snacks into librettowits reading rooms a tumanhofer usually likes a morsel of food to tide him over but not when the treat threatens to smudge the pages of his precious books
9314321 its all right crain hell forgive you and let you come back into his bookish sanctum and hell delight in helping you find all sorts of wonderful facts
9314322 oh no anna couldnt you have dawdled a bit you know how he gets with caffeine overload
9314323 and you know how he gets when i dawdle youve got maybe three minutes before he asks me to get cup number four
9314324 circle eat rest repeat with the occasional head bang into a window to keep us lawyers on our toes
9314325 thanks anna its been good knowing you i wonder if you might coax this little guy back to life
9314326 tandy how many times do i have to tell you youre a danger to plants
9314327 you taking them in isnt an act of kindness you leave the greenery to us old chicks
9314328 i just took in cup four i doubt hes taken a sip yet though hes slowing down
9314329 youre welcome honey take care of yourself and you call me if you need anything hear
9314330 and he says hes ready to sue this firm for inadequate representation unless i do something about it
9314331 ive assured harry that there must be some misunderstanding since youre one of the most capable attorneys this firm has seen in quite some time so please tandy explain to me how one of our biggest clients someone for whom you serve as lead counsel suddenly finds himself facing jail
9314332 well mr beasley i appreciate your belief in my professional abilities but it seems mr simons has some rather extreme positions regarding personal values that led me to determine he is in fact guilty of the crime for which he has been accused when i asked him directly he admitted as much to me
9314333 yes sir i advised him i could not put him on the stand since i would be suborning perjury but he refused to listen it was either let him lie to the court or remove myself from his case i chose the latter
9314334 stupid junkie probably lost his job because of some drug habit
9314335 bet he chooses to live like that easier than getting a job and working for his money like the rest of us
9314336 oh probably not harry youd be amazed what some of the people living on the streets have been through
9314337 dont be na ve tandy that man could get a job flipping burgers at mcdonalds just as easy as sit out there with a cup in his hand begging me to part with my cold hard cash that i worked very hard to get
9314338 harry how would he get a job i doubt he owns any clothing other than whats on his back what would he wear to a job interview where would he get enough sleep in one sitting to be awake for an entire shift what address would he even put on his job application
9314339 why tandy i didnt know you cared so much about our fair citys homeless degenerates
9314340 id think with such convictions you would have a hard time taking my case
9314341 why is that harry you didnt embezzle from hope house which means you didnt take money from the mouths of homeless people which means my awareness of the plight of the homeless works in your favor
9314342 i certainly hope not because if youre confessing to taking money from a homeless shelter i cant put you on the stand id be suborning perjury
9314343 im in a predicament tandy harry simons brings a lot of money to this firm been with us for years that must count for something yet i find myself struggling with the thought of firing you since i understand the ethical dilemma you faced
9314344 and yet i see no course of action but to terminate your employment with meyers briggs and stratton anything less would cause serious repercussions in our relationship with harry simons
9314345 youve got to call somebody about these hawks anna theyre ruining my concentration
9314346 right right well i dont think we have to be that drastic how about a leave of absence
9314347 yes i think that will mollify our good friend harry
9314348 ill let him know youve taken some time to think through your behavior and will come back to the firm when youve gotten some perspective say two months
9314349 its the least we can do youve been a good employee i just wish this mess hadnt occurred
9314350 good luck tandy well see you back here in two months
9314351 well not me ive got eight weeks of a sudden vacation
9314352 ill tell you all about it when i get there
9314353 youre coming home to stars hill yes when will you be here wait what happened did you get fired did something happen at work
9314354 seriously ill tell you when i get there call kendra and joy breakfast at joys 9 a m
9314355 youve got it sister james get down off that table
9314356 go keep your kids from tearing down the house ive got to get home get all my scrapping stuff packed call the rental company to let some crazy tourist in my place for a couple of weeks and get on the highway
9314357 sheesh sis are you ever going to stop with the songs
9314358 james put your sister down i am not kidding with you mister
9314359 the fault dear brutus is not in your stars but in yourself that you are an underling

9314362 maybe someone will see me in the morning and come up and say hello
9314363 and maybe if we both like the same kind of stuff and he has dark brown hair we could be friends
9314364 i bet theres going to be a big playground and a jungle gym and some really tall bushes that go all the way around everything
9314365 yeah i shouldnt be nervous im going to really like this new school
9314366 after i get to know some of the kids i could ask them if they like video games and if they say yes i could invite them over after school to play my nintendo wii
9314367 and then later that week we could have a sleepover and we could all watch scary movies and try out the new camera i just got and eat pizza until we pass out
9314368 we could make it a secret club that no one ever has to know about
9314369 it seems like every time i meet a kid i really like something bad happens and i suddenly have to change schools
9314370 thats what happened with my friend joshua i still talk to him online sometimes but its not the same
9314371 but i have had enough to know that i cant stand the things real breasts are always better fake breasts are like artificial fruit

9314373 ronon and i had finished sparring and i was just relaxing for a bit
9314374 thank you my mother taught me this dance many years ago
9314375 perhaps you could teach me a dance from earth one you are already familiar with
9314376 the girl puts her hands on the guys shoulders and
9314377 you know we could really use some women in this game
9314378 i mean come on ive answered all your questions comparing guys so how about kate hudson or sandra bullock
9314379 ill use someone of the opposite sex if you have to be so stubborn
9314380 shut up okay jennifer this ones for you ronon or sheppard
9314381 oh come on like you dont know hes gonna pick you anyway
9314382 well teyla is a really um beautiful woman and uh
9314383 i mean you are too and youre really um intelligent and i mean um i mean i couldnt choose youre both totally well hot and uh
9314384 come on its not like were gonna go spread this around atlantis
9314385 no no of course not but if ronon just happens to find out
9314386 well if you want to keep us off of each other answer the question
9314387 just say sheppard and get it over with i know i wouldnt be your choice
9314388 oh geez youre just gonna tell me this is all a joke and then punch me for suggesting that you and i
9314389 ever since we got back from manoa cant explain it
9314390 we have been waiting for you the council has of course remained in their decision to give you the use of the gate as long as we may keep the one on the ground of course
9314391 we understand you need that wouldnt even ask for it
9314392 we need to make it official before we give it to your people
9314393 i dont see any reason there should be it doesnt even seem so much like an addiction to me as just a really sudden love for a random food
9314394 in the meantime you might want to find out what exactly goes into these muffins itd be more help if i got ronon to cooperate for some blood samples too
9314395 you were right or at least partially the villagers make these muffins adding in a substance called kinen
9314396 i found it in the ancient database apparently its addictive properties are like an allergic reaction only those allergic to the substance can get addicted to it
9314397 yes that is what im saying the database says theres a quick treatment for the addiction called lyren
9314398 well yeah but in this case the addiction seems to be the sickness ill need to run a few more tests to see if there are any effects besides the addiction in the mean time you need to stop eating those muffins and we need to get some of this lyren stuff
9314399 so now that ive taken the lyren i cant eat this stuff anymore
9314400 how can you love me when i dont know you
9314401 my name is john sheppard i need you to know that i love you
9314402 i dont know how im supposed to do this elizabeth
9314403 i dont know him dont know you i know them
9314404 john can you start from the beginning please im trying to figure out whats going on
9314405 youre not going to believe any of this elizabeth youre too rational
9314406 well there is a program operated by the usaf through which we make contact with the rest of the galaxy
9314407 everyone knows about the sgc they publicized it four years ago
9314408 atlantis in the pegasus galaxy and you are the leader of the expedition
9314409 well when i was in kindergarten i was all set to be a princess
9314410 and then when i was a few years older i wanted to be a cake decorator
9314411 im not this is why by the time i was old enough to have some sense i decided i wanted to be a diplomat
9314412 so that should you become a princess you would be able to perform your royal duties with a grace befitting your stature
9314413 and he simon wasnt crazy about the idea of having an international relationship i needed something steady something that would allow me to stay put
9314414 no it wasnt neither was he but hindsight and all that
9314415 beckett thinks its time we consider the possibility that she may
9314416 yes yes but i believe it to be even more advanced
9314417 you see unlike the naquada mirror that the sgc has encountered it seems that this particular device has a timing mechanism inherent in the design which will enable the user to
9314418 get into and out of different realities without relying on another portal
9314419 damn it we dont have time to run it through the proper tests
9314420 no we havent been able to get a handle on time travel yet
9314421 but im not from the future im from a parallel plane of existence
9314422 every time we make a choice in life we leave one or more possibilities unexplored for each decision there is an alternate reality that exists concurrent with our own in which that decision was made differently if i come to a fork in the road and turn left in a parallel universe john sheppard went right
9314423 there is a version of me who maced you and ran away
9314424 although im not sure how it would work since ive crossed into your reality through unnatural means i forced my way in so im not entirely certain how variations of my meddling for lack of a better word would have physically manifested in other parallel planes within the metaverse
9314425 so youre from a different universe and you forced your way into mine
9314426 yeah thats the gist of it you think im crazy dont you
9314427 id be lying if i said the thought hadnt crossed my mind
9314428 in a bit until then can you just trust me
9314429 a few years ago we had a little mishap that involved tearing a hole in the fabric of another universe
9314430 because there are so many possible universes out there the odds of tapping into an inhabited one are slim so when we attempted to test a theory involving drawing the energy from a universe and harnessing it so that it was usable we assumed that the odds being in our favor wed hit an empty one
9314431 no we didnt this is why we spent a great deal of time and energy developing a way to look into parallel planes without crossing into them which we have sort of managed to do
9314432 mckay created a way to open a window long enough to detect signs of life
9314433 so you know if there are people inhabiting that plane
9314434 more than that with modified life signs detectors we can determine exactly who inhabits the plane and where they are
9314435 so you can look through a window into another universe and see everyone in it
9314436 we can only identify the people whose brainwave signatures we have in our system which is limited to members of the expedition
9314437 we needed to find a version of elizabeth weir in a universe with close enough proximity to our own so there is no possibility of entropic cascade failure
9314438 its the resulting side effect of having two or more of the same person co existing in an identical reality
9314439 its painful its messy and its best if we dont have to deal with it when the realities are close enough it doesnt occur
9314440 your elizabeth doesnt love you back and you plan on using me as a substitute
9314441 look i dont have time to get into this but shes in trouble elizabeth is in trouble and she is you are the only one who can save her
9314442 the device calls me back automatically when the time is up i need to know now will you help me will you save her
9314443 youre the first ive seen here who could match me
9314444 is that what passes as a compliment where you come from
9314445 yeah i guess when youre running for your life it doesnt matter what kind of pants youre wearing
9314446 i guess i learned that the hard way then again i was on the run in khakis not leather pants
9314447 you managed it two weeks out there do you think you know what its like to really survive
9314448 were about the same height you know i bet a pair of my sweats would fit better
9314449 i heard the gun fire and actually i was looking for you
9314450 but i watched you from above running through those woods on that planet you just might be the challenge im looking for you will be no one but my prey a runner
9314451 you dont know anything about me or what ive been through
9314452 i dont have anything to prove not to you not to weir or not to sheppard im not a soldier or a warrior and im not the great rodney mckay if you cant deal with that you can fuck off
9314453 you are a surprise human i did not expect you to come back here
9314454 when i found you you were gripping it so tightly they had to pry it from your fingers
9314455 im going to the range to practice if you want i can show you how to use this
9314456 this is the captain we have a little problem with our entry sequence so we may experience some slight turbulence and then explode
9314457 im going into 4th grade and i got a nice teacher named ms dubroski in third grade i had a teacher named mrs cavaliere i met a friend named erin and she turned out to e my best friend i had the best classmates
9314458 the manifold wisdom of god might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places
9314459 now i know in part then i shall know fully even as i have been fully known

9314466 most people are not dynamic they dont bring anything to the party
9314467 tito is the nicest most sensitive guy on the planet
9314468 when one door closes another opens but we often look so regretfully upon the closed door that we dont see the one that has opened for us
9314469 helen keller 1880 1968 american blind deaf author lecturer amorist in millions of ounces
9314470 i think it is time for the prime minister to look at himself and decide whether he is still fit to be prime minister
9314471 if he still holds onto office the problems of the country will escalate
9314472 aggressive behavior is my nature it is not indecent behavior
9314473 i did not do anything wrong and have the right to continue my work as prime minister
9314474 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9314475 im not going to go into obviously the details of our negotiations
9314476 we are working together as partners to make certain that we cover the concerns of both parties for sovereignty for the iraqi government
9314477 and so everything that we will do in this agreement will fully respect that sovereignty we will look at how the arrangements will go forward we have a number of agreements around the world this is not unknown to people how to negotiate the status of various forces on the soil of a sovereign ally and so the agreement will be in accordance with those principles
9314478 this issue as you know is also a sensitive issue that deals with sovereignty
9314479 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any sofa or strategic agreement between the united states and any other country in the world
9314480 shes in tears up to three times a day and so tired that brads found her collapsed asleep in the bath twice
9314481 shes been working around the clock breast feeding the babies and trying to get them to sleep but as soon as one of them drops off the other wakes up for another feed
9314482 shes also not eating very much right now and blames that on being too busy the doctor says that she needs more calories to gain strength and ensure that her breast milk is healthy
9314483 i never could stand losing second place didnt interest me i had a fire in my belly
9314484 well i will like to say that we commiserate with the president on the unfortunate condition that he is in and we wish him successful surgery
9314485 but we obviously condemn in unequivocal terms the irresponsible manner in which the presidency managed the situation by denying the people of nigeria information and confusing the people with false stories and reports about the health condition of the president this should not be a political matter it is irresponsible politics to play with the health of the leader of the country so we regard this as unfortunate
9314486 so we hope this will be complied with so that in his absence the vice president will provide full leadership and take full executive responsibility so that the country can move on with the leadership that is constitutionally designated
9314487 we are all human beings and we can fall sick at any given time if the story is true we should even be happy that the whole thing went well and he is recuperating what we need to do is to pray for him and to wish him well nobody has control over health it is something that only god controls
9314488 probably as at then the person who was giving the information was not abreast of the situation he had to go back and re confirm the story but i really dont see any big deal about it because we dont know when the operation took place and we cannot confirm the story even as i speak to you now i really dont know the true position
9314489 the man has not told anybody that he cannot perform his functions that he is supposed to be performing constitutionally and that responsibility is purely in line with the constitution
9314490 the responsibility of saying he does not want to run the affairs of the state is left to him
9314491 the killings of men women and children from their so called
9314492 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers which began about 19 30 hrs on saturday august 30 2008 fighters from the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force jtf responsible for the killings of men women and children from their so called
9314493 the precise locations of the battles are odiama creek in bayelsa opia river in delta and the confluence of bonny and andonni river in rivers state
9314494 this is one more occurrence in a fatal wave of uxo explosions affecting innocent civilians and especially children
9314495 this is just one of the dramatic aspects of continued civil warfare in this country
9314496 most of the problems are in the east and south east of the country but also in other areas affected by the latest rounds of fighting including indeed the capital
9314497 in three separate co ordinated attacks in bayelsa delta and rivers states which began about 19 30 hrs on saturday august 30 2008 fighters from the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force jtf responsible for the killings of men women and children from their so called
9314498 operation hunter hunted involved the use of several fast attack speedboats general purpose machine guns rocket propelled grenades and the deadly soviet made anti tank missiles at close range combat
9314499 the precise locations of the battles are odiama creek in bayelsa opia river in delta and the confluence of bonny and andoni river in rivers state
9314500 journalists should visit the locations mentioned above as soon as possible to witness the wreck of gunboats which were still burning when we left to forestall any denial by the military
9314501 from our count the predominantly ethnic northern jtf lost a total of 29 soldiers in the combined assault we cannot account for those that jumped into the water in panic and drowned we lost six of our gallant fighters
9314502 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers which began at about 19 30 on saturday yesterday fighters from mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force
9314503 one of the biggest successes recorded in the intensifying fight against illicit activities in the niger delta
9314504 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9314505 but this is subject to the fact that an appeal is not filed therefore although judges are not bound to follow it the ruling being from the high court has a persuasive authority
9314506 it would all depend on the injuries sustained there are those that may have sustained physical injuries while others had mental and psychological injuries it will depend on the individual
9314507 people are awarded far greater awards for defamation and character assassination i suppose that compensation for torture should be a minimum of sh10 million
9314508 i will obviously be suing and i can assure you the floodgates have just been opened
9314509 on average i would expect about sh7 million to compensate these people
9314510 the case sets a good precedent and gives credence to what we have argued over time that the government should come out clearly and condemn the detention and compensate the victims
9314511 though the plaintiffs were held for different periods of time all of them suffered the same violation under section 74 of the constitution and i will grant a global award of sh1 5 million to each plaintiff for the said violation the plaintiffs will also be entitled to costs of the originating summons
9314512 it is an expensive affair and unfortunately the victims are people of humble means it is because of the fact that they cannot pay the fees required to prosecute their cases that they have been slow
9314513 cold water would be pumped into the dark walled cells as well as hot air alternated with cold air our hands would be tied behind our backs and we were periodically taken before a team of interrogators completely naked where we would be subjected to thorough beatings that often left us unconscious their aim was to break our spirit it happened to a number of people
9314514 everybody has a secret world inside of them all of the people of the world i mean everybody no matter how dull and boring they are on the outside inside them theyve all got unimaginable magnificent wonderful stupid amazing worlds not just one world hundreds of them thousands maybe
9314515 cities are not people but like people cities have their own personalities in some cases one city has many different personalities there are a dozen londons a crowd of different new yorks a city is a collection of lives and buildings and it has identity and personality cities exist in location and in time there are good cities the ones that welcome you that seem to care about you that seem pleased youre in them there are indifferent cities the ones that honestly dont care if youre there or not cities with their own agendas the ones that ignore people there are cities gone bad and there are places in otherwise healthy cities as rotten and maggoty as windfall apples there are even cities that seem lost some lacking a centre feel like they would be happier being elsewhere somewhere smaller somewhere easier to understand
9314516 ten guys were together over the top but about 20 more came up fabio did a brilliant job taking matt into the first climb and just missed the yellow jersey group
9314517 i think i just spent all my energy on the road race right there
9314518 you were still able to keep high speed through the corners but it was a little tricky the first lap until you got used to it
9314519 the last lap i really felt like i was going well
9314520 going up the hill there was a headwind actually the flattest part of the course was probably the hardest a false flat and a headwind you were flying coming back but it was pretty grueling going out
9314521 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
9314522 we just jumped out and got the two ladies and dogs and put them in the boat and took them safely back to hornsea
9314523 they were climbing up the cliffs but couldnt go any further and the tide was advancing it would have continued like that for another hour at least
9314524 playing daniel cousin against celtic is madness and kris boyd isnt even in the squad rangers fans have the 2 most disliked strikers playing up front today in recent years wonder wholl get booed the loudest
9314525 twice we have lost the first old firm game of the season and still won the league so it not really a marker for the rest of the season you just have to win the game
9314526 daniel played against the celtic back four before and did well picking teams is about balance and we think that charlie will give us good balance on the left
9314527 the argument was that boyd could not play up front on his own but they are playing two and hes still not there so it is a slap in the face for him
9314528 i find it strange that one of the top strikers in the country is not even on the bench
9314529 playing daniel cousin against celtic is madness and kris boyd isnt even in the squad rangers fans have the 2 most disliked strikers playing up front today in recent years wonder wholl get booed the loudest
9314530 twice we have lost the first old firm game of the season and still won the league so it not really a marker for the rest of the season you just have to win the game
9314531 daniel played against the celtic back four before and did well picking teams is about balance and we think that charlie will give us good balance on the left
9314532 the argument was that boyd could not play up front on his own but they are playing two and hes still not there so it is a slap in the face for him
9314533 i find it strange that one of the top strikers in the country is not even on the bench
9314534 my mother said ive been coming here since before i was born if you know what i mean
9314535 and so i was really happy to hear that it was back open again
9314536 except for when the park was closed my friends and i spent every other weekend here eight months out of the year for about eight years
9314537 and it seemed in the beginning like every time we came we ended up in adjoining rooms 80 and 82 but now coincidence has become habit so now we request those rooms
9314538 weve already got people calling and coming in to book rooms
9314539 we were in the area and we heard that hotel conneaut had just opened and so we came over to check it out
9314540 its so quaint and rustic and its so unique how the big glass curved wall extends out to the water
9314541 support the sale of pleasure beach to a public or private party for the purposes of maintaining wildlife and preservation
9314542 a lot of people are up in the air over this i dont want to make a decision and not know where people are
9314543 we will certainly be seeking public input on pleasure beach but with that said we are not yet at the point in the process to call for public hearings or referendums because we do not have any agreed upon proposal to present
9314544 its a priority of my administration to re establish access to pleasure beach and restore the park as a beautiful natural resource in the east end neighborhood for all the residents to enjoy we are looking for creative ways to reach this goal
9314545 i dont see why we would put it out to vote people put us in office to make these decisions to make difficult decisions
9314546 if the vote was no it would open the door for dialogue over what can we do with pleasure beach
9314547 but i want to know what people think about this
9314548 the shuttle is an inherently risky design we currently assess the per mission risk as about one in 75 of having a fatal accident
9314549 if one were to do as some have suggested fly the shuttle for an additional five years say two missions a year the risk would be about one in 12 that we would lose another crew
9314550 the shuttle programme in conjunction with constellation and space station have been asked by the administrator to put together some manifest options to assess extending shuttle flights to 2015
9314551 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of us vehicles travelling to the space station as efficiently as possible
9314552 the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9314553 direct nasa to take no action for at least one year from now that would preclude the extended use of the space shuttle beyond 2010
9314554 raised concerns about the reliability of russia as a partner for the international space station
9314555 our concern is that we do not have a guarantee that such co operative and mutually beneficial activity will continue to be available and the successful utilisation of the iss may thus be jeopardized
9314556 its very hard to get your heart and head together in life in my case theyre not even friendly
9314557 we are extremely disappointed that carol albert has decided to give up on the future of coney island when her current lease isnt even up for a number of months

9314561 but since 1999 new evidence has seriously weakened the case that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming and by 2007 the evidence was pretty conclusive that carbon played only a minor role and was not the main cause of the recent global warming

9314563 for us africa still has a huge amount of promise
9314564 there are still things we want to do with the african setting and i think its safe to say well continue to explore it
9314565 that said we might find something new and compelling about the antarctic setting that wants us to make the next game there but honestly were still at the preliminary stages
9314566 the perth amboy police department lost one of its finest today
9314567 officer raji was well respected among his colleagues as well as the men women and children that he encountered on a daily basis
9314568 every day of his life was devoted to public service so its a terrible irony that he should die this way
9314569 just a star thats how cops refer to people like tim just a star

9314572 saya ingin menegaskan bahawa kerajaan barisan nasional bn yang diberi mandat oleh rakyat pada bulan mac lalu akan terus memelihara kestabilan politik dan meningkatkan kemakmuran negara
9314573 usaha pihak tertentu yang cuba menggugat kestabilan ini dengan merampas kuasa secara tidak sah tanpa mandat majoriti rakyat perlu ditolak saya tidak akan membenarkan gangguan ini diteruskan saya tidak akan membenarkan mandat rakyat dirampas daripada barisan nasional yang telah menang majoriti pilihan raya umum secra sah dan mengikut lunas demokrasi
9314574 rakyat tidak akan dimakmurkan dan negara tidak dapat dibangunkan hanya dengan retorik politik
9314575 budaya berpolitik yang keterlaluan merugikan setiap kita malah menjejaskan kemakmuran negara
9314576 i was right beside him i put my hand on his chest i felt his breathing slow down and his heart beat stop
9314577 the doctor said he was brain dead i was waiting hoping somebody could do something
9314578 weve been together over 10 but weve been married for two years he was a bachelor all his life he was a wonderful man never drank never smoked and he was a vegetarian for almost 60 years

9314583 we will do everything to establish equal relations with the alliance
9314584 the transcend study demonstrates the value of telmisartan in people who are unable to tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
9314585 although the benefit is of moderate size there is an impact on a range of outcomes including the composite of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction and strokes as well as cardiovascular hospitalizations given the large proportion of people who are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor the use of telmisartan would be clinically important
9314586 the remarkable tolerability of telmisartan is emphasized by the fact that fewer individuals stop medication if they were receiving telmisartan compared to placebo
9314587 this is particularly noteworthy as all the individuals enrolled in the study were unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor which is a closely related class of agents
9314588 we are trying to draw up a strong text expressing our determination not to accept violence in georgia
9314589 now sanctions are considered of course yes they are considered as well as many other means
9314590 you can only say so many times that something is unacceptable or inadmissible
9314591 the european union has firmly condemned russias unilateral decision to recognize the independence of these two territories abkhazia and south ossetia
9314592 this decision which presupposes a unilateral change to georgias borders is quite simply unacceptable
9314593 the task of a foreign policy is not to describe what happened
9314594 the task of a foreign policy must be securing points of departure for making existing conflicts manageable
9314595 they would destroy our economy and all of the progress we have achieved over the past 18 years
9314596 of course we cant say anything but if he goes on doing it it is going to be harder and harder to get off

9314604 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9314605 there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact german foreign minister ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself
9314606 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy
9314607 i think that might be a bit of an exaggeration there he had hurricane katrina and right now this is no hurricane katrina
9314608 but we still think it will be a large and powerful hurricane and a significant threat the winds are between 135 miles per hour and 155 miles per hour and its a very significant hurricane
9314609 in the last 24 hours weve seen tremendous success of people leaving the area much earlier than they did three years ago
9314610 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
9314611 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace

9314614 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
9314615 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
9314616 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
9314617 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten

9314620 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
9314621 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
9314622 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

9314627 one of warner musics biggest mistakes last year was an album released by socialite paris hilton it sold just 13 000 copies a disaster made worse by the money spent on the heiress and her entourage she brought 14 people with her to the uk a weeks accommodation at the exclusive metropolitan hotel on londons park lane came to around 160 000
9314628 the mixtape format is increasingly popular as a way of generating hype for hip hop artists hip hop mixtapes are usually sold on the street or through independent record dealers or mail order mainly relying on word of mouth to increase the artists street credibility an unsigned artist might release several mixtapes to generate buzz leading to interest from record labels while a signed artist may release a mixtape to promote a future studio album
9314629 we should not be doing this job alone with cooperation from isps we could make huge strides in tackling internet piracy globally

9314638 basically the first day krahulik showed his portfolio and i complimented it weve been best friends ever since
9314639 we had so much fun making them we thought everyone should see these cool comics that we made so we shopped them around to various web sites back then it was still weird to have your own site it didnt really exist
9314640 you heard of click fraud we invented that we would click and click on them until it was 100
9314641 but when i had lunch with them i realized they had no idea what they were doing
9314642 so we said you know what lets do it ourselves
9314643 penny arcade is really polarizing you either really love it hate it
9314644 it already built a strong community so the expo was all about gathering those people into one physical place
9314645 you see people that dont treat gaming as a pastime but as a lifestyle you interact with people just like you and you walk away from a cultural experience
9314646 if i looked at a strip and was like why does this strip have so many more views i could go crazy
9314647 when you try to interpret that information you can come to a lot of wrong conclusions
9314648 penny arcade adventures on the rain slick precipice of darkness

9314661 this raid is an effort to drive immigrants out of mississippi it is also an attempt to drive a wedge between immigrants african americans white people and unions all those who want political change here
9314662 this is political they want a mass exodus of immigrants out of the state the kind weve seen in arizona and oklahoma the political establishment here is threatened by mississippis changing demographics and what the electorate might look like in 20 years
9314663 they both just make it easier to exploit workers the people who profit from mississippis low wage system want to keep it the way it is
9314664 she first called her brother and then began calling anyone else she could think of
9314665 an agent grabbed her arm and asked her what she was doing so she went into the bathroom and kept calling people until they took her phone away
9314666 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
9314667 its a constant process to keep the union alive and growing
9314668 its hard to believe that a two year old phone call to ice led to this raid but whether or not the call ever took place that possibility is a product of the poisonous atmosphere fostered by politicians of both parties in mississippi
9314669 in the last election barbour and republicans campaigned against immigrants to get elected but so did all the democratic statewide candidates except attorney general jim hood the raid will make the climate even worse
9314670 for too long the matches against counties have been both embarrassment and farce

9314672 only three years after hurricanes katrina and rita devastated gulf of mexico oil and gas production an emerging hurricane storm is tracking another potentially lethal swath through americas energy heartland

9314674 in formula one you have to give someone half a year before you start to judge him
9314675 i would not say i already have a clear opinion on him but i also have to say started a couple of races before and he performed very well in the first half year
9314676 everyone will bring opinions and then we dietrich mateschitz and myself will try to find the right way for the team
9314677 at the end of the day the last word will come from red bull

9314697 i realized i wasnt like other girls when i was in 6th grade they were all becoming boy crazy and i didnt understand it my parents told me i was still young and it was weird for young girls to be attracted to young boys i was really confused because everyone was telling me different things in 7th grade guys started asking me out but i turned them down i didnt think i was gay every now and then id see some guy and think he was kinda cute but nothing ever became of it this past year ive just been staying out of it all because i just dont know i dont know if im gay i dont know if im straight maybe im neither
9314698 thats how i used to feel then i started becoming attracted to girls and then i just knew when the time comes youll know

9314705 i drove the ball well and i was never in a position to cause any angst or anxiety
9314706 but it was so cool the ball just wasnt going anywhere
9314707 i used the long putter for the first time this week and i made some putts yesterday and today
9314708 what i am most proud of was the play of our offensive line
9314709 we had three new starters in burkett kennedy and netter and if you include desmond taylor we had four new starters
9314710 i think we were able to come out with a victory because of the play of our offensive line they were opening up holes and i had a lot of time to throw i think they really dominated up front and thats what wins football games
9314711 coach fitz said to me earlier in the week what are you going to do when you throw your first pick
9314712 its been eight months of investment and today was our payday
9314713 its a great confidence booster to be able to come out and be able to depend upon what some might call an inexperienced offensive line youd swear they were out there two or three years blocking together
9314714 studies show that as many as 50 percent of donors to charities today will go to a web site first before making a gift
9314715 they may give offline but the web site is a powerful tool to help them make up their minds
9314716 i made a bet that if we exceeded 150 000 i would shave my head for a year
9314717 when we first started we had volunteers going door to door collecting a dollar at a time as other technologies developed weve leveraged them to take advantage of how americans behave and what is most convenient
9314718 its all about connecting the people that god has blessed with resources with the people in need
9314719 if we have someone on the ground in zimbabwe blogging about their day to day experiences we bring home the work overseas to here it makes it real
9314720 now more than ever before a charitys web site is its front door
9314721 so it hasnt been on my mind i know my dad couldnt make it up to the game hed normally be here but hes boarding up the house and everything
9314722 but theres more anxiety because of what happened last time
9314723 i dont think its that big a deal in anybodys mind right now
9314724 you get used to it its another storm it could end up not even hitting new orleans or louisiana well see what happens im ready for today and thats all thats on my mind
9314725 even though were up here in the northern part of louisiana

9314788 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
9314789 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
9314790 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
9314791 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
9314792 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea
9314793 we found out its probably the road noise and the motion
9314794 it didnt have much to do with the engine noise since theres no internal combustion engine
9314795 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9314796 one day when i was very young i remember my father taking me to the place where he worked some small children came and we all played together my father was a porter he used to load and unload trucks out of the money he got for that hed take me to the market and buy me clothes i was happy but then i was told that my father was dead my biggest memory of my mother is that she used to drink a lot of alcohol and when she did this she would have horrible fights with my father sometimes these fights would go on for two or three days shed fight with everybody it was terrible i used to be so frightened i remember the last time i saw her they had been having one of their fights and finally she stormed out of our house she didnt come back soon after that i was told that my mother had died right after the death of my mother things became very difficult for me i went to the market and spent all my time there i lived there day and night until the people from the childrens home found me and brought me here i met a few other children at the market that had no parents either we would move around in small groups for safety and look for scraps of food on the ground we lived on whatever we could find then when night came we would all find somewhere to sleep i was five years old
9314797 they used to smear red pepper on my eyes and nose that is just one of the things they would do to me during my life in the market they did that because they saw that there was no one to look after me or help i was very small compared to them i used to be so frightened that i couldnt sleep then when i did manage to sleep terrible dreams would come people would be attacking me beating me kicking me choking me i would wake up very upset i would try to find a different place to sleep in the hope that these nightmares would stop but the same dreams would always come back again sometimes i was only saved from them by the police or the soldiers who had come to arrest me thankfully those dreams are not there now
9314798 during war time most of the children that we met in the market they sleep in the market and live off leftover foods they are smoking opium and rubber solution and also dipping their clothes in petrol and breathing it the military that are on curfew at night they come and harass these children threaten the lives of the children and the older ones they are forced to be recruited there are actually other things happening that are beyond humanitarian and you see you dont expect a human being can do such an action to a child

9314880 il punto fondamentale avere un pm autonomo e indipendente ma anche efficiente il pm deve avere una regolamentazione ordinamentale diversa rispetto a quella del giudice non necessariamente separata questo non per assoggettare il pm allesecutivo come si afferma ma al contrario per esaltarne lindipendenza e lautonomia

9314958 the palestinian side was much more urgent more severe and even emotional in its insistence on the need for new history the reason is of course that israel and consequently most israelis are the dominant party in the conflict they hold all the territory have all the military power and can therefore take the time and have the luxury to sit back and let the debate unfold calmly

9315003 we were walking to the car when we were stopped in our tracks
9315004 there was a strange smell in the air it was very hard to describe it made us lift our heads up so we were facing a drystane dyke just a few feet away i couldnt believe what i saw
9315005 it was black and looked like a puma it was amazing to see its strength and agility when it leaped over the wall and away from us
9315006 i know we were very lucky to see what we had seen
9315007 we had only been drinking cups of tea that night
9315008 i was driving through shevington when i noticed something out of the corner of my eye hovering above some houses
9315009 i pulled over and kept watching it and it was the strangest thing
9315010 i had my video camera in my car with me so i took some footage of the object
9315011 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
9315012 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
9315013 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
9315014 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
9315015 we are in no way applauding what happened in shenandoah
9315016 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber

9315018 we want to find out how many illegal aliens are in our state right now where they live and what they are doing to earn a living
9315019 governor you cant say this but we can she is a cancer and she is nothing but a very jealous woman
9315020 well im going to say what i wish you could say lyda green is a bitch and she needs to go away because she is a cancer on the progress of the state of alaska
9315021 governor palin was caught off guard by bob lesters reference to senate president lyda green
9315022 lester asks palin point blank do you have any idea of what you did to make lyda green dislike you hate you
9315023 hang on grim we is going to alaska to visit that woman mccain likes

9315027 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years
9315028 i approached a long left bend where the later cars in the first pass had created a narrow line
9315029 i knew straight away that it was over because the oil temperature and water warning lights came on im disappointed because i lost points for myself and the team i was going so well and was pleased with my driving here so i thought i could finish second its a bad feeling but after my problems in germany ive learned that i have to pick myself up and carry on
9315030 this is a fantastic moment for me but it makes me think i am getting old
9315031 i still love racing though and have as much desire as i did when i started i used to look at 30 year old guys when i began at gps and think wow thats old but now i guess the young guys look at me and think that
9315032 i really want to thank everyone who has helped me in my career and it is great that i have broken this record with suzuki because working with them is just fantastic i now plan to go on to make 300 appearances win more races and get more podiums
9315033 it is obvious that for next year we want to improve over this year but we are still very satisfied
9315034 as we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brother in law
9315035 i said maam i need to keep you at arms length with this i cant deal about him with you if need be i can talk to todd
9315036 i tried to explain to him you cant head hunt like this
9315037 what you need to do is back off because if the trooper does make a mistake and it is a terminable offense if can look like political interference
9315038 i explained to her there as no new evidence the issue was closed she also was unhappy with that
9315039 when i was let go i was a little surprised there was not a warning shot or anything
9315040 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
9315041 really likes walt a lot but on this issue she doesnt know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue its very very troubling to her and the family
9315042 on the other hand the allegations pre date her election so there is some issue about whether it was truly motivated by public safety concerns or it was vindictiveness
9315043 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
9315044 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9315045 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9315046 ok folks on the count of 3 say wake up jose 123 not 1 2 3 but just 123 lol everyone says wake up jose and then literally 4 5 seconds after we say it he starts his show she was way ahead of the time delay seriously was this girl the brother of the guy driving the jungle boat

9315048 i shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds

9315058 the transcend study demonstrates the value of telmisartan in people who are unable to tolerate angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
9315059 although the benefit is of moderate size there is an impact on a range of outcomes including the composite of cardiovascular death myocardial infarction and strokes as well as cardiovascular hospitalizations given the large proportion of people who are unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor the use of telmisartan would be clinically important
9315060 the remarkable tolerability of telmisartan is emphasized by the fact that fewer individuals stop medication if they were receiving telmisartan compared to placebo
9315061 this is particularly noteworthy as all the individuals enrolled in the study were unable to tolerate an ace inhibitor which is a closely related class of agents
9315062 it was good but my start was not too good
9315063 i concentrated on winning and as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster time
9315064 theres still one race to go for the jackpot and the world record is closer now too though im not sure i can do it this year
9315065 it is difficult to accept that the real reason for shelving the bill is lack of proper consultation as alleged
9315066 we pooled all our resources and the guys are ready to work all through the night to ensure that people have electricity the weather conditions are not making it easy though
9315067 we are going through a period of denial as far as the skills shortage is concerned
9315068 by continuing to deny the problem we are doing more harm than we will ever know because we are destroying the ability to persuade young black south africans that the way forward is to get educated
9315069 seventy six percent of respondents said that they had experienced a scarcity of affirmative action candidates while there is certainly an unemployment problem in this country a survey like this shows that there is a lack of skilled people in specific fields
9315070 most of these categories require a level of experience that many unemployed people do not have
9315071 the scale of the problem has become bigger theres a need for us to up our game
9315072 it will be affecting the states performance as well as the economys ability to compete on the world stage
9315073 i think the problem is more serious than people believe we are still not seeing the full effect of it and will only feel it in five to 10 years time
9315074 if they really want to deal with the problem companies must come to the party who do they expect to solve the problem
9315075 they are thriving in the midst of confusion the role they are playing needs to be investigated
9315076 we were successful in obtaining resources from the indian government to assist with the enhancement of skills of south african public servants
9315077 the highest number of vacancies is for administrative office workers 19 percent but at least 31 percent of the vacancies are in the combined occupational categories of professionals including physical mathematical engineering science life science legal health and nursing technical and associate professionals
9315078 the initiative was designed to address a small number of urgent issues and the message from stakeholders is that it has made an important contribution we have managed to crack some hard nuts and encouraged people to make changes in terms of skills shortages

9315096 louise feels well and truly shafted rightly or wrongly she blames lesley for the break up of the marriage she knew lesley who used to socialise with her and david and considers shes been badly betrayed by a friend
9315097 lesley and david dated over ten years ago and have remained friends david is currently lodging with lesley but they are not romantically involved
9315098 it was very frustrating it was very very hard it was extremely hard
9315099 me and mario normally share a massive bed so to share this little bed together we had to go side on anyway the extremely hard bit which im sure you want to know about it got very hot very steamy and the sparks were flying it was very tempting there was a little bit of spice but youll have to use your imagination
9315100 far enough ha ha ha as far as you could within the means the trouble is that youre in a little bed side on and theres an occasional slippage ha ha ha
9315101 she is very very confident and way too in your space and thats where the problems came in

9315208 this made it the coolest august in terms of daytime temperatures since records began at the current site in 2000
9315209 in fact on the 18th the temperature struggled to just 17 degrees the coldest august day in three years
9315210 august was dominated by a ridge of high pressure sitting over southeast queensland for most of the month while cold fronts surged across the southeastern states
9315211 this ridge kept skies clear winds light and humidity down the perfect mix for very cold nights
9315212 these cold nights were then followed by cool sunny days
9315213 what theyre saying is that within a couple of days theyll know after hes taken the soup whether or not he has to take this operation
9315214 there may be a bit of argy bargy on the way through but i think its time to do this mr rudd told fairfax radio network today
9315215 were prepared to have an argument if thats necessary you cant simply allow our kids to be in schools which are consistently underperforming
9315216 we are moving to a system where we can compare apples with apples he said
9315217 i notice the liberals were saying that they had come up with some of these ideas in the past well thats terrific
9315218 twelve years they were in government 24 reports on boosting quality education in our schools and not much to show for it in terms of real action
9315219 from what we have seen it appears to be essentially a reheated coalition policy much of which has already been legislated he said
9315220 its punitive its saying principals perform or heads will roll she told reporters
9315221 its shifting responsibility for the educational outcomes of the nation onto the shoulders of principals and making them personally responsible when the government isnt adequately funding schools to be able to do the job
9315222 theres no point in the world with comparing a rich school on sydneys north shore with elizabeth north in south australia and how the school is going there she said
9315223 our whole plan is to analyse student population and compare like schools with like schools

9315227 it was very successful and i madea lot of money for a teenager
9315228 but i had an ulcer by the time i was 19 the following year my parents moved to arkansas so my father could pursue his dream of raising cattle and living in the country they were tired of the rat race too
9315229 he said that mit was aggressively seeking homeschoolers because they were incredible problem solvers who had been allowed to develop their own natural patterns of thinking through things
9315230 he pictured it this way babies develop beautiful antennas always exploring assimilating learning and expressing themselves
9315231 going to college is not an end all for me
9315232 if summer was passionate about something that required a college degree i would sell the house to make her dream come true but i dont see the point in her pursuing a degree just for the sake of having a degree
9315233 we both read to her all the time when she was little
9315234 were all three together all day every day we love each other
9315235 she was 3 1 2 years old and she would beg me to play school with her
9315236 she wanted to learn and so we enrolled in the calvert school an online college bound program out of baltimore when she graduated from that program two years ago we were surprised that she scored two years ahead of her peers in english and language
9315237 you cant shield them from the world but without the peer pressure other kids have shes more like a young person than a teenager her maturing has allowed us to connect as shes forming her own world view
9315238 most people seem to watch tv as a course of habit
9315239 or as a way of keeping up with the culture
9315240 some kids think im weird because ive never heard of the groups they are listening to but im not judgmental i like all kinds of music we should all be allowed to develop our own tastes
9315241 they greeted another girl who approached them and when she left one of the remaining girls said shes soo 2004 summer just isnt into that scene
9315242 she doesnt define herself by her possessions like other kids do
9315243 it never occurred to her that a phone should be cool
9315244 she isnt influenced by what other children think at all
9315245 older people have more stories to tell and know more about life they are just more interesting
9315246 a lot of kids dont have individual personalities they seem to be into what their friends are into they havent found themselves yet
9315247 number one ive always wanted to be an author number two id like to go to beauty school and number three i would love to become a dog trainer because i love animals
9315248 dad used to teach science but now hell help me with art projects for my lessons and he is so smart he is like a walking dictionary what i love about my parents is they have always been supportive of me
9315249 i would be different than i am now if i went to public school and i like myself the way i am

9315268 ok this lunch box is terrible you needa new one
9315269 this is all broken it could cut somebody i think weve gotten our moneys worth out of it
9315270 i wanted to pass down my passion for the sport
9315271 during the season i dont have time to see my friends
9315272 in my free time i try to spend time and catch up with my friends
9315273 its really hard to compete for gym space once basketball starts
9315274 its tough to be good at a sport when you dont play a lot
9315275 as a coach ive won national and regional titles but ive never won a state title
9315276 those times we would just kind of wrap ourselves around her to keep her from harming herself
9315277 to most spending requests for the year the answer is no but we will comply with the state and federal standards and meet the needs of our students
9315278 our 2008 09 budget has not yet been approved but well base it on last years budget i think we will come off the fiscal distress list by the end of this school year
9315279 i do have a love for people students and the undereducated i was not a good reader until my second year of college
9315280 the fact that i couldnt read well bothered me once my younger brother went to college i thought id give it a try my dad always believed in me and that continual encouragement to read helped finally my sophomore year in college something clicked and i became a better reader
9315281 i think teaching is calling from god the more i analyzed it the more i believed it is my calling
9315282 when i was at alread there were fiscal problems there and at shirley
9315283 i hope to bring diplomacy and fair equity back so everyone feels good about their school
9315284 this victory does so much more than just motivate this team
9315285 is simply to become the leading global provider of networked consumer electronics and entertainment
9315286 we have global scale we have great design and innovative engineering and we have entertainment content that can be married in creative ways with our devices
9315287 at sony pictures we possess one of the largest digitised libraies of premium movie and television content in the world and our music companies together have one of the most well known and valuable catalogues of masters and copyrights as well as a roster of world renowned music artists
9315288 at our corporate strategy meeting this summer we identified three key strategic initiatives critical to sonys success to strengthen our core businesses to make 90 per cent of our products network enabled and to capialise on international growth
9315289 first we will strengthen our core business even further this is a priority for us on an ongoing basis three years ago we had limited presence if any in the lcd television business but today weare competing for first place in worldwide market share due to the strength of our bravia lineup
9315290 sony was the first to bring the next generation of television technology oled to market as many of you have seen this television is only 3mm thick and has a brilliant contrast ratio of more than 1 000 000 1 that makes it very bright
9315291 we continue to improve our oled technology for larger televisions and other applications and we continue to grow our enormous digital imaging business where we maintain leading market share
9315292 as sony has clearly evolved into a global electronics and entertainment company i would to share with you some news about a highly anticipated sony pictures film and its ability to differentiate sony from all other companies
9315293 today i am delighted to announce a global marketing campaign from sony featuring daniel craig as james bond 007
9315294 developed as an artistic extension of the upcoming film quantum of solace which will be released in theatres worldwide by sony pictures this fall the campaign will highlight sonys high definition product capabilities while capturing the energy and intensity of the 22nd james bond adventure
9315295 this is the first time we have integrated our film and electronics marketing efforts at such a profound level bringing together sonys leadership in high definition with one of the worlds most powerful and iconic movie franchises
9315296 use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with russia
9315297 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9315298 there can be no return to business as usual until russia commits fully to georgias territorial integrity and withdraws to its previous positions
9315299 i think it is time for the prime minister to look at himself and decide whether he is still fit to be prime minister
9315300 if he still holds onto office the problems of the country will escalate
9315301 aggressive behavior is my nature it is not indecent behavior
9315302 i did not do anything wrong and have the right to continue my work as prime minister
9315303 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9315304 we ran for our lives and now we are dying here for food
9315305 we are dying even for clothes all our animals are also dying
9315306 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore
9315307 i was really really close i was offered a job and i was going to take it and start on the monday
9315308 but i spoke to my father and he said no dont that would be pretty stupid
9315309 luckily i didnt and its all worked out quite well
9315310 i never thought id play for australia for it to happen is quite unbelieveable
9315311 in normal circumstances the additional player added to the australia squad would come from those selected for australia a
9315312 with only two one day internationals remaining in darwin and 12 fit players however its unlikely that any replacement player would play in either of these matches
9315313 given the importance of the australia a tour of india where players will have an opportunity to press for test selection in the upcoming australia india series it was decided that a young emerging player should be added to the national team to gain experience
9315314 ja ik ben blij dat ik gewonnen hebt maar er waren nog mensen van mijn niveau
9315315 diene is zo wette allez da ik zo iets heb van oh my god
9315316 wir hatten gro e angst es war ein gro es zittern f r die ganze familie und unter dieser voraussetzung k nnen wir ihm nicht mehr erlauben fu ball zu spielen
9315317 mit der angst kann ich nicht leben wenn ich nach jedem spiel zittern muss ob er nach hause kommt

9315321 we had more people today than weve ever had in the 29 year old history of the event
9315322 i think people are looking for a destination for labor day weekend
9315323 i think its bigger than anything they do in napa
9315324 i served 1 000 people in one and a half hours
9315325 weve brought in nine all star sommeliers who represent a whole new wave of superstars in the world of food and wine
9315326 and the mauritson rockpile ridge was a study in zinfandel it was maybe the most complex wine at the tasting
9315327 its a root beer braised pork belly with a brown butter hollandaise aioli
9315328 i used oak hill farms tomatoes and a hampshire pig they are fatty goodness
9315329 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9315330 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9315331 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9315332 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9315333 raising taxes at this time is something that will definitely damage and hinder this economy at this time
9315334 force the legislature to stop their reckless overspending once and for all
9315335 carpenters in those days would tightly fold the newspaper stick it in their back pocket and take it to work to read during a break or at lunch
9315336 the governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide
9315337 its outrageous that the obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved
9315338 this has been a tumultuous week in the department of public safety and as your governor i apologize
9315339 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9315340 i think it raises the profile but it doesnt really change the mission or the work
9315341 had threatened to kill my dad and bring me down
9315342 for the record no one ever said fire wooten not the governor not todd not any of the other staff
9315343 what they said directly was more along the lines of this isnt a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers
9315344 palin again brought up wooten in february 2007 as she and monegan were walking together to wish a state senator a happy birthday monegan said he said he told palin he had to keep her at arms distance on the matter and she agreed
9315345 this is a governor who really built her name by stepping on the back of sinners randy ruedrich greg renkes frank murkowski
9315346 and now her administration seems to be taking the same approach as the people that she criticized
9315347 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9315348 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9315349 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9315350 an admirable person and she will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9315351 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9315352 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9315353 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer
9315354 a lot of my friends and colleagues will be there
9315355 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9315356 when he said damn this is good that was all i needed to hear
9315357 nobody is going to help your family as well as your family
9315358 im guaranteeing there will be some brawls but this has made us all better people
9315359 if we are going to bicker over small things then we really have problems
9315360 well have our hands full when we get home but well be home
9315361 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9315362 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9315363 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9315364 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9315365 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9315366 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day
9315367 im sure that if governor haley barbour thought senator mccain and governor palins presence would in any way distract from the important work theyre doing in advance of the storm he wouldnt have invited them
9315368 they need to know and i know they know they are in our prayers
9315369 we need to be sensitive to this as we go forward
9315370 are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to minnesota
9315371 mccain needs a good convention gustav is making that tough
9315372 everybody is aware of the devastating tv split screen potential here
9315373 the affected governors are all major leaguers with close ties to mccain the best political antennas in the party are tuned in to this
9315374 to make sure the states were receiving all the assistance they needed from the federal government
9315375 we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9315376 our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9315377 presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as john s mccain
9315378 were just hoping that people will heed the forecast and weather warnings
9315379 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9315380 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive
9315381 if theyre gang members send them to jail and let the judge handle it
9315382 they are illegals who have never worked in the fields theyve embraced the american criminal lifestyle
9315383 tried to use every resource that we can to be effective in dealing with our gang problems we realized as a community we did not want gangs to get out of control like they have in other places
9315384 were not going to become immigration agents were not after illegal aliens were going after criminal gang members
9315385 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9315386 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9315387 you know it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9315388 vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations
9315389 the embodiment of the generosity that comes with grace and the fearlessness that comes from knowing what really matters
9315390 senator i am 83 years old two days ago you provided me and many in this nation the opportunity to see something that we thought we would never in our lifetimes see
9315391 folks ive never seen in all my time in washington where so many people have been knocked down and our government has done so little to help them get back up
9315392 i could walk from here to cleveland and i wouldnt run into a single person who told me they felt the economy was strong unless i ran into john mccain
9315393 doesnt see the economy the same way barack and i do or i suspect any of you do
9315394 they always say he was a maverick and this made me think well he really is he went all the way to alaska there arent that many people up there they dont have that many electoral votes and he picked this person i know people will say shes inexperienced but shes been a governor for 20 months thats more experience than obama has
9315395 no one in my office has any idea about her and the only comment im hearing which is not good is that shes a woman and thats why she was picked
9315396 its so blatantly a political move picking a woman at all and then picking a woman with so little experience when he keeps ramming obama about his experience
9315397 the fact that shes a working mom will send a message to america that you dont have to choose children over career
9315398 with her being so unknown to be that close to taking over
9315399 at his age he picked a woman with little experience thats scary
9315400 to have some kind of recognition for a young life well lived
9315401 i know hes a millionaire and hes got the funds

9315416 it is hard and requires a big commitment of resources and people

9315450 new book out and making the move to open access
9315451 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
9315452 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
9315453 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
9315454 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
9315455 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
9315456 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
9315457 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
9315458 trying to be voice of community to bring people in and engage people who feel a digital divide who feel excluded from technology our core user group
9315459 its a platform for people to come together and make a community on their own terms its not about us dictating what the community will be but consulting with community to see what they need
9315460 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
9315461 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
9315462 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
9315463 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
9315464 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
9315465 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
9315466 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found

9315472 its tough its frustrating starting the year off again like this
9315473 to come in this place and hear the silence of this crowd is a feeling you cant describe
9315474 i would hope this first game is the worst one
9315475 nick competed well and steve gave us a lift and came in and made a few plays
9315476 theres a few things im sure both of them would have back but at the same time i thought both of them did a good job for the first time out there
9315477 in the second half i saw a spark i saw something in the whole team
9315478 weve been running into more and more people who arent gun friendly
9315479 you go and do it and now where is everybody that wants to do it
9315480 its not different than if they were having a firearms display
9315481 its like losing all control of your entire body you cant move it completely immobilizes you
9315482 it could be used by a spouse against a spouse a parent against a child
9315483 even for believers of course the phrase god bless you functions more as a rhetorical device than a statement of fact or belief god does not respond to intercessory prayers as though they were commands
9315484 as an independent do you think youll switch and vote for mccain
9315485 do you think were that stupid to cast our vote one way because of gender
9315486 david miliband the immediate instinct of the prime minister and i is clear speak out against aggression
9315487 even after 25 years this cars refinement and quality shows through particularly on the highway
9315488 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods
9315489 but their numbers are in lakhs hundreds of thousands and we require more resources more boats army and rescue efforts to evacuate them
9315490 i presented my buffalo to the boatman in exchange for a place in his boat since i dont have any money
9315491 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely make sure weve contacted both fema but also private relief organizations just to make sure that whatever happens people are prepared
9315492 if barack obamas rise teaches us anything it ought to be this it is insulting to voters of color and white candidates alike to cordon off specific districts as belonging to one race or another
9315493 dispersal of blacks into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters
9315494 some black scholars such as lani guinier and carol swain have noted that there are nonlegislative benefits to black representation
9315495 for instance each acknowledges the psychic benefits black voters may derive by being represented by people who look like them
9315496 when i ran in 2006 there were some who said that i shouldnt aspire to represent this district i was not deaf to the calls by some in the black political community that this should be a black seat however my view is that the seat should go to the person who works the hardest knocks on the most doors in every part of the district and espouses ideas that appeal throughout the district
9315497 i was on a mission to close the gap on the ford team but got onto the wrong part of the road on a long left hand corner and had the spin
9315498 i wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance but then it all changed and we were leading again
9315499 this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9315500 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but its a race and these things happen sometimes
9315501 i was really confident that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9315502 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third but im not going to let this knock my confidence
9315503 i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9315504 we want to win not get fourth im sorry but were not here for fun we have to improve the speed
9315505 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9315506 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9315507 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9315508 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9315509 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9315510 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9315511 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9315512 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9315513 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9315514 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9315515 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9315516 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9315517 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9315518 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9315519 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9315520 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9315521 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9315522 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9315523 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9315524 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9315525 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9315526 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9315527 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9315528 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9315529 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9315530 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9315531 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9315532 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9315533 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9315534 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9315535 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9315536 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9315537 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9315538 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9315539 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9315540 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9315541 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9315542 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9315543 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9315544 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9315545 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9315546 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9315547 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9315548 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9315549 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9315550 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9315551 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9315552 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9315553 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9315554 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9315555 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9315556 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9315557 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9315558 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9315559 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9315560 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9315561 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9315562 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9315563 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9315564 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9315565 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9315566 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9315567 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9315568 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9315569 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9315570 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9315571 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9315585 where is that bag of money and when do i get my hands on it
9315586 this is a question you have posed numerous times dominic and the answer is linc aint getting it the money is at the bottom of a lagoon in panama when the authorities came and dredged the shallow area for clues to the murder of company operative bill kim they found the bag there were just a couple of bad apples in the normally trustworthy panamanian police but thats all it takes youll probably find some panamanian cops with speedboats and vacation homes
9315587 we won the final two old firm games of last season and a lot of that was down to the fact that we got in rangers faces
9315588 we didnt let them play their passing game and went out to win our individual duels
9315589 its so important to win the battles the football will take care of itself
9315590 we also tried to play stuff at a good tempo
9315591 apart from marc crosas all our midfielders have experience of old firm games and know what is needed to win
9315592 rangers have mendes who looks quality but you dont always get the chance to put your foot on the ball in this fixture its not about pretty football
9315593 it can be 100 miles per hour and its hard to catch your breath its totally different from every other spl game this is a crucial match we want to win
9315594 rangers will be the same but ferguson is a loss for them he is the captain and knows what this fixture is about
9315595 we feel the addition of pablo is another great signing for manchester city
9315596 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9315597 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9315598 i am very happy to come here and play in the premier league playing in england has been a lifelong dream which has finally come true by moving to city
9315599 id met him hughes previously and was really impressed with him but having talked to him about manchester city i had to come here and be part of his plans
9315600 you look at being cut from the broncos after only two years as a professional rugby player thats why im probably harder on the younger players than some others because i know how fickle it is and how quickly it can all go
9315601 if youre going to take up peoples time and present to them then you need to make sure what youre saying is correct and to make sure that youre putting in the time and that you show them the courtesy that you know what youre going to talk about beforehand setanta readers comment of the day

9315609 weve not been allowed to meet him since the day he was arrested there were rumors about geelani sahib not feeling well and he being admitted in skims there were even rumors about he was shifted to new delhi for treatment
9315610 the criminal silence maintained by the authorities about his whereabouts and health has caused lots of worries to the family members and his party rank and file
9315611 weve been running from pillar to post for knowing where he has been lodged but till now officials have not responded
9315612 all of us including people want to know where is mirwaiz and how is he fearing
9315613 if whereabouts of mirwiaz geelani sahib and other leaders are not provided we will defy the curfew and take to the roads
9315614 we asked them where has he been lodged but they didnt divulge any details
9315615 he is very much safe and sound dont worry about him
9315616 after he was arrested cops came here and told us to hand over his clothes and medicines
9315617 weve got directions from new delhi not to disclose where he has been lodged
9315618 i hope he is fine he is suffering from various ailments
9315619 we asked the policemen under which section has he been booked but they refused to divulge the details
9315620 i feel like a dead person i was gone i become crazy
9315621 i didnt care at this point i was ready to die
9315622 rendition as currently practiced is undermining our moral credibility and standing abroad and weakening the coalitions with foreign governments that we need to effectively combat international terrorism

9315626 granted access to the detained terrorists at guant namo and heard their claims
9315627 produced solid information that has contributed directly to the disruption of terrorist activities
9315628 we have an ongoing confidential dialogue with members of the us intelligence community and we would share any observations or recommendations with them
9315629 if any unilateral decision about handing over the land back to amarnath shrine board is taken it will have far reaching consequences
9315630 if cc is ignored and land is transferred back to the board it can lead to bigger rebellion in the kashmir valley
9315631 time has come to implement the recommendations of the working groups which include opening of srinagar muzaffarabad road for trade and hold dialogue with the separatist leaders
9315632 if new delhi continues to suppress the people of kashmir it will lead to their further alienation curfew and restrictions on press and media are not going to help
9315633 weve to take the aspirations of both regions into consideration before coming to a conclusion i am very much concerned about the situation in jammu as well as kashmir
9315634 i met the prime minister today and apprised him about the present situation in kashmir i also put forward my point of view and the apprehensions we have

9315636 were fighting them over there so we dont have to fight them over here
9315637 its the taxpayers and electric customers that are taken to the cleaners
9315638 renewable energy is not going to happen unless those policies are in place
9315639 would be a major major setback for all renewable energies
9315640 when you give subsidies it disrupts the market forces and thats certainly the case with wind too
9315641 they could be producing a lot more electricity than were buying
9315642 they sign a contract and put up security which is at risk if they dont come on line
9315643 it attracts private investment because investors can see the state has a long term commitment to renewable energy
9315644 it shows investors were going to get at least some money from the rec payments
9315645 you cant count on windmills to be available at high demand times which are warm summer afternoons
9315646 id rather have that money stay in the u s in the hands of small towns in new york so people can spend it locally
9315647 we will voice our many concerns and unanswered questions at the planning and zoning meeting in st peter on monday september 15
9315648 we are not opposed to wind energy and in fact think that wind energy is a top choice for electric power going green into the future however there are places much better suited than this area for wind turbines
9315649 we the surrounding landowners including the three landowners who have signed the leases with the new ulm puc have opposed this project from the start
9315650 what is happening is they nupuc have made application for a meteorological tower for an anemometer to measure and record wind speed we of course have had a couple phone calls regarding that the tower is all that is going to be on there but theyre still going to come and voice their concerns
9315651 the only thing that is going to take place is that the planning and zoning is going to make a recommendation based on the meteorological tower application no wind turbine
9315652 what we have to do is place the tower about 1 000 feet away from where the turbine will be on the prevailing wind side of it
9315653 none of them said anything and they all signed the leases one of them even sought us out about leasing land even when we were just starting out looking

9315655 little known fact the northern lights are really just the reflection from sarah palins eyes
9315656 little known fact sarah palin doesnt need a gun to hunt she has been known to throw a bullet through an adult bull elk
9315657 little known fact the russians sold alaska to america because sarah palin would not submit to autocracy
9315658 its an insult to the memory of turner and wordsworth the idea that you can even consider ruining the landscape of an area of such outstanding beauty that it inspired our greatest artists and poets is ludicrous what does it say about the culture we have in this country to build and build without due consideration of the impact it is having on our countryside
9315659 we appreciate that the proposal is emotive the estate is one of the many interested parties and we must rely on the democratic process so that the arguments for and against are heard
9315660 to live only 1 000ft from a 410ft turbine in a quiet rural setting is frightening for us the machines will completely and utterly dominate the landscape and the noise emitted will be overbearing
9315661 our proposed investment is part of a wider strategy which is also seeing us invest in hydropower schemes and new combined heat and power plants our wind turbines at chelker have been an established part of the landscape for more than 17 years providing 15 per cent of our on site energy needs the turbines we wish to construct are much more technologically advanced we believe the size we have chosen is the best fit for this site
9315662 we will consider the application in light of both local and national policy we have gone to great lengths to carry out a detailed assessment which is ongoing it will be up to elected members to make the right decision
9315663 its the same as growing your own vegetables versus going to the store and buying them
9315664 because all that food at the store comes from some far off place whose location you dont know
9315665 theres a phenomenon called nimby not in my back yard
9315666 its when most people dont see alternative energy as bad but just not in their yard

9315739 he came to chambal when he lost delhi his followers used to loot they took pride in making their living at the edge of a sword later during the 1857 war of independence the rani of jhansi attacked gwalior the army was broken in spirit and torn apart between the loyalist scindias and the freedom fighters as a result there was a lot of rebellion and looting camels laden with treasure were whisked away
9315740 they began by looting treasure from the scindia government when it was transported through forests on bullock carts for the sake of safety and clout they increased the size of the gang they were also known for cutting off the noses and ears of their enemies
9315741 of course we were masters of our region it was hard work but we had no cares dongar baturi had once caught a deputy inspector general of police from rajasthan not for ransom just for fun they liked to use disguises madho singh was an educated man he used to perform magic shows just for fun
9315742 but would give to anybody who came asking we touched only the rich and wouldnt hurt a woman even if she were loaded with gold
9315743 a woman helped us she brought a man down from delhi and we kidnapped him he paid up the ransom and later after wed surrendered he came to visit us in prison he brought gifts for each man he must have spent lakhs on us
9315744 we were good to the pakad kidnap victim we used to tell his relatives if we dont send back your man five kilos heavier you can take back all your ransom wed wash the clothes of the pakad and even shine his shoes if asked to todays gangs are only driven by greed these are goondas they will take money from anyone anyhow they insult and abuse good men they want wine and women
9315745 man singh used to tell us that if you place 10 tonnes on a mans head he cannot stand so we would think about how much burden a family could afford but that has changed earlier if we took one rupee from a man we undertook to keep him safe if a village supported us wed even offer to bring back their stolen buffaloes now theres too much bribery everywhere in our time we never met any policemen or tried to pay them off we faced at least two encounters a month there was rain and cold and thorns and mountains and loneliness a dacoits life wasnt an easy one
9315746 even today people kill for less than rs 50 chambal is not a particularly violent place in comparison elsewhere people loot in different ways but are not labelled dacoits we have a tradition here thats all
9315747 once in the court room the judge asked me the same question i answered judge
9315748 they distribute money to the locals to create permanent allies the robin hood image is a false one if they wanted to help the poor theyd give away 90 per cent of what they make clearly that isnt happening they give to the poor as a survival tactic not for altruistic motives
9315749 kidnapping is the most profitable activity today rather than looting
9315750 and youll find that the whos who of madhya pradesh is involved including politicians there are vested interests in dacoit gangs
9315751 we would go to a village and order them to vote for a candidate they used to listen to us
9315752 if we had money to fight court cases we would not have become dacoits ive even forgotten what my original dispute was about but there were laathis and there was a fight and somebody got killed it was a little thing
9315753 the problem is that the police force was made by the british for their own purposes it was made for the bureaucracy to protect the government it wasnt ever intended for the poor if it was things might have been different

9315800 its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9315801 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9315802 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9315803 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9315804 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9315805 my wife knew nothing about this woman but she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had
9315806 dozens of emails and the phones have been ringing off the hook
9315807 they were taunting me saying mccains going to disappoint you
9315808 boy what kind of prayers have you been saying for mccain
9315809 he went and chose a pentecostal for his running mate
9315810 finally we can get 100 behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9315811 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of as his running mate
9315812 while wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9315813 every shooter every hunter every gun owner every competitor needs to understand that it is time to in the words of bruce willis cowboy the f
9315814 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9315815 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9315816 palin could play strong in the sporting states like michigan ohio and pennsylvania depending on how they use her
9315817 most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they dont know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene but among sportsmen authenticity counts and palins got that and then some
9315818 i can tell you that this pick tells millions in the base of the party that they can trust mccain more specifically that they can trust him with supreme court picks and other key appoitments
9315819 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9315820 one scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow the other re arranged his schedule and is flying in wednesday i got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the mccain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for mccain sans the candidate before the thursday deadline when mccain shifts to the public financing system i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grassroots like this
9315821 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9315822 the choice is to shore up the conservative pro drilling base
9315823 this is an aggressive on offense pick not a defensive pick
9315824 he floated the pro abortion running mate then there was his performance at the saddleback debate and then you had the lieberman headfake and now this
9315825 every year about 1 5 lakh students go abroad for higher studies if we have a strong educational infrastructure within the country we can save such a big amount being spent abroad
9315826 today the scenario is so bad that teachers are appointed on contract basis and those who teach students of middle standard are barely matriculates such teachers are hired for remuneration as low as rs 1500 2500 per month
9315827 this can only be done by increasing more universities and more universities in turn means further shortage of teachers
9315828 this gives us a platform to take off to the developed nation status as far as engineering education is concerned
9315829 les officiels russes qui ont autoris la signature de ces contrats auraient d tre emprisonn s
9315830 other than bringing a set of ovaries to this ticket
9315831 no one will ever care about this scandal shes involved in on a national scale
9315832 think blink or sleep on it the impact of modes of thought on complex decision making
9315833 if you have to make decisions you have to do your homework
9315834 i did some research to try to figure out why the dutch had been able to see differences we hadnt
9315835 both cars in the experiment were equal so i would expect roughly equal numbers of the subjects to chose each car
9315836 its overly bold to recommend that as a way of making decisions
9315837 but that doctor has 20 to 30 years of experience and has in the past employed deliberate decision making so maybe over time these decisions become automated
9315838 going with your gut may be right when youre an expert for example maybe choosing lunch every day is easy because we do it every day but we dont move every day so when making a choice about where to live we have no expertise
9315839 revelations in the case particularly in the past six to eight weeks cast a shadow over the operations of the afp under mick keelty
9315840 in a matter of this significance and importance mr keelty would have been aware of what was going on every step of the way he should stand down until such time as john clarke finalises his report
9315841 one point i would make with great force is this in australia political interference in police investigations and prosecutions is not a feature
9315842 independent statutory office holders in this case the australian federal police make determinations in these matters i have never interfered at any time in any investigation even though there may have been some who wanted me to do so
9315843 id expect members of the legal profession to have more respect for justice clarkes inquiry than to pre empt its outcome with this call the men and women of the australian federal police refute the call the association members have confidence in mr keelty the members also hold their own professionalism at the forefront of their credibility
9315844 hear the matter in public with no regard for evidence or process
9315845 our client remains upset he has been described on an ongoing basis as person of interest it has cast a pall of suspicion over him
9315846 mr keelty has led the charge on these comments these events must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure
9315847 the afp and mr keelty are out on a limb especially as the investigation has been extensive and has cost over 8 million of australian taxpayers money
9315848 his tenure must surely be called into question but this a matter for the government not me
9315849 we have sought from this governmenta judgment on the conduct of the afp and the multiplicity of its apparent breaches of the law in this case
9315850 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9315851 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9315852 force these remote people out of their communal ways it really denies the uniqueness of who the indigenous people are and what their contribution to this country can be in their own right as if they having nothing to contribute except the absorption of the culture that the west has offered to us its a pretty damnable statement if thats the case
9315853 were not living normal lives were totally over represented in the social indicators were dying a lot younger we dont have the education opportunities people are living below the poverty line in many parts of australia it is not just those in northern australia who are battling to make ends meet
9315854 i think thats one of our if weve got a perceived strength its our capacity to mix in any group at any level scouts kids indigenous groups overseas dignitaries soldiers old people
9315855 i think its inaccuracy but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that
9315856 it really promotes the urban remote divide and that is really quite wrong
9315857 im just disappointed that he should go out on a note like that when we know theres been a lot of emphasis on remote areas and the difficulties there but there are huge huge difficulties in urban australia and we need to bridge that gap
9315858 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9315859 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9315860 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in child care at six weeks i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth
9315861 large amounts of research are coming in showing that particularly for children under two but also under three child care is generally likely to be harmful to them
9315862 but i think our economic situation has made things more difficult for families they struggle to keep one parent home
9315863 a lot of other people dont have that and need to go back to work when their children are young because its a financial struggle to stay home obviously every parent would try to find the best care
9315864 over 65 per cent of families have both parents working and for a lot of people its not about choice its because they have to
9315865 they both have to be earning money to pay off the mortgage
9315866 i think it does amazing wonders for their social skills
9315867 i dont see anything thats gone terribly wrong putting them into child care
9315868 the underlying assumption is that parents can make a more valuable contribution to the economy if they leave their children with someone else and go out to work
9315869 the city of sydney and the police are working together to do some good things in the oxford street and kings cross districts and we urge the government to increase the resources so that we can continue to do them across the city
9315870 we want the city rangers to be more proactive in the sense that they can be a visible presence and move people on
9315871 they have certain powers now and we want plenty of city rangers around at this time
9315872 the lockout trial will cease at the start of september
9315873 weve not been allowed to meet him since the day he was arrested there were rumors about geelani sahib not feeling well and he being admitted in skims there were even rumors about he was shifted to new delhi for treatment
9315874 the criminal silence maintained by the authorities about his whereabouts and health has caused lots of worries to the family members and his party rank and file
9315875 weve been running from pillar to post for knowing where he has been lodged but till now officials have not responded
9315876 all of us including people want to know where is mirwaiz and how is he fearing
9315877 if whereabouts of mirwiaz geelani sahib and other leaders are not provided we will defy the curfew and take to the roads
9315878 we asked them where has he been lodged but they didnt divulge any details
9315879 he is very much safe and sound dont worry about him
9315880 after he was arrested cops came here and told us to hand over his clothes and medicines
9315881 weve got directions from new delhi not to disclose where he has been lodged
9315882 i hope he is fine he is suffering from various ailments
9315883 we asked the policemen under which section has he been booked but they refused to divulge the details
9315884 mi dispiace se sono stato pensieroso ultimamente cara stavo solo riflettendo su quanto tu sia affettuosa intelligente e sensibile ed a quanto sia stato fortunato io ad incontrarti

9315898 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9315899 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9315900 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9315901 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9315902 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9315903 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9315904 it is very important for the eu now to reassess its relationship with russia and send a very clear message
9315905 i do not think the measures looked at tomorrow should be cheap or quick this requires clear and united and patient firmness over a sustained period of time
9315906 tomorrows summit must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9315907 i will also be pressing european leaders to increase funding for a project to allow us to source energy from the caspian sea reducing our dependence on russia
9315908 one of the passengers told the crew that she saw sparks out of the number four engine on the right wing earlier in the night
9315909 the thing thats sticking in the craw of a lot of people all the first class and business class people flew within a few hours
9315910 the poor old economy punters are still here if it was a near disaster in the air its going to ripple into a decent one out of the air
9315911 there were no safety issues at any time engineers will investigate the cause of the issue
9315912 weve got a night booked in hong kong and were going to paris tomorrow
9315913 weve booked a nights accommodation but by the time we get there weve just about done our money
9315914 i had a few runner up finishes which is nice financially but there is nothing like winning a tournament it is truly satisfying
9315915 i was solid on the back nine i was thinking that if i shot a six under today ill be happy no matter what the outcome even if i had not won there was no real pressure and my putting was average today
9315916 the eagle was great i struck a solid drive and then almost holed my second shot i told myself that i had to play solid and everything came together i got ahead of myself on a few holes but i kept a steady momentum and im very happy with my finish
9315917 my iron play was good so i thought i could be aggressive on the 15th hole i was too fast off the tee and the ball found the water i also bogeyed the 17th hole but a good game by scott who played well under these challenging conditions there are still more tournaments to play this year so i hope to follow my rhythm and stay in contention
9315918 it was a bad round i was pressing for a win it was my real chance to win without having to do anything spectacular as all i had to do was shoot a 2 under i am disappointed but i hope to put myself in a similar position in future events

9315932 we usually celebrate ramadan as a month of prayers and inner joy but this time round it is hard to celebrate it with the same fervour
9315933 bolts side has informed us that he will not be able to compete in daegu because of his busy schedule
9315934 after extensive news coverage about all this nasty behind the scenes scandal troopergate which is definitely not squeaky clean palins approval ratings fell to 67 still high but a far cry from the 90 number thats being thrown around so glibly by the republicans today alaskans are quickly becoming disillusioned once again
9315935 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here
9315936 she is also sueing the federal government over listing the polar bears as a threatened species
9315937 shes favored the trans canada proposal that will run the pipeline through canada in effect shipping us jobs over the border
9315938 so choosing a woman because you think her gender will get votes is insulting
9315939 are you kidding me first of all a vp candidate suing the fed govt
9315940 we dont need to worry about global warming we dont need to save the earth jesus already did that
9315941 but bear in mind that the 90 approval rating came from one of the most conservative and reddest of the red states out there
9315942 after extensive news coverage about all this nasty behind the scenes scandal which is definitely not squeaky clean palins approval ratings fell to 67 still high
9315943 can you imagine her negotiating a nuclear non proliferation treaty discussing foreign policy understanding non alaskan issues
9315944 but bear in mind that the 90 approval rating came from one of the most conservative and reddest of the red states out there
9315945 after extensive news coverage about all this nasty behind the scenes scandal which is definitely not squeaky clean palins approval ratings fell to 67 still high
9315946 i cant believe a guy that handsome wouldnt have some impact
9315947 use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with russia
9315948 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9315949 there can be no return to business as usual until russia commits fully to georgias territorial integrity and withdraws to its previous positions
9315950 i was looking at the parking and getting a feel for what the needs are for the court water district and library
9315951 were over the contingency and i dont know where the funding will come from beyond that
9315952 maybe it will come out of savings down the road or from general revenue
9315953 the decisions to use the moneys to supplement the city hall project occurred despite the repeated forecast of a softening economy
9315954 were on schedule with the structural steel foundation and metal deck
9315955 the city is doing site improvements paving parking lots and drives
9315956 i incline to think that the strongest feeling mother ever allowed herself was severe irritation while father no doubt knew all about boredom
9315957 felt slightly cheap as if i had buried my parents in a paper bag rather than a proper coffin
9315958 a better quality of holy ghost coming down at pentecost
9315959 the least microbe or the greatest mammal deserves our attention the geological history of our planet is as intimately entwined with the history of the life on its surface as the symbiosis between tree and truffle
9315960 i have a crazy mother who owns a hundred dusty bibles a leggy boy with a too soft heart and no man to bed down with and an alaskan silver dying on my kitchen floor
9315961 officer id like to report a missing pair of pants
9315962 she tried to soften her eyes into an empty catastrophic look but the more determined expression wore its way through
9315963 couldnt tell if taia was offering her a favor or asking for one just as she couldnt judge if her friends kept things to themselves to protect her feelings or because they found her irrelevant
9315964 were so worried here about appearing intrusive everything was the opposite of fergana but she could get used to it
9315965 might be time that you and i started asking god for different things
9315966 in the universe she inhabited it didnt matter what you did as long as you were able to formulate a response to it afterward
9315967 trying to escape your tedious fate only led you back to it
9315968 sensed in him a new kind of silence the tormented endurance of a child waiting to speak
9315969 when he quit dangling his foot rubbing it on the carpet he looked up at her
9315970 calling his mother for the first time by her name
9315971 use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with russia

9315974 i came out of the project far less worried about the earth than when i went into it
9315975 were giving it a battering that now ranks among historys major extinction episodes but as ive learned it always rebounds in amazing new ways
9315976 all i need to know i learned from my cat
9315977 this story about a baby sea serpent who lands in a little girls bathtub and their conflicted quest to get him back to the sea thoroughly charmed my daughter and me could be that our summer has had all the same elements swimming look how big i am now and getting ready to head off to pre school for the first time
9315978 taking the opportunity to get nothing done for a while something that experience has shown is a big part of boatbuilding
9315979 look a little beat but itll hold things together unless youve got a shed full of dough and youre aiming for perfection
9315980 good time on the fresh breeze going tack on tack across gansett bight

9315982 the sea provides food transportation and recreation the shoreline is at once a boundary an attraction a source of livelihood and a hazard
9315983 a growing awareness that densely populated shorelines pose a risk to life and property
9315984 like beachcombing tide pooling is an activity in which we go down to the waters edge to see what we can see the great thing about both is that the experience is never the same twice by what chance does one pool fill with inflated green algae and the other with clumps of brown moss animals the longer you look the more you see suddenly the tide pool becomes an entire ocean an ecosystem unto itself until a sea gulls cry interrupts your trance and you look up the moment erased by the brilliant sun glaring off the rocks
9315985 the nuclear reactor at chernobyl melts down i was visiting friends in phoenix
9315986 an anthology of stories that we constantly edit and from which we extract ever new meanings

9316002 we feel the addition of pablo is another great signing for manchester city
9316003 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9316004 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9316005 i am very happy to come here and play in the premier league playing in england has been a lifelong dream which has finally come true by moving to city
9316006 id met him previously and was really impressed with him but having talked to him about manchester city i had to come here and be part of his plans
9316007 what makes this situation different from what happened three years ago is that the state has pre positioned commodities and resources like food and water ready to roll once this thing hits
9316008 its been quiet for a few years and were hoping people havent become apathetic
9316009 i dont like it going someplace you dont know people you dont know
9316010 and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9316011 the mission i have assigned them is to conduct counterinsurgency operations in the maywand district where they will work alongside afghan national security forces
9316012 this district is a key district its key as a logistics hub for the movement of insurgent arms fighters and money the presence of 2 2 infantry will disrupt these activities and have a real impact on the security picture of kandahar province
9316013 but it was only today when the official announcement came that they had been placed under the control of thompson
9316014 were not there yet but with the addition of this very capable infantry battalion from the u s army were moving in the right direction
9316015 that will be announced and decided at the capital level not here in the field
9316016 up to five million afghans face severe food shortages yet the appeal for afghanistan has a huge funding shortfall with less than a fifth of the us 404 million needed to respond and not enough staff to organize and coordinate the massive aid effort required

9316018 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9316019 gulf of mexico and northern gulf coast should closely monitor the progress of gustav

9316029 i believe that governor sarah palins conservative credentials fight against corruption and stance on energy security along with her leadership experience as mayor of wasilla and governor of alaska make her the best qualified candidate for vice president of the united states

9316060 cooperation between the local and federal government appears to be good but he will continue to monitor it
9316061 what happened was a huge violation of my rights as an author not to mention me as a human being
9316062 feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun
9316063 we have made contact we have spoken with him we are just waiting to see whether its possible
9316064 weve got three matches left and we need something to happen
9316065 they overseas players have to be here for a period of 21 days
9316066 but he is keen hes desperate to get back into the pakistan side and is hoping this could be a springboard to do that
9316067 if it does go through we hope it could be of great benefit to us all
9316068 ganz am anfang dann wenn man mit dem fotografieren beginnt ist es wundersch n
9316069 ja es ist so ich bin gelangweilt von der fotografie und das darf ich auch es ist okay

9316072 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9316073 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9316074 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9316075 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9316076 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9316077 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9316078 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9316079 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9316080 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9316081 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9316082 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9316083 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9316084 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9316085 no one works for someone we all just work together
9316086 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9316087 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9316088 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9316089 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9316090 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9316091 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9316092 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9316093 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9316094 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9316095 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9316096 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9316097 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9316098 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9316099 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9316100 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9316101 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9316102 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9316103 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9316104 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9316105 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9316106 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9316107 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9316108 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9316109 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9316110 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9316111 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9316112 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9316113 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9316114 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9316115 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9316116 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9316117 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9316118 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9316119 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9316120 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9316121 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9316122 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9316123 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9316124 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9316125 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9316126 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9316127 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9316128 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9316129 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9316130 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9316131 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9316132 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9316133 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9316134 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9316135 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9316136 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9316137 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9316138 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9316139 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9316140 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9316141 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9316142 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9316143 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9316144 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9316145 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9316146 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9316147 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9316148 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9316149 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9316150 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9316151 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9316152 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9316153 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9316154 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9316155 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9316156 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9316157 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9316158 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9316159 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9316160 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9316161 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9316162 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9316163 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9316164 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9316165 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9316166 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9316167 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9316168 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9316169 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9316170 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9316171 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9316172 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9316173 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9316174 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9316175 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9316176 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9316177 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9316178 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9316179 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9316180 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9316181 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9316182 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9316183 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9316184 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9316185 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9316186 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9316187 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9316188 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9316189 fra lagen skulle f r bara ett rtionde sedan ha betraktas som en om jlighet n gonting taget ur en sovjetstat eller en dystopisk framtidsskildring

9316191 every year about 1 5 lakh students go abroad for higher studies if we have a strong educational infrastructure within the country we can save such a big amount being spent abroad
9316192 today the scenario is so bad that teachers are appointed on contract basis and those who teach students of middle standard are barely matriculates such teachers are hired for remuneration as low as rs 1500 2500 per month
9316193 this can only be done by increasing more universities and more universities in turn means further shortage of teachers
9316194 this gives us a platform to take off to the developed nation status as far as engineering education is concerned
9316195 einer der gr ten fehler den sie in ihrem leben machen k nnen
9316196 neighbors have complained they cannot live in peace harmony or good physical and mental health because noisy dogs disturb the peace

9316200 die sozialdemokraten m ssen sich jetzt entscheiden entweder sie wollen mit den kommunisten an die macht oder sie bek mpfen die linke mal so mal so das geht nicht
9316201 on the 8th june 2008 my wife and i travelled to mexico and stayed in the name of hotel in playacar on the day after our arrival my wife slipped on a tiled floor and broke her wrist in four places as she made her way to shelter from a small rain storm that had been frequent to the area so we were told by other guests staying there we feel that the hotel could have done more to prevent this from happening as the tiles when wet were absolutely lethal also we noted these same tiles in the foyer had anti slip mats but unfortunately they had not placed them anywhere else we did contact compensation claims helpline who informed us that because it happened in mexico it was not worth pursuing we feel that the because the name of hotel and major tour operator are all connected and a european company they should be held accountable unfortunately we cannot find there address to write to them and complain and ask for compensation
9316202 again poor regard to risk has led this familys holiday being ruined for want of proper assessment what is also concerning is the fact that other organisations are clearly offering legal advices that are incorrect the british travel consumer in fact all european travel consumers must be offered a greater protection in holiday contracts with a clear and unambiguous definition of a safety standard and obligations
9316203 employers have had to put a hold on recruitment as the credit crunch bites
9316204 employers have had to put a hold on recruitment as the credit crunch bites it is understandable that businesses want to be in good shape coming out of this economic uncertainty and so redundancy just cannot be ruled out
9316205 employers must ensure they approach redundancy in a sensitive way and ensure they follow legal regulations to avoid ending up in court bosses must also keep their employees in the loop with what is going on
9316206 obviously there will be many worried workers so employers should make it clear to their workers what their intentions are

9316212 dan barang siapa alloh menghendaki untuk diberikannya hidayah maka dia lapangkan dada orang itu untuk atau karena islam dan barang siapa alloh menghendakinya sesat maka dia jadikan dada orang itu sempit dan sesak seolah olah naik ke langit

9316219 dan sesungguhnya kamu datang kepada kami sendiri sendiri sebagaimana kamu kami ciptakan pada mulanya dan kamu tinggalkan di belakangmu di dunia apa yang telah kami karuniakan kepadamu dan kami tiada melihat besertamu pemberi syafaat yang kamu anggap bahwa mereka itu sekutu sekutu tuhan diantara kamu
9316220 maka berilah peringatan karena sesugguhnya kamu hanyalah orang yang memberi peringatan kamu bukanlah orang yang berkuasa atas mereka
9316221 dan jikalau tuhanmu menghendaki tentulah beriman semua orang di muka bumi seluruhnya
9316222 tidak ada paksaan untuk memasuki agama islam sesungguhnya telah jelas jalan yang benar dari jalan yang sesat karena itu barangsiapa yang ingkar kepada taghut dan beriman kepada allah maka sesungguhnya ia berpegang pada buhul tali yang amat kuat yang tidak akan putus dan allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
9316223 the distinguishing characteristic of this group is the absolutist and uncompromising nature of its beliefs in many ways this orientation tends to be purist in the sense that it is intolerant of competing points of view and considers pluralist realities to be a form of contamination of the unadultered truth

9316240 thousands of churches have been targeted by gangs over the past year with more than 1 million worth of metal stolen every month the thieves strip lead from the roofs which they can sell to scrap dealers cashing in on high metal prices many churches have been targeted repeatedly and now want to stop replacing the stolen lead and start using cheaper alternatives like stainless steel felt or tiles which would be less tempting to thieves

9316310 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
9316311 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience

9316314 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea

9316324 as always we try to keep the best 53 football players
9316325 i like this squad a lot number one we have talented players number two i believe theyre focused and still hungry with something to prove
9316326 when you look into the eyes of the players you see three or four different reactions on the one hand there will be the guy who had no idea he was going to be released and hes in a state of shock another is the guy who desperately wanted to make the team and probably did a pretty good job of camouflaging it a lot of times but now theres no camouflage whatsoever hes devastated then there are the eyes of the individual who kind of knew it was coming is very gracious about it and wants to thank everybody for the opportunity that hes had then there are the young guys who you can encourage and perhaps offer a practice squad position to those guys seem to come back off the floor once they know that there is going to be a practice squad opportunity for them should they clear waivers
9316327 you have a lot of emotions and you have a lot of people that are anxious about this day
9316328 you have some guys that come to the building here and it hasnt sunk in why theyre here so when they come up to you theyre in a state of shock its an anxious day for the player and its not a happy day for all of us here because youve had so many people that have played and tried so hard and theyre not going to be a part of our team thats the unfortunate nature of the process
9316329 because every group of young men is a new group
9316330 you become attached to them you find out what theyre made of you watch them practice and play and recognize the effort they give no two circumstances are ever the same with regard to releasing the players
9316331 obviously its a calculated risk we studied all the numbers theres a 90 percent assurance you never get beyond the one backup quarterback the thing about it is with our kicker situation at this point in time we felt like we needed to be able to protect some players and still be able to do the things necessary from the standpoint of placekickers
9316332 theyre veteran players and theyve seen an awful lot in this game and theyve been able to react to it each individual is different from the standpoint of reuben we have a pretty good group of guys at running back and felt like they were all worthy of making an nfl team and they have so many roles that they can play reuben can be a fullback he can be a running back he can be a special teams player he can be a short yardage and goal line guy he has a lot of hats he can wear
9316333 i think most of the time if you go back and look the roster turnover is in that area
9316334 there is always change in some way shape or form the other thing is youre always in a position where youre trying to develop your young guys to come along thats always a factor youre counting on the veteran experience from the offensive side of the ball and hoping the new guys can become integrated as fast as possible to the sophistication to the in season play you just hope people can come together as fast as possible to make the kind of plays that are necessary to win
9316335 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9316336 thats really the number one thing john carney has so much experience and been in this league for so long kicked so many game winning field goals and been in so many tight situations its very difficult to overlook that part of it especially when youre week to week with your present kicker a guy thats kicked a 47 yarder to put you in the super bowl
9316337 ive been training and i feel good i feel strong and healthy im motivated to continue my career i felt good about the way things worked out last year when i filled in for an injured kicker down in jacksonville then i finished the season with kansas city and things worked out well i felt confident if i continued to train and hope i would get some more opportunities here in 2008
9316338 this is a phenomenal team that had a remarkable season last year
9316339 i was very proud to see the giants pull off the amazing victory in the super bowl and i feel honored and blessed to be here with the team right now
9316340 we really just wanted to make another list to show you how much we hate bush
9316341 after extensive news coverage about all this nasty behind the scenes scandal troopergate which is definitely not squeaky clean palins approval ratings fell to 67 still high but a far cry from the 90 number thats being thrown around so glibly by the republicans today alaskans are quickly becoming disillusioned once again
9316342 until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here

9316347 we dont need to worry about global warming we dont need to save the earth jesus already did that

9316383 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri and then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i was upset about
9316384 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9316385 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9316386 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9316387 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9316388 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede
9316389 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9316390 and i am also scared to spend a lot of money after listening to

9316431 mccain has strong ideas on how to change our government i think he would do much more than sen barack obama
9316432 we think its important to vote for people it gives a chance for young kids to vote
9316433 i wish i could if i could i definitely would i think its one of the more important things we can do i wish more kids would vote
9316434 i like his economic policies for the most part even though i find he is a little more liberal than i like i feel he has more experience than obama

9316448 the vast majority of our teachers are doing an excellent job
9316449 as i go round the country heads tell me how difficult it is to get rid of weak teachers
9316450 they say they start the procedure and they might be 18 months down the line and the teacher will move we need to be thinking of ways of preventing that
9316451 that isnt ofsteds role but i sympathise with head teachers about that
9316452 the childrens plan we published last december set out proposals to improve the performance of teachers who have the greatest difficulty in carrying out their role effectively including a proposal to help underperforming teachers leave the profession if that is appropriate and removing their qualified teacher status

9316463 im not sure i can even be bothered to explain this today was south africas day they were desperate and uninhibited
9316464 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9316465 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us

9316480 iran certainly thinks it has a deal and the israelis believe that a deal has been reached but that they can still block it
9316481 if tehran obtained the s 300 it would be a game changer in military thinking for tackling iran that could be a catalyst for israeli air attacks before its operational
9316482 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9316483 kill him kill kill you have to kill him you understand
9316484 make themselves like a man a woman like a man the punishment is kill kill them throw them from the highest place
9316485 this is not to tell you to start killing people
9316486 there must be a muslim leader when the muslim army becomes stronger when islam has grown enough
9316487 islam is keeping away from disbelief and from the disbelievers the people who disbelieve
9316488 its part of islam of the correct belief that you love those who love allah and that you hate those who hate allah
9316489 it is not befitting for muslims that he should reside in the land of evil the land of the kuffaar the land of the disbelievers
9316490 some conditions can take you into disbelief to take the british citizenship whether you like it or not for these people you are selling your religion its a very serious thing it is not allowed to give allegiance to other than allah
9316491 what are these people doing in there these things are so vile what they say with their tongues is so vile and disgusting its an abomination
9316492 this is false it does not work this concept is a lie it is fake and it is a farce
9316493 sister if me and my husband we cant go together what do i do if i want to go
9316494 you know that working in an environment that is not islamic working with the kuffaar all this takes you away from the religion and hardens your heart and it would be lying to you if i say its ok
9316495 you see muslims in every sphere of everyday life in this country i see muslims it breaks my heart when i see them working in banks short sleeves tight scarf like this make up being with the kuffaar all the time even speaking their language
9316496 the icc the london central mosque and islamic cultural centre most commonly referred to as the regents park mosque is committed to interfaith and cross cultural understanding
9316497 it does not support or condone extreme views racial hatred violence or intolerance
9316498 whilst it is recommended for a muslim to migrate to a muslim country it is not obligatory
9316499 we are not blind followers of any government or any clerics we do criticise other religions just as other religions criticise islam we encourage integration into society
9316500 you may regard these juristic and textual rulings as extreme restrictions
9316501 but we see them as our way of life and a liberation of the soul
9316502 evil wicked mischievous people they do the most evil filthy things
9316503 their time will come like every other evil persons time will come
9316504 then people can see people without hands people can see in public heads rolling down the street people got sic their hands and feet from opposite sides chopped off and they see them crucified they see people put up against the pole and see them get lashed in public they see it and because they see it it acts as a deterrent for them because they say i dont want that to happen to me
9316505 the lecture was aimed at reforming the muslim people the muslim society and the muslim world to be adjudicated by the sovereign islamic state
9316506 we try to represent a variety of opinions through the products we sell in order to spread peace respect tolerance and understanding
9316507 despite having no control over the bookshop we met with those running the bookshop after your programme was broadcast we made it clear that it was not acceptable for the bookshop to stock materials containing extremist views we were assured all offending material had been removed
9316508 petrodollar money coming from saudi arabia has basically distorted the growth and development of the muslim community in britain
9316509 the abuse and misuse of this great faith of mine
9316510 the underlying motive here is to find a way of continuously implanting this permanent wedge between the wider british society and the younger muslims living in britain
9316511 to think as i believe our government thinks that it makes ideological sense to play patsy with the saudi government is folly of the first order of magnitude we will be paying for it for years to come
9316512 we took over 3 500 terrorists off the streets of baghdad in around 18 months
9316513 you could say it was a very successful period but the butchers bill was high the attrition rate is equivalent to that experienced by the sas during the malayan insurgency 50 years ago
9316514 the relationship between the sas and delta force is very close
9316515 if anything the attrition rate in delta force is higher two years ago the sas made a donation to delta forces widows and orphans fund of 10 000
9316516 there is no shoot to kill policy in iraq but there are only a few ways of stopping a suicide bomber a british lawyer is present during the planning stages of every operation and our troops operate under british rules not american rules
9316517 they have helped immensely in baghdad they have done a phenomenal job
9316518 they have exceptional initiative exceptional skill exceptional courage and i think exceptional savvy i cant say enough about how impressive they are in thinking on their feet
9316519 most of the soldiers who had served in either the gulf or afghanistan were suffering from post traumatic stress little support or counselling was available on discharge from the forces
9316520 virtually all became involved in heavy drinking or drug taking and in consequence involvement in violence offences sometimes domestically related happened routinely
9316521 the vast majority of the offending is drug or alcohol related violence there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling
9316522 had support services been available at the point of discharge and when personnel first came in touch with the criminal justice system custody could have been avoided probably in the majority of cases
9316523 a select few get into a vortex that drags them downwards
9316524 we believe more effort should be made to tackle the acceptance of heavy drinking that still occurs among sections of the armed forces to identify causes for alcohol misuse to help vulnerable personnel reduce their alcohol intake and to investigate the long term psychological health effects of alcohol over use among service personnel
9316525 the majority of people that leave the armed forces leave having had a life changing experience
9316526 some do find it difficult to adjust and feel isolated and lonely in some cases people will descend into alcohol or substance abuse lose their job and spiral into homelessness and eventually end up in jail military operations in recent years have placed the armed forces under increased pressures
9316527 robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd and other stress disorders counselling is available to service personnel at all times and all troops receive pre and post deployment briefings to help recognise the signs of stress disorders
9316528 thats when i started to drink heavily everybody did it it was the norm
9316529 it took me a long time to realise i was suffering from ptsd and now i look back at the way that i used to be violent in the past and i really regret it
9316530 i have a wife and kid now and a steady job so its difficult to understand just why i was doing it
9316531 you see vehicles destroyed by rockets on the side of the road
9316532 the wreckage isnt there for long the army soon removes it to make it look as if they are still in control of the road but they are on the verge of losing it
9316533 if there is a more dangerous job in pakistan i would like to know what it is
9316534 if nato lost control of the pass there is no doubt that other routes would be found
9316535 but they are more difficult and expensive it would interfere with the smooth running of the operation
9316536 there is certainly some enemy action on this supply route
9316537 but it has no impact on our mission in afghanistan
9316538 you used to see a lot of oil tankers that were damaged but the chassis and the engine were fine
9316539 the government is aware of these attacks on convoys in the khyber region and it is one of the reasons why we have had a major military operation there in the past few weeks
9316540 but realized that some people might be limited by budget i decided to leave the discussion going in that thread but would like to open it up to paid marketing only
9316541 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9316542 they said we took their jobs but i was working from 6 a m to 8 p m
9316543 they need to go and do this in every little town
9316544 and it seems like they have just arrived and are getting the nice cars and the good homes
9316545 placed all the burdens of a broken system onto immigrant families
9316546 former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9316547 in picking an unknown untested half a term governor from alaska john mccain is following in a long line of reckless men who have rolled the dice for a beauty queen
9316548 just wait until she is debating joe biden and he starts attacking or condescending to her
9316549 it wont help with most hillary voters but it could help with some
9316550 if you are so concerned about the amount of experience of the vice president what about the top of your ticket
9316551 sometimes i wish i were a little kid again skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts
9316552 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9316553 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9316554 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable
9316555 its one for pedestrians and people and humans and bumble bees
9316556 we have some evidence that the three traits are really the same thing and may represent a successful evolutionary strategy
9316557 i woke up and my email was just going crazy
9316558 and then when it was announced it was like you couldnt breathe
9316559 its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9316560 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9316561 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9316562 there is an electricity going through the social conservative crowd right now its unbelievable
9316563 especially given all the set ups and head fakes its amazing a lot of people were sure he was going to show his more moderate colors
9316564 my wife knew nothing about this woman but she was in tears listening to her articulate the views she had
9316565 dozens of emails and the phones have been ringing off the hook
9316566 they were taunting me saying mccains going to disappoint you
9316567 boy what kind of prayers have you been saying for mccain
9316568 he went and chose a pentecostal for his running mate
9316569 finally we can get 100 behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9316570 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of as his running mate
9316571 while wants to ban ar 15s palin shoots ar 15s and apparently pretty well
9316572 every shooter every hunter every gun owner every competitor needs to understand that it is time to in the words of bruce willis cowboy the f
9316573 well be able to have some fun contrasting not just mccain and obama but biden and palin
9316574 shes great on our issues and bidens been terrible for 35 years
9316575 palin could play strong in the sporting states like michigan ohio and pennsylvania depending on how they use her
9316576 most pundits will underestimate her appeal in these key areas because they dont know her and they are unfamiliar with the sporting scene but among sportsmen authenticity counts and palins got that and then some
9316577 i can tell you that this pick tells millions in the base of the party that they can trust mccain more specifically that they can trust him with supreme court picks and other key appoitments
9316578 ive talked to two prominent social conservative leaders in the past 24 hours who told me they had previously not planned to attend the convention but were now coming to minneapolis after the palin pick
9316579 one scrambled to find a hotel room and is coming tomorrow the other re arranged his schedule and is flying in wednesday i got a call this afternoon from an evangelical business leader who told me he was contacting the mccain campaign and offering to host a fundraiser with his friends for mccain sans the candidate before the thursday deadline when mccain shifts to the public financing system i dont know if ive ever seen a veep pick energize the grassroots like this
9316580 contrast that to obamas bitter clingers obama just lost blue collar white democratic voters in pennsylvania and other states
9316581 the choice is to shore up the conservative pro drilling base
9316582 this is an aggressive on offense pick not a defensive pick
9316583 he floated the pro abortion running mate then there was his performance at the saddleback debate and then you had the lieberman headfake and now this

9316590 while we believe we are seeing a downward curve in the number of people who have become ill we still have many challenges with some patients who remain hospitalized
9316591 we continue to ask the public to be extra diligent in their hand washing and food preparation to minimize the possibility of additional persons becoming ill

9316640 i got to the airport and i just couldnt carry on it was definitely a no no in county cricket you know its matter of getting into a car to get home if i was playing a game today here i am confident that i could play but i cant sustain it on winter tours
9316641 to get tres back in the team would be massive
9316642 it would be great i just feel sorry for the county bowlers who he is smashing at the moment but he is a man on his own and hes got his reasons hes made his decision and thats it
9316643 if developers try to raise finance from banks on their own they would normally incur a borrowing cost of around 14 15 whereas a construction company would be able to raise funding at lower rates depending on various factors
9316644 we are in talks with various national and international construction companies for a number of projects since we have a non disclosure agreement with them i can not name the projects or companies it will help us to focus better on construction of the projects and also their marketing
9316645 it helps in saving cost and also in timely delivery

9316648 museums governing committee decided by a clear majority to keep it on display
9316649 not art but a blasphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that offends many people
9316650 the controversy has been exploited by politicians including mr pahl for electoral reasons its true the pressure was heavy but we are an autonomous museum and we have taken our decision the work aroused a lot of argument among visitors many liked it and many disliked it but the public row was merely political and it has gone on long enough
9316651 the key factor is that our manager dave jones wants to keep this squad together and believes we will challenge for promotion
9316652 the board decision was to back the manager 100 per cent our stance on offers for key players remains unchanged none of them will be sold at any price
9316653 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
9316654 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
9316655 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
9316656 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
9316657 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
9316658 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
9316659 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
9316660 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
9316661 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
9316662 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
9316663 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
9316664 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
9316665 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
9316666 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
9316667 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
9316668 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
9316669 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
9316670 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
9316671 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
9316672 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
9316673 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
9316674 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
9316675 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
9316676 we have no chance at all so lets do something that will make us seem accepting of women
9316677 weve heightened our surveillance to try and identify any new cases that occur
9316678 even though the product has now been pulled off the shelves of all the stores and weve gone to great lengths to have all the health inspectors across the province follow up on particularly the high risk institutions to ensure those meat products are not used there we may have another case or two in the next few weeks
9316679 basically these cases were looking at that are linked to the national outbreak they both had some underlying health issues
9316680 by and large if youre a healthy adult you dont need to worry
9316681 i am anxious to get back to calgary and play those guys in their stadium i cant wait
9316682 it extends itself beyond the defensive line the linebackers are kicking in
9316683 we are going to have to be very good if we want to win the battle of the line of scrimmage

9316691 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling
9316692 that was the best political speech i have ever seen delivered by an american woman politician palin is as tough as nails
9316693 good lord we had barely 12 hours of democrat optimism
9316694 it was a stunningly timed piece of pr by the republicans
9316695 well get a taste in the next five days of how well she does in the 62 days that follow
9316696 seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9316697 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9316698 i was raised in a family where gender was not going to be an issue
9316699 the girls did what the boys did apparently in alaska thats quite commonplace
9316700 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9316701 i cant claim a bill clinton and say i never inhaled
9316702 it has really opened my eyes to international events and how war impacts everyday americans like us
9316703 we had a bad fishing year so we didnt have any money
9316704 my husband loves being a dad as much as i love being a mom

9316706 i just put down the blackberrys and pick up the breast pump
9316707 having had two children at home at the age of four months i know how much help they need even without unfortunate medical conditions
9316708 i really feel mother knows best without the peanut gallery giving unsolicited advice she strongly conveys to women today that you dont have to choose between a successful career and motherhood you do have to make sacrifices but you can have it all
9316709 i would just trust that the child is not neglected in any way there are millions of women who work why is it that the father cannot provide the same standard of care there has been an evolving view of working women even in conservative christian circles
9316710 i didnt think the republicans would pick a female candidate for another decade but john mccain is not a typical conservative leader
9316711 i am offended by mccains choice of palin none of the above qualifies me for vp nor palin it is a cynical insult to the political judgment of american women so says kris branamann of snellville ga usa

9316724 on a broader level when you look at the different people in fleetwood mac the key thing right now for us is to dignify how we got started and the road we have left to go to make sure that its done in a way which is fundamentally supportive of each other and acknowledging of the love we have for each other now

9316925 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9316926 i am very happy to come here and play in the premier league playing in england has been a lifelong dream which has finally come true by moving to city
9316927 id met hughes previously and was really impressed with him but having talked to him about manchester city i had to come here and be part of his plans im very confident of helping the first team to achieve their goals for the season and after walking around the stadium i cant wait to play in front of the city fans there it is very impressive
9316928 this is a fantastic moment for me but it makes me think i am getting old
9316929 i still love racing though and have as much desire as i did when i started i used to look at 30 year old guys when i began at gps and think wow thats old but now i guess the young guys look at me and think that
9316930 i really want to thank everyone who has helped me in my career and it is great that i have broken this record with suzuki because working with them is just fantastic i now plan to go on to make 300 appearances win more races and get more podiums
9316931 there have been plenty of highs and lows in my career and its been an honour to wear the springbok jersey
9316932 but it is time to go this has been coming for quite a while with the new laws and a new era in front of us and with a new coach peter de villiers it is the right time
9316933 i want to thank the selectors for recalling me to the side after the world cup last year they gave me the opportunity to come back to south africa and play eight more tests and get to the 100 mark
9316934 my son normally opens the shop at 7am our customers come in by 7 30am
9316935 faizal said the locks were glued and he could not open them we had to cut the locks open with a bolt cutter
9316936 we had a look at the security surveillance camera and saw a businessman fred carter who operates a hardware store next door to my business gluing the locks
9316937 it was around 7pm and carters face was clearly visible in the video we handed the video to the police
9316938 we dont even have a fence between our shops i thought we could trust each other
9316939 on the friday when carter was brought in by the police he pleaded with me to drop the charges but i refused
9316940 two weeks ago we opened the store to find a pool of blood on the floor
9316941 we checked where the blood had come from and found a pigs head on the roof
9316942 if carter has a problem he should come and talk to me about it
9316943 on august 9 the door to my store was jammed my staff had to break it open to enter
9316944 i was so frustrated with this incident i assumed habib did it this drove me to do what i did
9316945 i am ashamed of it but i still consider habib a good neighbour
9316946 how many people in this police station were arrested by the scorpions
9316947 the scorpions said they would be ready to prosecute in february 2008 now it is august
9316948 you grew up here so its not spectacular to you its just normal
9316949 yeah and have you ever noticed where its beautiful theres a lot of pretty but not a lot of jobs unless you worked for the university

9316967 es para nosotros una gran responsabilidad que este primer equipo se sienta como en casa todas las infraestructuras necesarias para que su estancia en alicante sea la adecuada est n a punto desde hace m s de un mes
9316968 a lo largo de la semana pasada se instal la base del equipo en la zona t cnica designada al efecto y todas las conexiones de luz agua y telecomunicaciones est n en funcionamiento
9316969 es algo que est aprobado por ley y ser a inconstitucional que el estatuto de castilla la mancha lo cuestionara o le pusiera una caducidad
9316970 mucho tiempo advirtiendo sobre la inconstitucionalidad del estatuto en este aspecto
9316971 fundamental que todo el mundo aplique el sentido com n
9316972 quien deber a ser el primero en hacer cumplir con esa constitucionalidad es el gobierno de espa a
9316973 lleve a cabo una pol tica hidr ulica rigurosa y seria y que no impulse esa pol tica de saltos que hace que cada estatuto vaya en una direcci n distinta
9316974 la necesidad de un pacto de estado sobre el agua
9316975 seguir apoyando a los regantes y agricultores de alicante y de toda la comunitat velando para que el estatuto de castilla la mancha no se apruebe con las condiciones previstas
9316976 deben pasar de su calculada ambig edad a decir de forma alta y clara si apoyar n este trasvase en el congreso de los diputados y defender n los intereses de los alicantinos tal y como ya ha anunciado el psoe
9316977 tienen ahora una gran oportunidad de demostrar que su guerra del agua no era solamente un enga o electoral a todos los valencianos
9316978 el trasvase es absolutamente necesario para la provincia de alicante y es econ micamente viable en sus normas de explotaci n
9316979 existe un caudal m nimo de seguridad en los pantanos de entrepinos y buend a de donde se toma el agua fijado en m s de 400 hect metros c bicos cantidad por debajo de la cual no pueden realizarse desembalses
9316980 nunca el tajo segura ha trasvasado ni la quinta parte de agua para la que fue dise ado
9316981 como pretende castilla la mancha ser a un absurdo ya que por intentar poner la venda antes que la herida se producir a un enorme da o en la econom a valenciana
9316982 por eso los socialistas valencianos siempre hemos luchado por la continuidad del mismo y lo seguiremos haciendo hasta el ltimo minuto apoyando la postura de nuestro grupo parlamentario en madrid

9316984 in maggio mio padre e il mio procuratore si sono visti non meno di tre volte con i dirigenti del real madrid per rinnovare il mio contratto il club per pensava di prendere cristiano ronaldo e non ha mostrato alcun interesse reale di tenermi qui tre volte siamo venuti e tre volte ci hanno detto di tornare a settembre io non ho nulla contro cristiano ronaldo ma non un problema mio se non sono riusciti a prenderlo erano sicuri e questo ha fatto s che linteresse per me diminuisse anche io ho un mio orgoglio
9316985 voglio il chelsea e lho gi detto a tutti al presidente a mijatovic allallenatore per dato che non sono riusciti a prendere nessuno non mi lasciano andare via non minteressa io voglio giocare nel chelsea non so fino a dove potr arrivare vedremo
9316986 lallenatore ha detto che la mia testa cambiata in questi ultimi giorni ma non cos io ho le idee chiare da tempo e so quello che faccio se lui vuole tenere un giocatore controvoglia beh si assumer la responsabilit schuster non mio padre il tecnico aveva usato questo termine nella conferenza stampa di ieri riferendosi a robinho come a un figlio che non vuole ascoltare ndr lui lallenatore io un giocatore e basta e poi lui fa il suo gioco ha i suoi obiettivi altro che padre il chelsea ha fatto il massimo sforzo e io ho gi laccordo con calderon e con mijatovic ma siccome non hanno preso nessuno ora il mister non vuole farmi andar via dice che vuole recuperarmi ma non c niente da recuperare del resto calderon gi in maggio mi disse che se avessi portato un club con una buona offerta mi avrebbe fatto andar via io ho fatto la mia parte ma siamo arrivati allultimo giorno il madrid non riuscito a comprare nessuno e ora hanno cambiato idea e questo per colpa di schuster lunico che non vuole che me ne vada
9316987 io posso anche non giocare per un anno sono giovane ho 24 anni recuperer senza problemi comunque non rifiuter di giocare col real madrid con i compagni non ho problemi e se dovessi fermarmi qui non avr problemi nemmeno con il pubblico se mi fischieranno o minsulteranno abbasser la testa e far il mio mestiere
9316988 quando arrivai qui pensavo di restare per 10 anni ma non stato possibile ora voglio andare al chelsea
9316989 undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that john howard is gone
9316990 i hope he doesnt its obviously up to him ultimately to decide what he will do but i hope he doesnt leave the parliament and i hope hes available for higher duties
9316991 my interest is in having the best possible team for the liberal party to contest the next election and plainly peter costello is a very superior political talent and id like him to be part of that team
9316992 so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve which so clearly if understandably wavered in the aftermath of the last election
9316993 only peter costello can decide whether to carry the tag of greatest prime minister australia never had
9316994 i think brendan nelson is doing a terrific job under difficult circumstances
9316995 the question marks that are now very much hanging over the rudd government are due in large measure to brendan nelsons tenacity and political savvy
9316996 last year when peter had an opportunity to take the leadership of the liberal party he declined and said he would be retiring from politics
9316997 brendan put his hand up and was elected the leader of the party
9316998 now tony can write tribute pieces to peter costello and i think thats entirely appropriate but the reality is peter said he didnt want to stand for leader
9316999 i would relish the opportunity each and every day and im sure the treasurer wayne swan would relish it too to remind people of the high inflation high interest rate legacy he left this country when he left the office of treasurer last november
9317000 at the town meeting two new roads that serve as highways in new residential subdivisions in west woodstock were approved for the town to service those roads were aplin hill lane and tayler trail doug porter from wba was present earlier in the meeting to describe the necessity of the new development and the new tax dollars those homes will be bringing to the town
9317001 behind them is a much broader group that may disown their tactics but appreciate the sentiment and the result why
9317002 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9317003 the bottom line is that what katrina and rita didnt destroy in 2005 this storm has the potential to do
9317004 were going to be each day seeing what happens were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9317005 i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9317006 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9317007 since becoming alaskas first female governor in 2006 governor palin has made her mark as the strongest pro life pro family governor in alaska to date
9317008 her blessing was born in april with down syndrome mccain needs to re energise the evangelical base which turned out in force to put george bush into office twice
9317009 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9317010 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9317011 but whether it is a category 4 or 5 it is extremely dangerous either way
9317012 flooding that is worse than what we saw with katrina
9317013 this storm could be as bad as it gets when it comes to the effect on the louisiana coast
9317014 tuesdays cut of 25 per cent will make lending cheaper than a week ago but not cheaper than a year ago
9317015 but the cost of their funds has now eased and also there has been an increase in political and public pressure on them to cut their rates
9317016 i think that on top of tomorrows cut there will be a further cut in october november three next year and two more in 2010 provided inflation is on the decline
9317017 unfortunately at this stage we have not been able to identify those people however we are reviewing cctv and reviewing a number of other avenues of inquiry
9317018 theres a suggestion that the party was organised through internet and through sms and we will be pursuing that
9317019 no items in the infrastructure strategy are dependent upon the governments electricity plans

9317021 even in the third quarter there and the last quarter the boys were endeavouring and they were trying things
9317022 they were trying to generate run and movement and we just couldnt get any flow whatsoever we couldnt make anything work for us today
9317023 we were completely outpointed st kilda fixed up adelaide good and proper last week and adelaide have shown their formline was pretty good so we were playing a side that was in pretty good nick
9317024 every player that represented our club today had that best intention to give them a good send off it just didnt pan out like that we didnt play well enough
9317025 i know theres a lot of emotional players in the rooms afterwards that really do admire the four boys that are retiring
9317026 the performance wasnt good but the four guys that played today that are retiring have done themselves proud and been wonderful people for the essendon footy club and thats what its about
9317027 we knew it was a mathematical possibility but i certainly dont get up and bounce out of my house and think lets win by 100 points
9317028 i come to afl games knowing that if you dont compete hard and dont chase and tackle you get embarrassed very quickly so to be frank that was the furtherest thing from my mind until it became a mathematical possibility
9317029 but i can understand everyone being excited when almost an impossibility becomes real everyone gets excited

9317179 going to museums viewing architecture it was part of what you did
9317180 i traveled with him viewing art it was the value judgment of art that caught me at first going to a museum or gallery that judgments already been made by someone else for me thats where irwin came in he says you have the eye and thats what it takes to trust yourself thats what i tell collectors now develop your visual vocabulary trust yourself
9317181 it was very poorly defined the idea of a non profit gallery
9317182 but they were there to support artists and thats where i find them

9317186 thats the thing to look for talent and drive thats what makes the former come to fruition

9317231 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dellangelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9317232 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti

9317262 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9317263 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9317264 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9317265 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9317266 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9317267 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9317268 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9317269 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9317270 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9317271 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9317272 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9317273 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9317274 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9317275 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9317276 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9317277 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9317278 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9317279 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9317280 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9317281 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9317282 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9317283 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9317284 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9317285 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9317286 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9317287 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9317288 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9317289 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9317290 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9317291 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9317292 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9317293 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9317294 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9317295 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9317296 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9317297 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9317298 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9317299 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9317300 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9317301 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9317302 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9317303 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9317304 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9317305 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9317306 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9317307 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9317308 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9317309 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9317310 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9317311 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9317312 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9317313 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9317314 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9317315 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9317316 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9317317 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9317318 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9317319 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9317320 some games you can hit your head as many as five times
9317321 usually you hit your head get a headache and once the headache is gone you go back
9317322 it helped me realize the extent of damage that was done
9317323 this is an important piece of the assessment process for determining when a player is ready to return to play
9317324 it will help reduce the number of injuries because if we return a player too early research shows theyre at a three times greater risk of receiving another concussion
9317325 this new tool will likely result in players sitting out for longer so they can fully recover which in the long run is a good thing
9317326 spurred a growing interest in home health strategies that can help curb costs by minimizing office visits and hospitalizations and may lead to better patient outcomes
9317327 gaining a foothold in the increasingly costly health care market
9317328 treat a wide array of patients from those suffering from congestive heart failure and diabetes to mental health patients and complex maternity cases
9317329 its getting a lot of attention now in mainstream health care to help cut down on costs
9317330 its been very successful when its done well in reducing the hospitalization of patients because you can reach something early
9317331 questions remain among some health care providers about who will be paid for which services

9317334 we are delighted that nice have confirmed final guidance for amd wet amd is a debilitating eye condition that can result in a rapid loss of sight if left untreated lucentis is a treatment for a key unmet medical need and it has the potential to save many peoples sight
9317335 the ranibizumab reimbursement scheme is an innovative approach which shows how pharmaceutical companies can work together with nice and the dh to ensure patients do get access to treatments on the nhs rapid implementation of the guidance is now needed to ensure that patients receive the treatment they need as soon as possible
9317336 we are extremely pleased that nice has confirmed final guidance and hope that it is implemented without delay the guidance including the roll out of the ranibizumab reimbursement scheme will provide improved patient access to lucentis
9317337 i found the course very useful it was both interesting and stimulating and attending has made me more confident about preparing medico legal reports i would recommend that anybody looking to get involved in any aspect of medico legal work signs up the course has something to offer any expert irrespective of their level of experience
9317338 feedback from delegates is always extremely positive there is widespread agreement amongst gps and specialists that the importance of completing medical reports to a high standard is paramount and knowing how to do so effectively as well as give evidence in court is important for gps and specialists in their busy and often hectic lives
9317339 i found this one day course relevant focused and well planned the leader made us all comfortable and encouraged an environment where we were all able to exchange experiences and tips the talks were set at the right level and everyone felt involved and the group tasks were not only great fun but instructive too
9317340 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defense
9317341 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula
9317342 ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
9317343 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
9317344 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood
9317345 biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
9317346 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
9317347 the current water levels are entirely the result of the meteorological and hydrological conditions and were not caused by water release from presently operating chinese dams which have storage areas far too small to affect the flood hydrology of the mekong
9317348 when kidneys are healthy very little or no protein appears in the urine
9317349 protein in the urine is an early sign that the kidneys filters have been damaged by disease allowing protein to leak into the urine
9317350 proteinuria is a strong risk factor for kidney failure and by decreasing proteinuria pentoxifylline may help in reducing the likelihood that a diabetic patient will end up needing dialysis
9317351 a positive finding in this context would be of profound significance because it would provide a novel and inexpensive therapy for the growing global epidemic of diabetic nephropathy

9317356 the democrats will attempt to project the issue as whether a woman can be vice president a point the republicans can cheerfully concede returning to the question of whether this woman in particular should be the vice president mrs ferraro is manifestly an affirmative action nominee she has been in the house only since 1979 and cannot be said on the record to be as qualified to be president if necessary as say john glenn fritz hollings mo udall or george bush
9317357 i believe that someday we are going to have a woman president possibly during my life and ive often thought the best way to pave the way for this was to first nominate and elect a woman as vice president but i think mondale made a serious mistake when he picked geraldine ferraro as his running mate in my view he guessed wrong in deciding to take a congresswoman that almost nobody had ever heard of and try to put her in line for the presidency i dont know who among the democrats might have been a better choice but it was obvious mondale picked geraldine ferraro simply because he believed there was a gender gap where i was concerned and she was a woman

9317373 even in the third quarter there and the last quarter the boys were endeavouring and they were trying things
9317374 they were trying to generate run and movement and we just couldnt get any flow whatsoever we couldnt make anything work for us today
9317375 we were completely outpointed st kilda fixed up adelaide good and proper last week and adelaide have shown their formline was pretty good so we were playing a side that was in pretty good nick
9317376 every player that represented our club today had that best intention to give them a good send off it just didnt pan out like that we didnt play well enough
9317377 i know theres a lot of emotional players in the rooms afterwards that really do admire the four boys that are retiring
9317378 the performance wasnt good but the four guys that played today that are retiring have done themselves proud and been wonderful people for the essendon footy club and thats what its about
9317379 we knew it was a mathematical possibility but i certainly dont get up and bounce out of my house and think lets win by 100 points
9317380 i come to afl games knowing that if you dont compete hard and dont chase and tackle you get embarrassed very quickly so to be frank that was the furtherest thing from my mind until it became a mathematical possibility
9317381 but i can understand everyone being excited when almost an impossibility becomes real everyone gets excited
9317382 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9317383 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9317384 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9317385 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9317386 it was strongly suggested to me that i switch but my message has always been this job is about performance professionalism and leadership not politics
9317387 they can say what they want about this being a nonpartisan job
9317388 its very clear to me that the republicans tenaciously want to keep their hold on this position the governor gave them
9317389 it would have been the expeditious thing to do but i think it would have been self defeating
9317390 its obvious they didnt want to run against me they recognize im the strongest candidate
9317391 why else would they dump 200 000 into a smear campaign in a democratic primary to defeat one candidate
9317392 i have absolutely no ties to anybody in ken jennes regime
9317393 i asked if he would help and he offered to do a fund raiser for me
9317394 even though it may be difficult not to react to the market remember that saving for retirement is a marathon not a dash
9317395 history shows that the pain of a down market doesnt last forever losses from market declines are merely paper losses until the asset is actually sold
9317396 whether the current bear market has reached a bottom or not is unclear but one thing we know from this study is that market gains have more than made up for losses for those investors who stayed invested over the long term
9317397 the market has always recovered but by trying to predict the best time to buy and sell investors may miss the markets biggest gains

9317429 diese strecke ist dahingehend etwas besonderes als dass eine falsche ver nderung sofort dazu f hren kann dass du eine komplette sekunde liegen l sst
9317430 ich habe wirklich gehofft den wagen heute in die top 6 zu bringen aber wir haben beim zweiten run ein wenig zeit verloren
9317431 wir liegen ein wenig hinter der spitze zur ck hoffentlich finden wir noch bis zum rennstart das kleine st ck welches uns noch bis zu den schnellsten fehlt zumindest haben wir es unter die schnellsten 12 geschafft wir haben auf den stra enkursen definitiv die richtige richtung eingeschlagen
9317432 augusto das ist dein zweiter saisonerfolg und wahrscheinlich ein ganz besonderer da dein team hier ein heimspiel hat
9317433 ganz bestimmt ja wir waren hier schon im vergangenen jahr erfolgreich und haben es dieses mal geschafft das erste rennen zu gewinnen wir wussten eigentlich dass die pace gut sein w rde denn das training lief super im qualifying hatten wir leider einige schwierigkeiten wodurch wir nicht die position erreichen konnten die wir eigentlich h tten bekommen sollen
9317434 im warmup haben wir unseren speed dann wieder zeigen k nnen und schlie lich dann auch im rennen ich hatte einen prima start und habe mich in der ersten kurve aus allen scharm tzeln herausgehalten ich hatte nat rlich etwas gl ck denn die seats haben die anderen piloten etwas abgeschirmt
9317435 das hat mir in den ersten runden geholfen einen vorsprung aufzubauen dann kam rob wieder auf p2 und ich habe einfach weiter gepusht in so einem rennen macht man leicht einen fehler und kann nur schwerlich die konzentration aufrecht erhalten ich freue mich aber f r das team denn wir haben hier ein solches ergebnis gebraucht
9317436 du warst in allen trainingssitzungen der schnellste fahrer auf der strecke nur im qualifying nicht wie erkl rst du dir das
9317437 das ist schwer zu sagen auf meinem ersten satz reifen hatte ich einige probleme daher musste ich im zweiten anlauf umso mehr tun beim zweiten anlauf hatte ich reichlich verkehr auf der rennstrecke und als ich auf dem dritten reifensatz unterwegs war wurden gelbe flaggen geschwenkt die meisten fahrer sind allerdings auf die gleichen schwierigkeiten gesto en
9317438 ich konnte das auto also leider nicht dorthin stellen wo ich ihn gerne gehabt h tte das hat mir nat rlich sehr leid getan f r das team denn sie haben mir wieder ein perfektes auto an die hand gegeben wenn du so einen wagen zur verf gung hast dann musst du einfach das maximum herausholen das hat gestern leider nicht geklappt
9317439 ich freue mich daf r heute umso mehr das zeigt unser gesamtes potential und wie gut wir zusammenarbeiten leider liegen wir ziemlich weit zur ck aber es gibt noch viele punkte zu holen als rennfahrer musst du f r deine z hler nun einmal k mpfen und genau das werden wir auch weiterhin tun
9317440 keiner der gro en titelfavoriten hat heute gepunktet und du liegst nun nur noch 25 punkte zur ck wie siehst du die lage
9317441 naja an jedem rennwochenende kann man 20 z hler abgreifen und ich habe jetzt erst einmal zehn punkte geholt im zweiten rennen starte ich von p8 und das wird eine richtig schwierige aufgabe wir werden sehen
9317442 ich will aber nat rlich so viele punkte wie m glich mitnehmen die meisterschaft wollen wir auch im auge behalten aufgrund einiger probleme zu saisonbeginn bin ich einfach nicht in der position wo ich sein sollte das tut mir leid speziell f r das team ich gebe aber mein bestes und versuche zur ckzuschlagen
9317443 das auto war super ich hatte viel spa da drau en ich habe von der zweiten bis zur letzten kurve einige positionen gutgemacht es hat sich ausgezahlt bis zum schluss zu pushen
9317444 bei meinem stint war eine menge action ich hatte gehofft dass die beiden vor mir sich in die quere kommen als ich an die box kam war alles noch in ordnung dirk setzte sich rein und das pech hat zugeschlagen sowas passiert aber wenn dadurch die meisterschaft entschieden w rde w re das sehr schade
9317445 das war ein hartes rennen jim hat einen gro artigen job gemacht ich wollte dem fahrer des prototypen klarmachen dass ich mich im zweikampf befinde aber er hat schon zum berrunden angesetzt und fuhr mir den au enspiegel ab die reparatur hat wertvolle zeit gekostet mit dem platz unter den besten sechs bin ich aber sehr zufrieden
9317446 der defekt am anlasser ist der erste mechanische defekt in dieser saison und gerade jetzt k nnen wir so etwas am wenigsten brauchen aber wie hei t es so sch n es ist erst vorbei wenn es vorbei ist
9317447 wir vermuten ein elektrisches problem aber wir haben es noch nicht analysiert
9317448 nach der langen gerade und der vollgasrechts habe ich das gas zugemacht weil ich vom sechsten auf den vierten gang runterschalten wollte dann ist das motorrad einfach ausgegangen
9317449 der kolben hat nicht geklemmt das ist sicher wir vermuten ein elektrisches problem aber wir haben es noch nicht analysiert
9317450 wir hatten heute morgen im warmup schon probleme denn die motorendrehzahl ging nicht so hoch wie wir das wollten jetzt ist im rennen der ausfall passiert aber mit meiner leistung kann ich zufrieden sein
9317451 ich bin von elf auf drei gefahren und konnte mit di meglio und corsi k mpfen von daher bin ich zufrieden mit meiner leistung auch wenn es schade ist dass es so passiert ist
9317452 talmacsi und smith waren am anfang gleich weg da war nichts mehr zu machen
9317453 auf das podium h tte ich aber kommen k nnen das motorrad hat halt nicht mitgemacht aber ich mache meinen jungs keinen vorwurf denn von uns werksfahrern ist das jedem schon einmal passiert so etwas kann vorkommen
9317454 es ist ein neues ding das super funktioniert hat man mir gesagt
9317455 es hat ein bisschen gedauert die auf der strecke abzustimmen
9317456 es ist ein neues ding das super funktioniert hat man mir gesagt
9317457 ich habe meine arbeit schon gemacht und bin dann ein bisschen an den strand gegangen
9317458 jetzt schaue ich weiter nach amerika damit ich dort wieder auf das podium fahren kann
9317459 wenn ich zu hause bin werde ich versuchen ein computerspiel zu kaufen damit ich mir die kurvenf hrung anschauen kann indianapolis ist f r alle neue und wird bestimmt spannend ich hoffe dass ich dort wieder vorne dabei sein werde
9317460 if we start hitting and fielding now hell we could be 10 games ahead by oct 2 and wheres the made for tv movie in that
9317461 what if a team were mathematically eliminated and still managed to win wouldnt that be unbelieveable wouldnt that make a movie i mean woah id like to see the boston red sox faces after we come back from a 10 game deficit with only four games to go would that be great i mean woah hey lets do another dooby i mean woah
9317462 mit dem sieg hier in neuseeland hast du deine f hrung in der weltmeisterschaft ausgebaut und citro n konnte in der herstellerwertung etwas davonziehen aber was f r ein dramatischer tag
9317463 ja wobei andere wohl mehr dramen erlebt haben als ich f r uns war das ein unglaubliches finish heute morgen hatte ich eine gute ausgangslage um um den sieg zu fighten deshalb habe ich vom start weg attackiert ich habe einen fehler gemacht mich gedreht und zehn sekunden verloren in der n chsten pr fung habe ich noch mehr gas gegeben aber gegen mikko hirvonen konnte ich nichts ausrichten er war schneller als ich im mittagsservice haben wir die einstellungen ein bisschen ge ndert in der zweiten schleife habe ich dann versucht jari matti latvala zu schlagen denn gegen mikko konnte ich nicht ank mpfen dann ist jari matti abgeflogen und ich dachte dass mikko vielleicht unter druck w re ich dachte mir dass ich es noch einmal versuchen k nnte schlie lich hatte er einen plattfu und wir haben gewonnen
9317464 das war einer deiner seltenen fehler in der ersten pr fung am morgen was ist passiert
9317465 es lag nicht daran dass ich druck hatte ich habe an einer stelle einfach zu viel gewollt ich war ein bisschen berrascht habe die kontrolle ber das auto verloren bin zuviel gedriftet und konnte das auto nicht mehr abfangen
9317466 er war auf dem weg zum sieg und ich h tte vierter werden k nnen aber ich habe alles versucht das zu vermeiden
9317467 wie war deine einstellung als es in die vorletzte pr fung ging wolltest du pushen oder dich mit platz vier zufrieden geben
9317468 ich habe voll gepusht ich habe versucht druck zu machen ich wusste dass ich nicht 15 sekunden schneller sein konnte als die anderen aber es ist auch nicht so einfach in so einer situation mit nur 15 sekunden vorsprung zu f hren es ist eine lange pr fung und man bekommt druck von hinten man hat gewisse dinge im kopf ich habe alles versucht und ich habe es diesmal geschafft
9317469 hast du heute irgendwann daran gedacht dass du es nicht aufs podium schaffen k nntest da die anderen drei dein teamkollege dani sordo inklusive wirklich auch gas gegeben haben
9317470 ja aber ich wollte nicht dar ber nachdenken einmal habe ich gedacht vielleicht kann mikko gewinnen er war auf dem weg zum sieg und ich h tte vierter werden k nnen aber ich habe alles versucht das zu vermeiden ich wollte zweiter werden um nur zwei punkte zu verlieren
9317471 das problem ist dass die leute nur noch ber taktik reden und das ist nicht gut f r den rallyesport
9317472 die teamtaktiken von citro n und ford haben diese rallye interessant gemacht weil am letzten tag noch vier fahrer um den sieg gek mpft haben wie weit hat dir die taktik heute geholfen
9317473 ich wei es nicht ich wei nicht ob es die richtige taktik war vielleicht h tte ich nicht siegen k nnen klar gestern haben wir gedacht dass es der beste weg zum sieg ist das problem ist dass die leute nur noch ber taktik reden und das ist nicht gut f r den rallyesport
9317474 vielleicht sollte man ein anderes reglement finden damit es gute fights gibt und nicht mehr nur ber taktik und stra enfegen gesprochen wird f r die leute die keine richtigen rallyefans sind ist es schwer zu verstehen warum es immer auf die taktik ankommt ich denke nicht dass es ein guter weg ist ich fand das reglement im vergangenen jahr richtig gut der wm leader hatte es am ersten tag schwer dann war es eng und an den n chsten tagen richtig interessant

9317478 in jannah there is a gate which is called ar raiyan through which only those who observe saum fasting will enter on the day of resurrection

9317482 all the negotiating teams are back nothing was achieved in the latest round of engagement in south africa to break the deadlock we remain where we were
9317483 i can confirm that we went to south africa for separate bilateral discussions with the facilitator
9317484 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9317485 mr mugabe is showing no respect for southern african development community sadc no respect for the dialogue
9317486 as far as we are concerned to the extent that the dialogue has not been concluded there is no legitimate government in zimbabwe so he should not go to the un and au posing as the president of zimbabwe we will be taking up this matter with these organisations un and au

9317521 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9317522 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level

9317525 i guess if you take the individual issues two that i believe would be benchmarks showing whether youre a hard core republican conservative or not would be im a lifetime member of the n r a but this is alaska who isnt and i am pro life absolutely
9317526 i guess that puts me in a box of being hard core republican
9317527 the democrats also preach individual freedoms and individual rights capitalism free market let it do its thing best let people keep as much of their money that they earn as possible and when it comes to like the party machine no one will accuse me of being partisan

9317543 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose

9317553 if it were not that i would be putting my nation to hardship i would have ordered them to use the siwaak along with every wudoo
9317554 allaahs messenger sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam would kiss and embrace his wives while he was fasting but he had more power to control his desires than any of you
9317555 go deep when inhaling water during wudoo unless you are fasting
9317556 ramadan has come to you a blessed month allaah has made obligatory upon you its fasting in it the gates of heaven are open the gates of the hellfire are closed and the evil devils are chained to allaah belongs a night in it which is better than a thousand months whosoever is prevented from its good then he has been deprived
9317557 indeed allaah the most high has made the month of ramadan as a competition for his creatures in which they may race with one another to his pleasure by obeying him thus one group comes first and so they prosper and another group comes last and so they fail

9317567 do not fast until you see the new moon and do not stop fasting until you see it and if it is concealed by clouds then count out the thirty days of shaban for it
9317568 we are an illiterate nation that neither writes nor calculates i
9317569 fast when it the moon is seen and cease fasting when it is seen so if it is concealed by clouds then complete thirty days of shaban

9317571 there is no problem in cleaning ones teeth either using water
9317572 this is an erroneous claim this is what has been stated in the
9317573 chapter establishing the night prayer in the month of ramadhan and the virtues contained in it
9317574 there is no limit to its maximum since it is an optional prayer thus if the standing is lengthened whilst the number of prostrations is shortened i e the number of
9317575 that which umar ibn al khattab gathered the people upon is more beloved to us and that was eleven rakahs and that was the prayer of allahs messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam
9317576 i do not know from where they have introduced these numerous
9317577 umar ibn al khattab ordered ubayy ibn kab and tamim ud dari to lead the people in prayer with eleven
9317578 difference in opinion must not be a source of obstinacy nor anger
9317579 the fasting person must increase in obedience to allah and to keep away from all the prohibited meters
9317580 whosoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action then allah the mighty and majestic has no need that he should leave his food and drink
9317581 whosoever uses eye or ear drops for medicinal purposes then this does not invalidate their fast and this is the correct opinion
9317582 and we have not made for you any hardships in the religion

9317614 you gotta make as much money as you can because when we shut down and were gonna shut down thats it for a long while
9317615 most people dont have cars to leave dont have money for gas pay for a hotel for that long i mean you have to do whatever you have to do and i guess im gonna stay and work
9317616 i really dont have anywhere to go if i could leave i could go home but that doesnt seem like the thing to try too far i guess
9317617 our boss was into playing his trumpet down here more than he was into running a business so that all kinda went to hell and now im working here
9317618 ive never been through one and im not sure what to believe you see the national weather people and theyre telling you its gonna be really bad
9317619 i dont leave for nothing i didnt even leave for katrina
9317620 i mean look at the local weather guys they know what theyre doing not those weather channel people the local people say its gonna move north and thats enough for me
9317621 lot of folks around here are gonna make do with what they have and you wont hear a terrible amount of complaining
9317622 you cant just come in here and expect to hear people fussing about how they dont have nothing people just be used to not having much and so you dont even think too hard about it until someone starts asking you questions
9317623 now what do you think that would look like me and my little car sitting there in traffic with two big old rottweilers
9317624 guess im just gonna wait i just dont know its all stressful
9317625 its hard to explain to someone whos not from here why anyone would choose to stay
9317626 as long as i have power im good probably wont have power for long but this place is pretty tough
9317627 when you stand out there by that river and look at that levee
9317628 you are just so blessed to live here i am in love and so i make my choice
9317629 production will be shut down in the path of the storm
9317630 not every rig will be in the storms path but the oil companies tend to be very cautious
9317631 platforms have to withstand not just the winds but also waves rain and currents
9317632 if the storm was heading west or east then companies could just shut down one region of the gulf
9317633 but it looks to be heading through the center so a good portion of the gulf will be shut down
9317634 depending on the timing and impact the storm could really move this market
9317635 its not a far stretch to see oil back over 125 and gas back above 4
9317636 the bottom line is what the damage to the refineries will be but the markets still tend to overreact
9317637 well likely see a big spike in the price of gasoline prices
9317638 yes there will be an impact on the market but were much better prepared now than we were before katrina and rita
9317639 this storm will be a good test for the new standards

9317642 joining elizabeth may and joining the green party feels a lot like coming home
9317643 they deserve a strong voice in the house of commons and they deserve a strong voice in the leadership debate
9317644 this is the first time anyone with the house of commons parliamentary seal is wearing a green party button
9317645 a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9317646 mr gilles duceppe of the bloc quebecois has the opportunity to participate in the debates but not i theres something not quite right there
9317647 not only do i embrace the policies of my new party i will feel that all my past difficulties are justified if by my actions i can make a real difference by ensuring elizabeth may is included in the leaders debates

9317656 it became clear to us that the amount of time we spent taking care of pennies wasnt valuable in the long run
9317657 they think its a really good idea especially since parliament has been discussing getting rid of the penny its something the country is kind of moving towards
9317658 its something the cafe management thought was really great so were trying it out
9317659 if it continues to go well youll probably see this in our other cafes too
9317660 at the end of the day our cash is rarely off by very much
9317661 but i think at the same time the amount of time its going to save everyone would be outstanding
9317662 i think weve triggered an irreversible shift towards abolishing the penny
9317663 but i dont blame the local retailer for losing patience and unilaterally taking action
9317664 i dont expect to deal with that in the near future
9317665 the reason there are so many is because the penny is not used
9317666 there are still some people here and there that want to keep the penny as a symbol of heritage and the past the government doesnt want to put these people against them
9317667 all the progress weve made other than public opinion would be lost if an election takes place

9317749 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9317750 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

9317758 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9317759 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9317760 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that

9317762 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9317763 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9317764 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

9317771 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9317772 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9317773 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up

9317778 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate

9317781 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9317782 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9317783 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9317784 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9317785 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9317786 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9317787 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9317788 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9317789 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle

9317865 a mid year review of the chap common humanitarian action plan for 2008 showed that we needed more funding than we had first thought
9317866 this is partly because of increased food costs which is the largest single cost component and the new humanitarian needs in the country particularly in the north

9317923 then i left the egalitarianism of the classroom for the cubicle and everything changed the realization that the knowledge and skills acquired in school dont always translate at the office is something that all college graduates men and women must face but for women i have found the adjustment tends to be much harder
9317924 im not going to get involved with anybody or anything that could be construed as assisted suicide
9317925 its a legal constraint on me but i am determined to obey the law for the rest of my career
9317926 i dont feel guilty i just feel regret for the stress its caused my patients and my family
9317927 the subject comes up from time to time and people express their views
9317928 i feel it would be appropriate to have a system allowing people control of the end of their life
9317929 that would have to have significant safeguards so that vulnerable people were not disadvantaged the worry is that a person feels they are a burden to their families and might feel coerced into taking part in assisted suicide
9317930 i know the politicians have a lot of other things to consider but i think this is important
9317931 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

9317934 we need to do a really exceptional episodic piece every episode is just going to be like a punch in the face itll be exciting dramatic and tragic all at the same time

9317938 people talk about us winning cups here and ive got to say ive had some bad days at shrewsbury and oldham but in the main cup draws have never been that kind to us
9317939 even last year to go to metalist kharkiv in the uefa cup first round a good side everton won the tie 4 3 on aggregate now everybody knows standard liege is a really tough draw and blackburn in the league cup isnt the best either

9317948 my mousetrap is better than all the existing mousetraps on the market today
9317949 no one likes to have mice in their house but unfortunately most mousetraps do not effectively remove mice
9317950 in a traditional mousetrap mice frequently eat the cheese without getting caught
9317951 my mousetrap contains cheese inside a trapdoor which the mouse automatically triggers upon entering the trap the mouse is then caught inside along with the cheese
9317952 therefore my mousetrap is better than all the existing mousetraps on the market today
9317953 first i will examine the three top selling mousetraps on the market and their significant flaws then i will explain the research and development process for my mousetrap finally i will present two case studies of businesses that have successfully implemented my mousetraps

9318004 right wing is adept at turning the womens movement upside down and offering us a woman who reinforces patriarchal power rather than challenges it
9318005 this is like a frank capra movie if capra had been a right winger
9318006 they are more bloodthirsty they make their victims disappear they mutilate them they cut their ears off just as in the case of my daughter we do not know where she is
9318007 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9318008 for your continuing contempt toward other commenters feminism and this community because of a pattern of contemptuous behavior displayed particularly over the course of the past few weeks
9318009 im not a mod but heres what i think from the comments ive read by darren i dont think darren likes feminism from what hes written i think he actively dislikes it i think he wants it to be something else and that hes mad at feminists because they disagree with him about what it should be i think hes hostile towards it and i think he has ill will towards people that self identify as feminists i think his reasons for this are very different from those of republicans that feel the same way but i dont see how the path to all of that really matters oh and im so certain of this that ive stopped closely reading his comments when the subject turns to gender issues i think i know what hes going to say so i skim to see if theres anything new
9318010 although i agree that her looks and gender are not a reason to attack her they may be a reason to question mccain because this is the second time hes chosen an exceptionally good looking much younger woman as a partner is this going to be a pattern with him are we going to see a cabinet of beauty queens
9318011 t his is the second time hes chosen an exceptionally good looking much younger woman as a partner is this going to be a pattern with him
9318012 are we going to see a cabinet of beauty queens
9318013 well mccain might appoint a bunch of beauty queens to his cabinet but thats a good thing because im sure theyll all be as qualified and accomplished as palin is
9318014 if mccain appointed arnold schwarzenegger to his cabinet would you refer to him as a
9318015 if she gives her husband blow jobs would it be ok to describe her as a
9318016 if mccain appointed arnold schwarzenegger to his cabinet would you refer to him as a
9318017 well mccain might appoint a bunch of beauty queens to his cabinet but thats a good thing because im sure theyll all be as qualified and accomplished as palin is
9318018 mccain might appoint a bunch of beauty queens to his cabinet and thats a bad thing because there are undoubtedly uglier but more capable candidates available
9318019 i like your christ i do not like your christians your christians are so unlike your christ
9318020 i like your feminists principles i do not like your feminism
9318021 nyah nyah weve gots us someone you consider feminist on our side
9318022 the area has been transformed and is has made a big impact on the local community we are delighted with all the goodwill and help we have received
9318023 mccains choice of sarah palin is a move for real change every reformer and every hillary clinton supporter should take note they have an opportunity to reject a disappointing betrayal of their hopes and vote for real reform and real opportunity for women
9318024 it was rightfully noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9318025 now what does a vice president do im used to being busy
9318026 a bot meant to be able to interact conversationally with humans

9318029 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
9318030 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
9318031 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
9318032 i told the fans and the gaffer i would do a job anywhere in the team
9318033 were concentrating on the league because thats the main aim but its a good little cup to have a run in
9318034 i didnt play when doncaster got to wembley because i was on loan at the time
9318035 one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who always loses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason

9318038 a protected market will always wither when cheaper high quality imports flood in
9318039 the sport of sailing is huge from a participants point of view
9318040 people can enjoy this sport throughout their life whatever their level it can be athletic or not it allows you to travel and it is a very social sport that connects you with nature it is a sport that combines all those values however sailing struggles to make it in the mainstream media and on tv why is this
9318041 well it is hard to increase sailing airtime on tv you need to buy time the equipment is heavy etc according to me the solution is internet it has a huge potential ill give you an example during key west i proposed tv on internet 1500 people connected the first day then 5000 the second 30000 the third until 140000 people logged in on the last day
9318042 another example is the sailing events in the olympic games that didnt make it to tv but were on the internet it is a good solution for the future i think the key is that productions shouldnt be any longer than 3 minutes otherwise people get bored
9318043 the top sailors should also be the ambassadors of the sport but they are not always good at it they often want to take not give they have a huge responsibility
9318044 i see things differently i have done 650 tv shows mainly based on sailing ive also done 2100 lectures i do approximately 100 per year and written 900 articles
9318045 when i film boats i often struggle to get cameras on board in the americas cup teams often dont accept microphones on board this should be forced there is way too much paranoia the most interesting thing during a race is to listen to what happens on board
9318046 sailing definitely has a problem however this sport has all the ingredients to succeed and i have spent my life working to enhance its visibility
9318047 nothing was achieved in the latest round of engagement in south africa to break the deadlock we remain where we were
9318048 the zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9318049 exactly who i need exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and the country second
9318050 i cant begin this great effort without honouring the achievement of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course hillary clinton who showed determination in her presidential campaign
9318051 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9318052 as for that vp talk all the time i cant answer until someone answers me what is it exactly that a vp does every day
9318053 im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that this vp slot would be fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the kind of things we are trying to accomplish here for the rest of the us

9318070 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9318071 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9318072 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9318073 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9318074 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9318075 but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that
9318076 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9318077 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organizations
9318078 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms im not sure weve ever seen anything like it
9318079 new orleans will not have a shelter of last resort
9318080 if you choose to stay despite an evacuation order youll have limited resources you cant call 911 and expect someone to help
9318081 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9318082 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9318086 kids reach stages of adult sleep by age six roughly
9318087 more opportunity to get those symptoms usually associated with waking up after a bad dream
9318088 the person might scream look around be confused you can communicate with him hell respond hell remember what he dreamt about and can tell you in detail
9318089 our brains are going into high gear during rem sleep
9318090 a good example is the man who thinks hes playing football and thinks hes making a catch and injures himself falling on the floor
9318091 part of the human condition almost every parent of a young child has found the child sleeping somewhere hes not supposed to be
9318092 its not necessarily that they will cause violence but theyre just not fully conscious what you try to do is help them back to bed
9318093 yet if hes not awakened during the episode hes totally unaware in the morning thats generally true for sleepwalking too theres almost total amnesia
9318094 it could be because of training problems or it could be family problems
9318095 also many times enuresis is associated with underlying sleep deprivation restless sleep sleep fragmentation and sleep apnea
9318096 the question is do you want to give a medicine every single night that we know affects the brain
9318097 we dont know what effects it has we dont want to give a child a psychoactive drug every night for something that occurs rarely part of the decision is how frequently it occurs
9318098 it appears the arousal still happens but not the behaviors
9318099 its quite effective in children and adults and thats the treatment wed prefer

9318145 we have a united party we have a winning candidate
9318146 i was one of those conservatives who wasnt overly impressed with mccain
9318147 sarah palin is a person of unquestioned conservative credentials im excited about it
9318148 theres a whole new level of excitement to the campaign
9318149 it stops the momentum that the democratic convention was creating the gop base is ecstatic about this pick
9318150 the fact of the matter is this election comes down to two people obama and mccain
9318151 if we are conservatives and we have a problem accepting john mccain we have problems john mccain is clearly a conservative
9318152 there were a lot of deep negotiations a lot of tension
9318153 given what they had going it they came out all right

9318162 she has been there and made the choice she made the choice for life
9318163 she was faced with a decision of having an abortion and she decided she was going to be there for him it shows a lot about her character
9318164 it is a combination of enthusiasm for john mccain and the prospect of an obama administration that is to say the least sobering
9318165 she is a very gutsy young woman willing to take on special interests and corruption even when it was in her own party

9318185 the momentum of racism has increased with time and the perception of racial discrimination in the abuses in the implementation of the new economic policy
9318186 some of our leaders use religion to divide and rule
9318187 race and religion can go hand in hand but our leaders must stand for all and promote better religious harmony not all do and that is the sad thing
9318188 this government does not help in this area it gives us a perception that it is promoting superiority of a particular religion and race over others this is the main problem and it is not healthy
9318189 they can resort to force just like burma zimbabwe and other authoritarian states but it will come with a heavy price to pay we will be reduced to the rank of pariahs in the international community

9318193 the business of buying and reforming collective farms is suddenly and improbably very profitable attracting hedge fund managers russian oligarchs swedish portfolio investors and even a descendant of white russian migr nobility earlier reformers envisioned the collective farms eventually breaking up into family farms but the new business model rests on a belief that russias long painful history of collectivization is destined to end in large corporate factory farms

9318203 second the impact of co2 is nonlinear in the sense that each added unit contributes less than its predecessor for example if doubling co2 from its value in the late nineteenth century from about 290 parts per million by volume ppmv to 580 ppmv causes a 2 percent increase in radiative forcing then to obtain another 2 percent increase in radiative forcing we must increase co2 by an additional 580 ppmv rather than by another 290 ppmv at present the concentration of co2 is about 380 ppmv

9318237 president abbas and the palestinian leadership are determined to arrive at a complete agreement including all the issues but this depends on how serious the israeli side is
9318238 this government has no public legitimacy and certainly no legal legitimacy to sign any shelf accord or reach any understanding on jerusalem
9318239 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9318240 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9318241 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster

9318443 the problem with marxism is there is no real space for ethics okay there is plenty of space in it for the struggle of justice against injustice but the notion that an act is good or bad in itself there is no space for that there is no space for that which is outside time or if you wish for the eternal there is the possibility of it being combined with another philosophical view which is not simply materialist

9318447 i dont think there should be a cut in rates in the near term inflation is heading towards 5 per cent far ahead of target and rising ultimately the bank of englands job is to control inflation
9318448 the most they could possibly do is make a quarter point cut and that is not going to make any difference to growth
9318449 what happened to the senior officer i would suggest absolutely nothing while vast sums of money are spent on justifying the existence of the anti corruption command this is just one more piece of evidence where a blind eye is turned rather than have the metropolitan police service discredited
9318450 to satisfy the authority that the investigation was carried out to the highest standards and that no lines of inquiry were left unexplored
9318451 i felt the murder inquiry was warned off from pursuing edens statement because it would take the met down a corruption route it had covered up
9318452 she wouldnt have articulated one coherent policy and people would just be fawning all over her
9318453 tony and i looked at each other and it was like this isnt about policy or alaska issues this is about peoples most basic instincts i like you and you make me feel good

9318459 there was almost something wistful about it a sense that even in this day and age no one not even someone whos had a career like that of vice president cheney can really hope to fundamentally reshape our institutions

9318465 where we are its broad acre cropping but the market now is driving significantly more per megaliter from horticulture than you can get a profit margin out of wheat and barley
9318466 youve got from the biggest financial institutions down to auntie jane buying 10 megaliters of water
9318467 its now an asset just like a block of land and people are buying on a daily basis
9318468 what we want to do is to see water trading freed up so it can trade not only across regions but also across state borders

9318471 theres some speculation but people investing in water now are doing it as a way of investing in agriculture
9318472 what drives the price is the value of the produce that can be grown with the application of that water so really the price of commodities on international markets whether it be food or rice or cotton is having an impact on the value of water

9318534 they always say he was a maverick and this made me think well he really is he went all the way to alaska there arent that many people up there they dont have that many electoral votes and he picked this person i know people will say shes inexperienced but shes been a governor for 20 months thats more experience than obama has

9318555 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9318556 it is uncertain whether congress will take the administration up on its request
9318557 some republicans have already embraced the idea with representative lamar smith of texas the ranking republican on the judiciary committee introducing a measure almost identical to the administrations proposal
9318558 recalls a resolution known as the authorization for use of military force passed by congress on sept 14 2001 which authorized the president to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible for the sept 11 attacks to prevent future strikes that authorization still in effect was initially viewed by many members of congress who voted for it as the go ahead for the administration to invade afghanistan and overthrow the taliban which had given sanctuary to mr bin laden
9318559 but the military authorization became the secret legal basis for some of the administrations most controversial legal tactics including the wiretapping program and that still gnaws at some members of congress
9318560 the whole obama narrative is built around the narrative that obama and campaign strategist david axelrod built and like all stories its not entirely true
9318561 his constituents the media and his political opponents to fully examine him
9318562 pattern of rarely volunteering information or documents even when relatively innocuous
9318563 as the president of the law review obama didnt write articles he edited and reviewed them
9318564 marv do you sometimes wish you had more colorful feathers like say a macaw
9318565 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9318566 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9318567 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9318568 yes i would like to see alaskas infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9318569 despite the work of our congressional delegation we are about 329 million short of full funding for the bridge project and its clear that congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between ketchikan and gravina island
9318570 earmarks are not bad in themselves in fact they represent a legitimate exercise of congress constitutional power to amend the budget proposed by the president
9318571 so n so could really use your prayer right now you may not know but yada yada
9318572 for me 1 2 and 3 make the most sense
9318573 oh i never thought about a thats interesting but how does 3 fit in for you
9318574 were delighted with that because weve been disappointed by the first three games
9318575 we knew we had to win and you could see that we realised you have to raise your game including the work rate

9318578 obama has received overwhelming support from black voters many of whom believe he will help bridge the nations racial divide
9318579 they fear that growing numbers of white voters and policy makers will decide that eradicating racial discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity have largely been done
9318580 she said mr obama cast a wide net his goals and values were really clear from the way he approached it he wanted somebody who was an independent thinker
9318581 they presented the information to mr obama in a handful of private sessions ms kennedy said and she watched mr obama work his way to selecting senator joseph r biden jr she said the search showed her another side of mr obama
9318582 ive campaigned with him and seen him in large settings ms
9318583 speakers have hammered home barack obamas change theme using the word about ten times as often as they did in 2004
9318584 also on the upswing more mentions of the economy iran and iraq
9318585 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9318586 my players have shown what they are about and we played some really good football
9318587 our lads kept working and i thought they were smashing
9318588 to lose the game to a mis hit shot so late in the game is disappointing
9318589 we need competition and depth in lots of areas and one of those is definitely at centre half
9318590 we need players whove played in the premier league before
9318591 ive been a little bit annoyed all week and the response has been good
9318592 but i dont want to be coming back saying the response was good after basingstoke because we didnt turn up
9318593 the difference was unbelievable and to be fair to the players it was all down to them
9318594 they know we didnt put in a great performance in the first half against bath but the annoying thing was that we did it in the second half
9318595 thats what we got him in for and we have missed him
9318596 matt will hold his hand up as well he didnt have the best game and a half and then he got injured but hes stepped up two leagues
9318597 people have seen him in pre season and thought wow and you expect him to do that week in week out but wingers dont do it week in week out
9318598 our lads kept working and i thought they were smashing
9318599 to lose the game to a mis hit shot so late in the game is disappointing
9318600 we need competition and depth in lots of areas and one of those is definitely at centre half
9318601 we need players whove played in the premier league before
9318602 the performances have been ok especially in the three drawn games away from home
9318603 today the lads got what they deserved for those performances and they were good value for the win
9318604 he came on at half time against tamworth and had a big influence there when we got back into the game
9318605 i thought he was brilliant for the 90 minutes today and thoroughly deserved his goal while he also got us a penalty
9318606 we always try and do our homework and we had done that for today which led to us causing them problems down their left hand side
9318607 we were always going to try and do that with owen storey so the scouting paid off
9318608 the vast majority of our teachers are doing an excellent job
9318609 as i go round the country heads tell me how difficult it is to get rid of weak teachers
9318610 they say they start the procedure and they might be 18 months down the line and the teacher will move we need to be thinking of ways of preventing that
9318611 that isnt ofsteds role but i sympathise with head teachers about that
9318612 the childrens plan we published last december set out proposals to improve the performance of teachers who have the greatest difficulty in carrying out their role effectively including a proposal to help underperforming teachers leave the profession if that is appropriate and removing their qualified teacher status
9318613 we are working with the general teaching council to make sure they use their powers which include prohibiting someone from teaching to make sure no child has to put up with a substandard teacher

9318622 we know that the campaign has been effective in changing hand hygiene behaviour in hospitals and now were taking it outside hospitals to fight infection from as many angles as possible
9318623 about 20 to 25 of the national wheat crop has been cut now and ripening crops that remain are increasingly vulnerable to weather damage to quality particularly in southern and eastern regions
9318624 with drying grain much more expensive than previous years due to steep increases in fuel cost farmers are still hoping for a good long run of dry weather ideally bringing moisture content to below 15 where drying would not be necessary
9318625 in other years 90 to 100 of the regions crop would have been harvested by now
9318626 one of the birds was actually taken from underneath its mother

9318693 okay a baby brought a woman back to life thats easy to explain mass hallucination a really boring afternoon too many cocktails
9318694 thirty people saw something i saw a two headed calf once honest drinking cutty i had the damndest time getting rid of him the next morning taurus is a bad sign for me
9318695 from the descriptions this peter simon could have been the one at the peaks
9318696 you found jesus in drag and you want me to interview him my friend lena said hed be a leather dyke this time is this turning anti lesbian joe we publish a weekly gay rag which is read by very few none of whom has heretofore exhibited any interest in matters religious or philosophical why us why me
9318697 talk to bruno and nate first see me when you finish
9318698 jesus instructed us to forgive those who have wronged us seventy times seven times
9318699 i have called you by name you are mine when you pass through raging waters they shall not overwhelm you when you walk through fire you shall not be burned
9318700 let me tell you a little story about a man named jeb
9318701 hey brother is the guy from beverly hillbillies named jeb or jed
9318702 that means ten more fridays you guys are excellent during the week but fridays are always out of control youve gotta help me out here i will take any and all suggestions
9318703 i dont know if i could stomach watching charlton heston for the next ten fridays what other religious themed movies can you guys come up with
9318704 but youre a brother could they really fire you for showing us that
9318705 my mom was one of those protestors the movie totally blasphemes jesus i mean they show him making out with mary magdalene
9318706 how can you protest a movie you havent even seen
9318707 cmon guys im an italian from brooklyn its basically a requirement for me to see every scorsese movie
9318708 how could a brother see a movie that the church is against
9318709 actually i found the movie deeply moving if anything it only helped me to better understand my vows seeing a more human jesus struggling with his calling and dealing with desires was much more relatable to me than the images of jesus i grew up with when i was growing up we had a picture hanging in our living room of jesus with the sacred heart bursting out of his chest it used to give me the creeps
9318710 look guys the movies rated r so i cant show it to you anyway what other religious movies can you think of
9318711 about you about why you decided to become a brother
9318712 i mean it is pretty weird for somebody like you to do something like that
9318713 i mean all the other brothers are like old and ugly but you can like still get a lot of girls
9318714 but i dont see how a discussion about me fits in to the curriculum of this class
9318715 its exactly the point of this class i mean what better way of learning about religion than through a young guy whos giving up everything for it
9318716 let me think about it this weekend and ill let you guys know next week now before we go we need to talk about seventy times seven
9318717 open your new testaments to matthew chapter eighteen verses twenty one and twenty two paul would you read this aloud for us
9318718 then peter went up to jesus and said lord how often must i forgive my neighbor if he wrongs me as often as seven times jesus answered not seven i tell you but seventy times seven times
9318719 thanks now what do you guys think jesus meant by this
9318720 well if you do the math thats four hundred and ninety times so if your neighbor wrongs you four hundred and ninety one times then you dont have to forgive him
9318721 thats one way of looking at it who has another interpretation
9318722 i dont think jesus wanted peter to take it that literally i think jesus was saying that we have to forgive people over and over again even if they keep screwing with us ive got a problem with that are you saying that if somebody raped my little sister that i need to forgive him i couldnt do that once let alone four hundred and ninety times could you do that brother
9318723 but i know thats what jesus is calling us to nobody said being a christian was easy in fact in our world today its a real challenge isnt it is there anybody in the class willing to share a personal story of forgiveness
9318724 how bout you bro i mean if fridays are going to become ask brother vito days this is as good a day as any to start
9318725 okay dont go anywhere guys your homework for the weekend is to write about a time in your life when you needed to forgive someone please dont ask me how many pages id rather have half a page of truth than three pages of b s okay great enjoy your weekend
9318726 hey fidel have you considered going on the freshman retreat next weekend its your last chance you know
9318727 the brothers have a beautiful retreat house upstate in poughkeepsie where you can hike swim fish its just about getting away for the weekend away from the city to be honest there is some prayer involved but its something i think you would find worthwhile
9318728 ill talk it over with my mom and let you know on monday
9318729 good deal and thanks for the suggestion about ask brother vito day i think that could work
9318730 so do you have a lot of homework this weekend
9318731 yeah i got to read this stupid story for english
9318732 the ministers black veil by hawthorne you ever read it

9318744 well if what we heard on the bbc is true the war is not going our way yet but if they are already committing suicide things are bad for them and will get worse
9318745 i suppose no army ever lost because of many suicides though

9318846 nicht die fraktion oder der landesvorstand entscheidet ber unsere politik sondern die gesamtpartei
9318847 solange man aber einfach nur den tank voll macht passiert nichts
9318848 das einzige was wir von den g nstigen preisen in luxemburg haben ist l rm und gestank
9318849 es gab sogar eine zeit da konnte man mit dem auto nicht aus zewen rausfahren weil die stra e blockiert war oder die leute zu schnell vorbei gefahren sind
9318850 die leute kommen fter aber sie tanken nicht voll sondern nur so acht bis neun liter
9318851 ich kriege heute noch genau soviel provision wie vor 40 jahren
9318852 manche l gen mich auch an und behaupten sie w rden ihren ohnehin schon gut gef llten tank nur auff llen wollen das mag ich gar nicht
9318853 aber dass die leute sparen wollen kann ich ihnen ja nicht krumm nehmen die m ssen halt auch schauen wie sie ber die runden kommen
9318854 vom ersten moment an muss das anders aussehen wir m ssen jetzt mal drei punkte einsammeln
9318855 jeder sieg ist wichtig noch wichtiger ist dass die spieler merken sie kommen voran
9318856 wenn die mannschaft umsetzt was sie im training zeigt werden wir hertha knacken
9318857 ich bin mir ganz sicher dass wir schon bald ins rollen kommen wenn die mannschaft umsetzt was sie im training zeigt werden wir hertha knacken
9318858 wir m ssen ans limit gehen und den bayern weh tun
9318859 viele spieler glauben dass wir dort als mannschaft etwas erreichen k nnen
9318860 wir m ssen ans limit gehen und den bayern weh tun
9318861 das sieht nat rlich nicht gut aus dass wir noch kein tor geschossen haben aber in den ersten beiden spielen wurden in allen mannschaftsteilen fehler begangen
9318862 er f hlt sich nicht so gut wie er sich als f hrungsspieler f hlen m sste
9318863 das ist mehr als wir im gesamten vierten quartal 2007 gesammelt haben

9318868 die dtm wird auch von den formel 1 kollegen beobachtet
9318869 nat rlich ist es der traum fast eines jeden mannes eine motorsportlizenz zu machen und rennen zu fahren daf r br uchte ich allerdings mehr zeit die ich so noch nicht habe
9318870 die piloten der dtm sind alle hochtrainierte sportler sehr beeindruckend
9318871 morgens esse ich eigentlich nur eine kleinigkeit das fr hst ck von sarah war sehr vielf ltig eindeutig ein besserer start in den tag
9318872 wir brauchen zus tzliche leitungen doch auch hier schleppen sich die genehmigungsverfahren hin
9318873 als es sagenhaften wind gab wegen der fehlenden leitungen den vom deutschen verbraucher hoch subventionierten strom ins ausland verschenken m ssen
9318874 ein riesenschritt wenn ich den strom speichern kann und mit dem elektroauto h tte ich einen entsprechenden speicher der den strom auch ber nacht abnimmt
9318875 brauchen wir aber eine energiepolitische gesamtstrategie in deutschland und aus meiner sicht auch ein energieministerium
9318876 das was wir jetzt begonnen haben wird nach sieben jahren rund 100 000 tonnen biomasse pro jahr bringen
9318877 wir k nnen diese kohle in unseren biomassekraftwerke verbrennen aber auch in unseren kohlekraftwerken

9318881 weve been a very good team in the regular season the last two years
9318882 but weve had our bumps and hit the wall in the playoffs for some reason
9318883 we have playoff experience and now weve got some guys who have won stanley cups now maybe a little fresher approach or a different approach will help us get over the hump
9318884 hell i guarantee the content co opters at abel to yzerman were about to link this article under the heading
9318885 i realize its the slow summer season but can this guy tone down the tough guy histrionics his posts are fatiguing on an otherwise excellent site
9318886 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season
9318887 its just a shame that the most classless uneducated lowbrow fanbase in the league gets this sweep red wing fans dont deserve their team
9318888 ill tell you this they have not much coming bobby ryan has been a questionable pick at no 2 overall in 2005 and up until this draft they tried to move down and did a nice job of trying to replenish their depth chart they had nothing coming and that appears to be his m o
9318889 my priority remains signing with the rangers and finishing the job i came here to do two years ago ive spoken with tom renney and have told him that im willing to accept whatever role he thinks is best for the team
9318890 i want to stay in new york because i believe i can contribute but if that door closes ill have some other interesting options to consider
9318891 i heard from a friend about a program called teacher next door and decided to look into it
9318892 its similar in concept to some apartment developments that give discounts to police because they want to encourage them to live and be seen in the community
9318893 these homes are in neighborhoods that have some combination of vacancies or low owner occupancy rates they essentially need a boost
9318894 its been cheaper to buy a home than rent an apartment
9318895 its an incentive to live in the city i can see myself staying long term
9318896 i was talking about buying a new car and he said you already have a car
9318897 there were two big holes one in the basement and the other in the living room ceiling
9318898 when i heard that i was to receive the award i was truly honoured
9318899 to join the list of formidable recipients of the tom wheatcroft trophy is a rare privilege
9318900 ive never forgotten the wet race at donington in 1993 not so much for the thrashing that ayrton senna gave us but for the fact that the race was privately funded by tom driven by his love and enthusiasm for the motor racing
9318901 this neighborhood at the time of which i am speaking was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men
9318902 there was the story of doffue martling a large blue bearded dutchman who had nearly taken a british frigate with an old iron nine pounder from a mud breastwork only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge

9318913 we havent approved a fee hike for all the sfis there are a few institutes whose fees have been slashed since they lacked adequate infrastructure the fee reduction is between rs 1 000 and rs 5 000

9318918 they had been persuaded to conclude their protest in what the event organizers called the free speech zone this was a cage between the security zone and the public zone in which protesters were invited to demonstrate their concerns to the gathered delegates of the democratic party

9318924 dont you think you should be considering your position prime minister given you have had full knowledge of this lie for the last eight months
9318925 he may use all this publicity to target the mad elderly pakeha racist vote and get up to 5
9318926 did clark know about this tape and if so why did she not act upon it
9318927 with a politician who says he wont deal with peters even if it means he wont become prime minister
9318928 who else would have the gall to write a post linking it to a story on his own website written by himself as authentication
9318929 dpf of course you did and like anderton you just dont know how to deal with a politician who says he wont deal with peters even if it means he wont become prime minister its called integrity
9318930 its always seemed to me that somewhere someplace there must have been some kind of contribution but it wasnt clear where
9318931 just who was it that tipped off english to ask the question that forced clark to confess all

9318936 yes money talks madam speaker but nothng talks quite like the truth and the truth of this bill is
9318937 she will know these allegations are vile malevolent evil and wrong
9318938 one of the biggest problems we have in new zealand is that we judge the morality of larceny in accordance with the scale of it low socio economic individuals who find themselves on the wrong side of the law are dealt with more harshly than those who take tens of millions in shonky deals and set up family trusts to hide their assets in fact in some cases the unscrupulous rich are held up as role models of our society these people have the cheek to hold themselves up as true pillars of the community when they are really part of the rotten foundations
9318939 the good people of that electorate aint stupid and wont like being instructed how to vote
9318940 a couple of years ago i was like you know enough of this i dont need it it was literally something that happened one morning like yknow f k that
9318941 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century

9318944 bryans idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world
9318945 there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact german foreign minister ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself
9318946 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy

9318950 do you have the duo core optimizer from that page installed
9318951 they have to be concerned myself im ready i put all the stuff there i try to put the best lineup out there i root for them
9318952 im behind them 100 percent but in games like that its up to the players how theyre going to handle it how theyre going to show up and play
9318953 you can do so much to make them go out and fight they are the ones that have to fight we are in the corner we have to continue to go out and play and hopefully we play better
9318954 but dont lie down and make this game another game the games coming are not another game they are important games and theres no doubt we have to get better
9318955 the first couple of innings i felt like i was making some quality pitches and they were getting hits
9318956 from that third inning on i was just leaving everything up and they were putting balls in play and getting flyballs it was just one of those games
9318957 when buehrles high thats what hes going to get he cant afford to be high up in the strike zone because thats not his pitching philosophy he has to keep the ball down change speeds the last couple of times hes been high and every time hes high hes going to get killed
9318958 coming in here we knew they had a very good club and they play very well here
9318959 i mean we have good pitching and the bottom line is they have come out the last couple of days and swung the bats well put pressure on our defense and they have got two good pitching performances as well
9318960 this guy is on fire no matter what you throw up there hes going to get it
9318961 sometime tonight well grill dinner there over charcoal while distant coyotes bay at the moon and stars sparkle in a black sky that seems to stretch from yesterday to tomorrow and beyond for now this clean cold river envelopes our boat as our flies nymphs drift near the bottom carried downstream at the exact speed of the current

9318963 john mccains advisers predicted weeks ago that the presumptive republican nominee would use his national convention week to try to recapture his image as a maverick reformer and shake up the presidential race he did just that friday with his surprise choice of alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9318964 the decision brings the senator from arizona immediate dividends with his base and eventually perhaps with swing voters
9318965 mccains hope is that with sen hillary rodham clinton n y now on the sidelines palin can help close a sizable gap with obama among female voters that threatens to block his path to the white house
9318966 has put someone who democrats argue has even less experience than barack obama one election and a heartbeat away from the presidency
9318967 mccain was looking for ways to counter the democrats argument that he is merely an extension of president bush and concluded that he needed a game changing decision with all the risks that entailed

9318976 fdi in the resource sector offers a number of advantages to the host country including the provision of capital technology know how and access to markets
9318977 these linkages provide a basis for the marketing and distribution of the output of mineral projects
9318978 unnecessary regulation of capital from this source into the australian market will not only be detrimental to australian economic interests by driving it to other markets but is likely to encourage a retreat to appeals to the power of the state in ways that are likely to be damaging to both our long term economic and political interests
9318979 the application of special conditions for these investments would reinforce the perception of the primacy of regulatory solutions over market solutions and help sustain the dominance of the bureaucracy over the market in china
9318980 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation
9318981 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us
9318982 the main driver for the more modest gdp outcome for the quarter is likely to be weak household consumption
9318983 we are looking for quite a flat picture for consumption
9318984 we have higher interest rates and the credit crunch biting but the commodity boom has been supporting growth
9318985 export volumes have been surprisingly strong given the australian dollar and we have seen the volumes of imports soften in response to softening domestic demand
9318986 the equipment side of things that feeds the gdp number
9318987 thats makes some discussion of a negative outcome for the gdp number no longer relevant
9318988 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day
9318989 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band
9318990 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset writedowns continue
9318991 its original roots were in protection of dark skies for astronomical purposes but very early on the dark sky association began working with industry and designers
9318992 put the light on the ground where you want it
9318993 low glare environment for the visual task whether its a roadway a sports field or a parking lot
9318994 working to address the problem one bad light at a time
9318995 its one of those issues where there is no good reason to waste money and energy with intelligent planning and design you put lighting where you need it and dont put it where you dont need it like in the sky
9318996 its turned into a quality of life issue and a green issue
9318997 during the month of august they hitmen killed eight us citizens and injured five more on this side of the border
9318998 although mexican citizens are the main victims of these crimes the uncertain security situation also implies a risk for us citizens

9319000 although mexican citizens are the main victims of these crimes the uncertain security situation also implies a risk for us citizens
9319001 the value of the ucce system is immense but there are a lot of people who dont understand it
9319002 if you look at someone like andrew strauss who wanted to continue his education at durham university but he also needed somewhere to continue with his cricket and durham ucce provided that
9319003 otherwise his cricket would have gone backwards during his three years at university and he may have been lost to the system and there are plenty of others like him
9319004 the likes of atherton derek pringle and strauss wanted to go and finish their education but if you scrap the ucce system it would be much more difficult for them to become professional cricketers and who knows they might even be lost to the system altogether
9319005 we teach our young players about diet and nutrition training methods and all sorts of things like that they are a lot more rounded as individuals than i was when i left durham university and began playing for lancashire
9319006 captivate and inspire people of every age gender background and ability while building bridges between continents countries and communities
9319007 we have already made strides alongside the asian cricket council in developing the game in china and realise it is a long term project rather than something that will come together in just a handful of years
9319008 with inderjit now joining us to provide added impetus in this area we have the chance to take the game in china to the next level
9319009 the work in developing the game in china is exciting
9319010 it has a huge potential for growth and with the asian cricket council we will explore ways of ensuring cricket is able to get a secure foothold within the country that we can continue to build upon

9319025 tim bermain relatif bagus di arena yang selalu dihiasi trik trik dengan mempertimbangkan hal tersebut maka kami dapat mengatakan bahwa itu adalah hasil yang bagus
9319026 di sini tidak seperti di inggris di sini selalu terdapat tekanan dalam level yang konstan dan tidak ada pertandingan yang mudah namun kupikir mourinho telah memahaminya pertandingan ini dapat menjadi pelajaran yang bagus untuknya
9319027 disamping itu kami juga memetik hasil imbang di partai perdana musim lalu dan mengakhirinya dengan scudetto maka mari kita berharap agar tradisi ini terus belanjut
9319028 kami tidak membutuhkan quaresma serangan inter berjalan baik saat menghadapi sampdoria dan ia tidak dibutuhkan
9319029 saya telah berbicara kepada bernd schuster dan pedja predrag mijatovic bahwa saya ingin hengkang dari klub ini agenku telah bertemu dengan pihak klub ribuan kali untuk membicarakan hal ini dengan mereka dalam pertemuan tersebut klub sama sekali tidak menunjukkan ketertarikannya untuk mempertahankanku kini setelah klub gagal mendatangkan orang pemain lain tiba tiba mereka ingin agar saya bertahan
9319030 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i saw which is what i was upset about
9319031 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
9319032 to your guys the song tell a story about the
9319033 im still in shock over being engaged and having the ring on my finger
9319034 we dont come from harrow we dont know anything about harrow tell us some harrow stories
9319035 i wish i could go and see my family for a week richard and my dogs and go to the supermarket and then come back here for another week
9319036 he couldnt even read a laminate let alone host a gameshow ill be the host
9319037 the moneys as good as in the bank you might as well consider yourself 100 000 richer
9319038 i want to see the guy who can handle the beast
9319039 this is a fresh new start youve got to hope
9319040 dont be so worried love ol aron isnt gonna hurt you come have a seat i prefer to drink with company
9319041 kurori hmm a pretty name for a pretty woman you dont need formalities with me love im just an old hermit not some lord
9319042 ho ho youre not the first lady to say that and trust me its full of surprises
9319043 would you be so kind love as to give the lady over there this letter id give it to her myself but she looks the type to kill you just for looking at her the tea was excellent ill have to come back some time
9319044 miss b batesu sama a man gave me something to give to you
9319045 little oyabun my name is aron becker and i understand you lead the gokiburi gumi your little band has done some fairly terrible things and im afraid i cant let that continue i know who each of you are and will engage any of you on sight killing your boys would be a bit much but i will beat some sense into any who face me basically i just want to beat some sense into you all i want a war
9319046 he wants a war give im a war send saburo after him
9319047 theres some old man causing trouble he wears a cloak has a huge beard and lots o hair kill him got it
9319048 good according to kurori he should be back soon stay around the teahouse dont wreck it while you fight
9319049 since it is impossible to beat the we have to follow it in other words the success of realizing the semantic web relies on whether we can persuade normal users into believing that they are contributing primarily to themselves
9319050 the spoils of the ocean due to the capitol and the palatium
9319051 if you can get guys like charles you need someone to back him up
9319052 i would love the job theres no question about that but you have to weigh up your life
9319053 i was thinking i could do it and i would love the job but its a question if i want it or not
9319054 there are a lot of people who could do that job
9319055 you need someone who has the ability to come in sees what needs to be done and get on with it
9319056 he cannot be hampered by people saying this is the way its been done in the past and the way were doing things now youve got to have someone who says no that isnt good enough
9319057 were not getting the right results for the money that is being poured into our sport its as simple as that accountability now has to come into it
9319058 theyre going to have to upset people theyll have to go in there and start carving things up making sure that its best for the athletes rather than the system
9319059 but they need someone that when theyre out on the warm up track just about to go out into the olympic stadium tells them this is what youve got to do
9319060 no messing around youre not going to fall off the back of the pace and just hang around and finish in eighth or ninth weve supported you youre good enough get out there and start winning medals
9319061 i think from what i see he was doing a brilliant job i havent heard the criticism or negative things
9319062 hes more than capable of doing what he needs to do he has a team around him that assists him getting the team where they need to be
9319063 nothing was achieved in the latest round of engagement in south africa to break the deadlock we remain where we were
9319064 the zanu pf dismissed the suggestion not just as insolent but also stunning ignorance on how government works
9319065 i remember that it was like the whole world hated me i felt utterly alone i was only 13 and didnt have the where with all to cope
9319066 everyone just stood by and watched many even joined in youre either with the bullies i suppose or against them they were afraid that if they stepped in the bullies would start on them
9319067 so it was a very claustrophobic world a world in which i seemed to be the only inhabitant and that was very sad for me in many ways it still is
9319068 so when i began my search to meet the bully and hopefully lay to rest the terrors of my past it brought back many of the negative emotions that i had felt as a young boy
9319069 what was he going to call me how would he treat me would he sneer and mock me one more time how would i react im bigger and stronger now would he even remember me
9319070 this road that i was leading myself down had many potentially negative pitfalls what was i going to do
9319071 its strange looking back over the past 25 years ive learnt to cope and have been able to draw on lifes experiences but it has not been easy
9319072 making this film has not always offered the answers to my questions or the solutions to my problems
9319073 its so real as i say i can close my eyes and i can just see it all happening and i can see it all unfolding
9319074 ive spent nearly 13 years now going through it all in my head and thinking what could i have done differently to change it
9319075 when you meet people who have similar experiences to you it makes you feel very humble that they can sit down and share their intimate and hurtful stories with you
9319076 i really admire their courage and hope that the film lives up to their expectations that it will help and focus peoples minds whether victim or perpetrator whether family or friend that bullying isnt just harmless fun
9319077 bullying leaves its scar a scar that can appear in the most unexpected circumstances at the most inappropriate time a scar that you never want anyone to see
9319078 i think when it comes to somebody being victimised you are obviously a very good example because we know from research and from anecdotal evidence how childrens concentration goes because all ones cognitive resources are simply going towards how to keep safe
9319079 you probably experienced great tension you probably experienced disturbed sleep the worry of whats happening to them once the bell rings and they are out in the corridor or out in the playground or whatever
9319080 it is so important to dispel the myth that bullying is a normal part of growing up and that its character building it is nothing of the sort
9319081 we know that quite apart from the physical injuries its the psychological injuries and the name calling and we know now that this can essentially change somebodys identity and words can break your heart
9319082 so what is normal about that what is character forming about that
9319083 there was a lot of pain in making this journey and even afterwards i still ask myself was it all worthwhile what have i really achieved
9319084 its only now almost two years later that it has begun to make sense that i have started to feel a form of closure
9319085 i must say though i am very nervous about the film being broadcast i feel that it will show a side of me that i have bottled up for years kept hidden
9319086 now its out there for all to see i hope the film goes in some way to highlight the pain and suffering that bullying causes and if even one person has second thoughts about making someone else feel bad about who they are then it will have achieved its goal
9319087 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9319088 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9319089 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9319090 we can no longer live we cant be safe anywhere
9319091 i hope those in government do their jobs otherwise they should resign
9319092 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9319093 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9319094 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9319095 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9319096 and it is warm not something im really used to
9319097 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9319098 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful

9319110 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods
9319111 but their numbers are in lakhs hundreds of thousands and we require more resources more boats army and rescue efforts to evacuate them
9319112 i presented my buffalo to the boatman in exchange for a place in his boat since i dont have any money
9319113 the public has no idea whether those studies have been submitted to the epa or not and if so what they show maybe they never came in maybe they came in and they show a real problem for bees maybe theyre poorly conducted studies that dont satisfy epas requirement
9319114 weve been monitoring the bee die off situation for a couple of years and its a complex puzzle that may also involve mites viruses and other factors
9319115 we want this information now we cannot continue to wait bees are disappearing our whole existence depends on them because we eat the flowers need to be pollinated and the only ones to do it are the bees

9319119 its just about going out and showing it every week coach richt has been real big about reminding us to not buy into the hype
9319120 it was loud when they called out were no 1 that was kind of cool but other than that it feels just like another season youve got to grind its a long year in the sec
9319121 it is one game but when your defense holds arguably one of the best running back tandems to 20 yards total confidence wise what do you think that could do
9319122 well its one game you know confidence can screw you up confidence can be a good thing you know but what our players need to understand what our fans need to understand what everybody needs to understand its one game its one game aight and we need to keep playin better and we need to improve and our players need to have the focus to improve
9319123 and remember how they got where they got rather than think we can just show up now and beat whoever we play cause we have a tendency to think that way around here
9319124 instead of just kickin peoples like youre supposed to and workin to do it aight so when you ask me those kind of questions it really pi e me off im not pi ed off at you aight but that mentality you gotta work and earn it and you gotta earn it in the next game and what we did tonight it was great we won one game we got eleven more we need to take em one game at a time and we need to improve as a team
9319125 and thats what our team needs to be focused on

9319127 en el a o 2000 se llegaron a trasvasar del tajo segura a murcia 600 hect metros c bicos mientras que en 2007 s lo fueron 200 hm3
9319128 la pol tica socialista sigue siendo la pol tica que pasa por cargarse los trasvases ya que lo hicieron con el ebro
9319129 defender ese trasvase asegurando no s lo su vigencia sino tambi n que contin e con el caudal necesario
9319130 no vamos a aceptar que el psoe vuelva a dar gato por liebre ya que es experto en la manipulaci n y el enga o
9319131 est n intentando cargarse el tajo segura por la puerta de atr s estudiando por ejemplo por parte del gobierno central duplicar el caudal ecol gico actual
9319132 no nos vamos a callar ni a estar quietos ante esta estrategia oculta y da ina para murcia
9319133 seguiremos exigiendo el agua que la regi n de murcia necesita
9319134 est representando en murcia un papel falso y sin embargo en madrid da la cara a su partido de que es muy d cil en este tema
9319135 hay que exigir que el tajo segura siga vigente y que tenga el caudal que necesita para murcia ya que el agua es de todos los espa oles para el pp y compete a un s lo gobierno el central asumir la responsabilidad de garantizarla tambi n a todos los espa oles
9319136 se seguir defendiendo la planificaci n hidrol gica al ser una competencia del ejecutivo de la naci n y muy especialmente cuando es una planificaci n que afecta a varias comunidades

9319140 der markt bewegt sich seitw rts dabei gibt es jede menge kreativit t bei den europ ischen entwicklern von handyspielen und viele tolle ideen
9319141 in japan bekommt der entwickler gut 90 prozent in den usa noch rund 70 und in europa gerade noch 50 prozent pro verkauftem spiel
9319142 der handyspielesektor galt lange zeit als ein sehr umsatzkr ftiger markt bisher konnte er sein potenzial aber noch nicht wirklich entfalten
9319143 zun chst einmal k mpft die branche mit dem problem dass es sehr viele unterschiedliche arten von handy games gibt die auf verschiedensten plattformen angeboten werden
9319144 zu diesem vertriebsproblem kommt erschwerend hinzu dass entwickler von handyspielen kein einheitliches interface zur verf gung haben f r das sie spiele entwickeln k nnten
9319145 der durchschnittliche handybesitzer geht nicht auf eine webplattform um sich ein game herunterzuladen die gro e mehrheit nutzt lediglich jene spiele die bereits auf ihren ger ten vorinstalliert sind

9319199 when you ask me those type of questions it really me off
9319200 i remember that it was like the whole world hated me i felt utterly alone i was only 13 and didnt have the where with all to cope
9319201 everyone just stood by and watched many even joined in youre either with the bullies i suppose or against them they were afraid that if they stepped in the bullies would start on them

9319213 i think when it comes to somebody being victimised you are obviously a very good example because we know from research and from anecdotal evidence how childrens concentration goes because all ones cognitive resources are simply going towards how to keep safe
9319214 you probably experienced great tension you probably experienced disturbed sleep the worry of whats happening to them once the bell rings and they are out in the corridor or out in the playground or whatever
9319215 it is so important to dispel the myth that bullying is a normal part of growing up and that its character building it is nothing of the sort

9319225 i know the sikh family very well theyre family friends to hear that their little girl saishaa who is just 2 has cancer just shook me to the core the family wanted me to ask sanjay dutt for help from the charitable institution nargis dutt foundation thats named after his mother since i know sanjay i readily agreed and rang him up
9319226 when he heard the seriousness of the situation he said forget the foundation ill help the girl and he immediately agreed to write out a large sum of money for little saishaas treatment at the tata memorial hospital
9319227 the girls distraught mother harjeet kaur just wept when she heard about sanjays generosity just goes to show the industry has its share of good people and its people like sanjay who make our world a better place

9319232 playing in england has been a lifelong dream which has finally come true by moving to city
9319233 the springboks got into the game they built momentum and we dropped off it and thats what happens at this level
9319234 the springboks are world champions someone has to be bottom of the table it doesnt mean youre not a good side
9319235 weve already seen in this tournament how little it takes to go from being a victor and enjoying the experience to a loser and not enjoying the experience
9319236 i guess whats evident is how much it took us to lift the mandela silverware so weve achieved something and weve got the opportunity to go on and achieve more so well hang on to that
9319237 weve got the opportunity now to regroup and get back and focus on what is a fantastic opportunity in brisbane
9319238 the lady and the tramp com e out and chase me en espa ol
9319239 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9319240 sweet honey heaven cleanses and moisturizes sensitive skin imagine pulling the comb straight out of the hive slathering that divine honey all over then being showered by a delicate spring rain
9319241 she could drag me over the rainbow or send me away
9319242 if you ask us what is a natural resource we would say the land the animals the plants but we have to have an emphasis in ourgeneration on science in order to move on our government is calling it vision 2020 we have a vision for me and my friends here to have a good life and families because we had a generation of division it is a hard goal science is needed to move forward it is the key of our development
9319243 our host families took time to go around searcy and explore with us
9319244 when you go like this with your hand like youre saying goodbye in my county that tells you to come here
9319245 so at first when our friends would say bye and wave we would come back
9319246 i think now that we are in the u s in order to make friends we are going to learn from mistakes and get better
9319247 i really feel like when i see little kids that dont have hair it makes me feel better to be able to give them something that i know they will appreciate
9319248 doing it schoolwide will kind of spread the word about that to others
9319249 im doing it because i want everybody else to give and feel the way that i do after ive done it
9319250 i had grown my hair out and she said mom you ought to do it too so i said ok i will it didnt take much
9319251 shes so passionate about it you cant help but help her
9319252 im pretty impressed with her planning it and trying to encourage others taking time out of her senior year of high school to plan it
9319253 i was never blessed with a lot of basketball talent
9319254 i still see kids from my first couple of jobs that come up to me and call me coach
9319255 i may not remember their names right away but i remember them
9319256 i told kevin that i plan on retiring when weston douglas is 8 and after that hes mine
9319257 weve had a lot of great kids come through here i want to see a kid do well when he gets out of here whether he is an architect or a manual laborer if they want to play at the next level we do everything we can to give them a chance
9319258 ok this lunch box is terrible you need a new one
9319259 this is all broken it couldcut somebody i think weve gotten our moneys worth out of it
9319260 this move will help us continue our toprovide quality care to patients in our area
9319261 we are pleased to offer cancer treatment in white county so that our patients dont have to travel to large institutions for this same care
9319262 i strive to provide high quality compassionate medical care to each individual who comes through our doors i feel it is important to educate patients about their disease so we can make good treatment decisions together
9319263 at our practice we focus on patients not just the disease to serve them in this difficult time in their lives we hope to help patients through all aspects of their care
9319264 we go into the homes and teach the parents how to prepare their child for kindergarten
9319265 i think hippy has given me the help that i need so i can help them
9319266 the best thing is that they give you the instruction you need and everything is mapped out for you day by day my kids will be more than ready for kindergarten
9319267 since we are funded through the arkansas better chance for school success grant the bryant program is for families with low incomes
9319268 they must showproof of income through w 2s pay stubs or other means
9319269 they go into the homes once a month for at least an hour and role play with the parents
9319270 they provide the parents with the free hippy curriculum which includes nine story books then they teach the parents how to teach their children all we ask is that the parent spends 15 minutes a night teaching their child
9319271 at our monthly meetings the parents and children are separated
9319272 the children will do arts and crafts music listen to stories and play on the playground the parents get to meet and interact with each other through different guest speakers and activities
9319273 the income guidelines are higher for families than most people think so anyone that is interested should call the office for those income guidelines
9319274 must contain a concentration of buildings of which at least 51 percent are at least 50 years old and have not suffered extensive alterations
9319275 the arkansas historic preservation program came and surveyed the downtown area and determinedwhich structures were contributing structures
9319276 the next step i took was to go to all the business and building owners in the proposed district and talk to them about being on the national register
9319277 the nomination was presented to the state in the spring and they forwarded it to the national register who put it on the list of national register of historic places the week of july 21 it was officially announced friday aug 1
9319278 since the downtown property is on the national register it does several things for the city of benton mainly it helps preserve bentons history
9319279 it also helps maintain civic pride helps attract heritage tourists which is a big chunk of travel dollars these days and it helps us attract new businesses
9319280 the commission will set up regulations for the district and review applications for building and renovations in the area
9319281 they will issue a certificate of appropriateness before any building permits are sold for construction and renovation
9319282 it took a year for me to draw up the plans then another year to actually complete the job
9319283 people want to come down here now we have more events down here and it has attracted more merchants
9319284 there are definitely fewer empty buildings and now our businesses have curb appeal
9319285 we want to continue to renovate our sidewalks beginning with south street in order to make benton a walkable city
9319286 we are a low crime city so our residents should have smooth sidewalks throughout the city that they can enjoy
9319287 she is an incredible example to me and all youngwomen climbing the corporate ladder she radiates positive energy and enthusiasm into everything she does
9319288 she has a strong work ethic and upholds high moral standards
9319289 the people ive seen get this award in the past i look up to so much
9319290 the more i went and met people the more involved i became
9319291 i am forever grateful to have people like stacey in my life
9319292 you have to make sure everything is done in the proper way with attention to detail it may cost a little more and people may not see the good in it at first but youll appreciate it 20 years from now when all that work pays off
9319293 since i was a kid ive seen the potential in heber springs but ive never seen the leadership needed to make the most of it
9319294 after years serving on the city council we would vote on these things and go about things in a way that didnt make much sense i could see what needed to be done and ijust felt like i needed to step up to the plate since then a lot of very exciting things are happening here
9319295 the sports complex is the one ive spent the most time with on a day to day basis
9319296 i stay right on track with it and i tell the council all the time this is our legacy this is what people will be able to look at in the future to see what we did with our time in office the sports complex and the community center the one im most excited about is the community center when it gets done it will be one of the nicest centers for a community of this size anywhere in the country i think itll be the thing ill be most proud of when its complete
9319297 a lot of people around here will say we have all the amenities we need and all the amenities we want already
9319298 theyre afraid and i am too we dont want to lose our small town charm to growth but the truth is we can grow provide our people with the amenities they need and still maintain that small town charm
9319299 in the past weve grown at will with no rhyme or reason to it
9319300 i want all my employees to know that we work for the people of heber springs
9319301 were not going to have an attitude were here for them and i make sure they remember thats what government does
9319302 its the same thing with being a fireman youre there for people when hey need it the most as mayor you can be there for people too and sometimes they call and are like i hate to even ask you and you have to remind them that thats what youre there for
9319303 my only regret is that i dont have much time anymore for to fish on the little red river
9319304 i dont get to enjoy it like i should we truly are blessed in heber springs if you love nature scenery this is it
9319305 i know that sounds like a sales pitch but we truly are friendly as can be
9319306 yes its demanding and yes its time consuming and i guess like any job its what you make of it but i love doing it and i hope to continue doing it for a few more terms
9319307 in a small town you have a real sense of pride in your community
9319308 thats what motivates me im very proud of my community and its been very good to me ive just had a lot of good experiences here
9319309 some people think thats wrong but thats how i am and im doing it now while i can because i know that some day heber springs will be too big for me to be involved in every little thing like that anymore
9319310 but another fishing guide i know greg willingham was bringing in limit catches of striped bass every day i decided maybe it was time i learned to catch stripers too
9319311 you need to give the stripers some line when they hit
9319312 let em take the bait then set the hook hard
9319313 that was some of the best action for big fish ive ever experienced
9319314 is some hot melted butter to dip the fish in and youve got yourself a great meal that tastes even better than real crab
9319315 ok this lunch box is terrible you need a new one
9319316 this is all broken it could cut somebody i think weve gotten ou r moneys worth out of it
9319317 the cfo part is financial planning and decisionmaking i also have to make recommendations to the ceo and hospital board about financial recommendations but since im the ceo we have to kind of rearrange things
9319318 as ceo i deal more with hospital personnel and now all the staff reports to me instead of just the accounting staff
9319319 there arent really enough hours in the day to do both jobs i just take things as they come
9319320 something has to be done that is why we are going to the voters
9319321 we feel if we would have gone to the voters earlier it would not have beenas urgent now its urgent
9319322 there has always been a perception in the community that the hospital is just a band aid station
9319323 the things and services we offer here are important and our patient care has not been sacrificed
9319324 it has allowed us to take a good look at ourselves but through it all the community has been very supportive
9319325 i think people will think twice before they go somewhere else because now they know what we offer its going to have more of a positive impact than just the sales tax increase
9319326 its great when people send us letters about how happy they were with the service they received here that is one reason we are here
9319327 based on a list of quality indicators that we have to meet every quarter and compared to other hospitals in the state we received the award
9319328 it is something that we are very proud of we have not and will not cut the quality of patient care
9319329 we started with five kids in the church and t wo of them were mine we wanted to get more kids coming so we started the program heaven bound
9319330 now we are in our fifth year and we have about 190 kids in the program
9319331 most of the kids in the program go to magnet cove schools and the teachers said they believe the kids are behaving better
9319332 i want to remain here long term i think its a great place to be and there are great people that work here
9319333 im not balancing all of these things on my ow n i couldnt do any of this without god and my faith he is there to lead and guide me through all of this
9319334 i also have an extraordinary amount of support from my husband and my two girls without all of these things none of this would be possible
9319335 is some hot melted butter to dip the fish in and youve got yourself a great meal that tastes even better than real crab
9319336 but another fishing guide i know greg willingham was bringing in limit catches of striped bass every day i decided maybe it was time i learned to catch stripers too
9319337 you need to give the stripers some line when they hit
9319338 let em take the bait then set the hook hard
9319339 that was some of the best action for big fish ive ever experienced
9319340 hes still influential in congress he still has supporters in congress and in the district

9319345 i wanted our kids to win the game and i felt very confident that we could convert
9319346 duane bennett had his jaw set and he wasnt going to be denied i think it was a tremendous moment for us that we can really build on
9319347 just going through anything like we did last year its kind of like you know what what do we have to lose just go out there and just relax and go have fun catch the ball complete some passes things will take care of themselves
9319348 ive got a tremendous sense of humility because it wasnt easy
9319349 you know what at the end of the day the gophers found a way to win a football game
9319350 we just kept moving it down we felt real good
9319351 it really stings to lose but you havent seen the end of the huskies
9319352 were going to build on this theres a lot of good things to come

9319475 los nietos no tienen la culpa porque realmente son los padres los que tienen que inculcar el amor yo lo que les digo a los padres de los nietos es que recuerden que tambi n nosotros somos seres humanos que tambi n sentimos
9319476 a veces nos dicen que ya no debemos participar y meternos pero a veces tambi n nos piden consejos los nietos y debemos de d rselos por la experiencia que tenemos nosotros
9319477 ahorita no hay muchos valores que digamos se han perdido mucho los valores y se debe a tanta publicidad que hay por ejemplo en el aspecto sexual hay mucha publicidad que si los condones que si hay que estar preparados yo creo que ya todos esos valores se han perdido
9319478 hay much sima gente mayor olvidada yo creo en parte por la falta de valores y tambi n por nuestra forma de vivir entre el tr fico el trabajo los requerimientos para poder estar en un trabajo que cada vez tenemos que trabajar m s y m s pues como que despu s ya no hay tiempo para vivir con la familia todos los viejitos necesitamos dinero para vivir

9319481 falta precisamente que los hijos traten de convivir con los padres para que los nietos los conozcan porque si nunca los traen para convivir con ellos pues no puede haber amor si no hay convivencia no puede haber amor

9319540 in the era when black people in this country were simply struggling for access jesse owens joe louis and jackson robinson emerged they kept their mouths shut didnt raise any issues didnt gloat in any victories didnt seem too sad in public about their defeats even when it was pretty clear that they were ripped off in terms of judges or decisions and they had to do that in order to gain access
9319541 here we are 40 years later and we are once again about to send our young athletes overseas to compete in games while we send our young soldiers overseas to fight in war
9319542 black people really dont have nothing to fight for come back home and we fight for our own freedom and we get our heads beat up i just dont think i should go 10 000 miles from here and shoot some black people that never called me n r never lynched me never put dogs on me never raped my mama enslaved me and deprived me of freedom justice and equality and hes black too i just cant shoot him
9319543 inundate them with opportunities such as coming to events to talk about themselves we need to get them involved almost through threats because otherwise theyre not going to do it they will sit behind what they have which is money but theyre in a situation now where they are so lost
9319544 and athletes nowadays are not willing to make that sacrifice in order to be heard so theyre status quo and thats hurting their surroundings
9319545 its no longer an issue of straightforward segregation but its an issue of a lack of emphasis and government intervention and so forth in communities which have in some instances substantially collapsed institutionally
9319546 the money has become so big the athlete today is literally a walking corporation such as lebron james tiger woods carmello anthony michael jordan and magic johnson
9319547 muhammad ali had a heck of a lot at stake when he took his stand and without question so did bill russell when he supported various organizations civil rights activists and marches
9319548 just as our generation was different than the generation of joe louis jesse owens and jackie robinson the next generation of athletes and leadership to emerge will be different than our generation i just hope that we are smart enough not to fight them and say thats not the way its done because theyre going to do what they have to do within their generational context

9319562 i think that governor palin is a compelling person shes got a great story
9319563 i think you guys can take a look at governor palins and joe bidens record and make your own judgments in terms of who you think has what it takes to be an outstanding vice president
9319564 republicans rightfully have criticized the democratic nominee senator barack obama for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison
9319565 governor palins lack of experience especially in national security and foreign affairs raises immediate questions about how prepared she is to potentially succeed to the presidency

9319568 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

9319570 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9319571 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9319572 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9319573 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9319574 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9319575 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9319576 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9319577 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9319578 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

9319583 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9319584 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9319585 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9319586 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9319587 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9319588 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9319589 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

9319591 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9319592 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9319593 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9319594 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9319595 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9319596 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9319597 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9319598 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9319599 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9319600 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9319601 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9319602 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9319603 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9319604 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9319605 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9319606 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9319607 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9319608 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9319609 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9319610 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9319611 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9319612 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9319613 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9319614 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9319615 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9319616 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9319617 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9319618 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9319619 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9319620 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9319621 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9319622 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9319623 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9319624 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9319625 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9319626 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9319627 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9319628 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9319629 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9319630 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9319631 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9319632 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9319642 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9319643 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9319644 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9319645 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9319646 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9319647 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9319648 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9319649 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9319650 this is a low tech solution and could help all patients with cardiovascular problems
9319651 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9319652 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9319653 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9319654 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9319655 the eu is not in a position to throw russia out from anywhere
9319656 any attempt to isolate russia would not only be short sighted but unrealistic
9319657 now the russians have no rights whatsoever on georgian territory their presence here is illegal and they should leave georgia
9319658 hes still influential in congress he still has supporters in congress and in the district
9319659 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia

9319666 all the negotiating teams are back nothing was achieved in the latest round of engagement in south africa to break the deadlock we remain where we were
9319667 i can confirm that we went to south africa for separate bilateral discussions with the facilitator
9319668 the meeting was convened because the facilitator wanted to search for a way forward
9319669 mugabe is showing no respect for southern african development community sadc no respect for the dialogue
9319670 as far as we are concerned to the extent that the dialogue has not been concluded there is no legitimate government in zimbabwe so he should not go to the un and au posing as the president of zimbabwe we will be taking up this matter with these organizations un and au
9319671 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods
9319672 but their numbers are in lakhs hundreds of thousands and we require more resources more boats army and rescue efforts to evacuate them

9319676 during the last two decades advances in techniques used to identify microorganisms have proven that a large number of unknown communities exist in nature and zodletone spring 30 miles west of anadarko has several unique features perfect for this study
9319677 the spring has high sulfide and sulfur concentrations high levels of gaseous hydrocarbons and an absence of oxygen that makes it ideal to study and hunt for many of these unique bacteria
9319678 because these bacteria come from an environment in which oxygen is rare some sophisticated isolation strategies will be used in the laboratory as we verify their environmental role and avoid the presence of oxygen which can kill them
9319679 our team is very happy to be chosen to receive this grant in a program that approves only 10 percent of the grant proposals that are submitted
9319680 further investigations are needed to sort out effects of radiation and confounders in existing and planned studies of radiation exposed cohorts and new laboratory studies are needed to explore biological mechanisms for low dose radiation related cardiovascular effects
9319681 the low dose radiation effects on cardiovascular disease risk are likely to remain challenging and controversial even more so than the linear no threshold arguments for cancer risk that are debated to this day but should not be dismissed
9319682 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
9319683 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
9319684 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
9319685 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
9319686 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
9319687 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
9319688 this study provides further evidence for darwins theory of natural selection by showing that environmental conditions can directly impact genes controlling physical traits that affect the survival of species
9319689 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
9319690 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
9319691 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
9319692 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
9319693 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
9319694 at the same time we cant talk about the problems weve fixed
9319695 a phone is only as good as the network its on
9319696 so much for a new way of doing business at the old at amp t your fathers phone company
9319697 if consumers are not getting the full 3g experience that is not apples fault
9319698 its hard to launch an iconic device like the iphone on a network that it is not yet fully deployed
9319699 as they build these networks they will need to make more improvements or the complaints will persist
9319700 both companies are accustomed to controlling all aspects of the delivery of its products
9319701 it illustrates the culture clash when you create an environment where you share the responsibilities between them then you have problems
9319702 we dont believe macro or global issues are causing the problems
9319703 we are not going to go into the details of what customers are talking about
9319704 everyone is interested in figuring out if this is an at amp t or an apple issue
9319705 i just want to know who to call to fix it
9319706 they told us theyd rather miss a deadline than have a bad launch
9319707 where are the refunds or maybe toss in a free ring tone and a couple months of free service
9319708 as the market matures every single customer is tougher to get
9319709 regulation of consumer products the bizarre case of strawberry jam and cigarettes
9319710 the establishment of regulation is a political process and occurs slowly however with the gradual but prolonged and massive epidemic of tobacco related diseases regulation of the industrys products specifically the constituents of tobacco smoke has to begin now
9319711 there is no need for an expensive bureaucracy to oversee this regulation countries can simply mandate tobregs recommendations and publicize them as advice from the worlds central public health board countries without cigarette manufacturing facilities can simply refuse to import cigarette that do not meet these standards
9319712 international standards are highly desirable as large amounts of cigarettes are traded between countries with differing national standards it is timely for who to set standards and offer world leadership particularly as their framework convention on tobacco control is now in its implementation process albeit much slower than most public health advocates would desire singapore australia and new zealand are ideally placed to pioneer the introduction of these measures
9319713 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9319714 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9319715 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9319716 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9319717 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
9319718 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
9319719 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
9319720 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
9319721 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
9319722 i feel this issue should be recognised in its true form as i wrote to the prime minister this is not a hindu versus muslim or jammu versus valley issue
9319723 i had asked the prime minister not to surrender to the pressure built by separatists he agreed with this analysis and said in his reply that under no circumstances will he take a decision under pressure of separatists
9319724 not at the moment if required later we will take appropriate action
9319725 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
9319726 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun

9319728 hay avances pero no lo suficientes sobre todo en el tema de judicializaci n donde el proceso est estancado y hay falta de voluntad para continuar las investigaciones de la fiscal a en el tema de reparaciones colectivas solo se ha llegado al 2 de las comunidades se aladas como victimas y el registro nico de v ctimas ruv avanza lentamente
9319729 no exista nada que refiera un cambio en las reacciones del gobierno y de las fuerzas armadas en materia de defensa de los derechos humanos
9319730 yo entiendo que se tengan cr ticas y diferencias con el informe y la cvr pero se debe recordar que existen planes de derechos humanos de reparaciones y que la recomendaciones de la cvr deben ser asumidas como pol ticas de estado
9319731 los fujimoristas son libres de protestar si desean pueden hacerlo cualquier d a ir al monumento y expresar su molestia pero no irrumpir en un homenaje de recuerdo a las v ctimas
9319732 otra vez los vecinos nos dan el ejemplo se debe pedir perd n y reconocer el pasado de lo que ocurri el ejemplo es digno de imitar toda vez que paraguay reci n est terminando el informe de su comisi n de la verdad y aqu es una muestra de como el estado reconoce su error con la sociedad
9319733 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9319734 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly

9319744 die art und weise wie wir gespielt haben schmerzt mehr als die niederlage f r den erfolg muss jede mannschaft hart arbeiten egal ob manchester united oder real madrid das haben wir nicht getan
9319745 das war f r unsere anspr che viel zu wenig
9319746 ganz sicher hatten wir uns den start nicht so vorgestellt
9319747 das ist doch nichts neues f r uns die bundesliga hat in diesem jahr auch durch die aufsteiger noch mehr qualit t
9319748 das ist immer noch zu wenig wir sind zu wenig gef hrlich im spiel nach vorne wir hatten in der ersten halbzeit zu viel angst
9319749 nach einer stunde mit guten fu ball haben wir das spielen eingestellt warum wei ich nicht wir waren zum schluss zu nerv s und zu passiv und haben geradezu um den ausgleich gebettelt da war mehr drin

9319778 do you know if your husband is an organ donor
9319779 i have no idea we never talked about it i would guess no he wasnt but i dont know what his feelings were about that
9319780 oh no no i couldnt do that i know hes dead and cant care but the idea of cutting him up like that im just not comfortable with it no im sorry
9319781 only god knows why that person died then im grateful to that person and pray for the family every day

9319787 we know that one third of the cancer burden could be cured if there were early detection and proper access to medical help
9319788 this is probably one of the most important targets because there is no excuse intravenous morphine is very very cheap so every country in the world can buy that
9319789 ive been here for five years lived in florida for 28 years and ive never seen anything like this before its mindboggling
9319790 thats a big pain in the butt and if it doesnt come its a waste of time but better to be prepared i guess
9319791 its on a rush and as congressman mica said it has to be done
9319792 ive known her since she was a little spitfire and she still is
9319793 she fires people at least once or twice a day
9319794 we have a doctor named jon that used to wear a bowtie every day and she doesnt like him because she had a fever one night at home in portage and he told her she had to come back to the hospital
9319795 i fired katie for three weeks until we got over it
9319796 if she didnt have that type of attitude and spunk sometimes i am pulling my hair out because of the attitude but i dont think she would have made it this far
9319797 to relapse with a third form of cancer is very rare i dont think anyone knew what to make of it
9319798 i think a transplant day for a kid is a day of hope

9319806 eight passengers including two children below the age of two died on the spot while 25 others received multiple injuries
9319807 there has to be an end to criminals and villains and misusers disrespecting us and us having to finance that with hundreds of millions of tax money
9319808 people have lost faith in the state government and their patience is running out
9319809 and how to make it clear to russia that its unilateral approach is dangerous and unacceptable
9319810 reaping the benefits of a stable global order based on agreements that make trade and investment both possible and profitable
9319811 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9319812 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9319813 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9319814 the issue of sanctions is not something we dont care about
9319815 i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there

9319817 a common and unified effort by all of us a european effort of which turkey is an intrinsic part of this will be essential to solve the problem in georgia
9319818 europe if contained to the boundaries as they exist now cannot ever be secure and prosperous anymore with the expanded and expansive polices of the russian federation the domino effect that can can take place if russia is successful in georgia can already be seen now beginning with ukraine and we know that the follow up will not be restricted to that
9319819 i make it very clear turkey totally supports georgias territorial integrity

9319844 me ha molestado que desde mayo mi padre y mi representante hayan intentado renovar mi contrato pero el club pensaba fichar a cristiano ronaldo y no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme
9319845 no fue una ni dos ni tres veces las que mi representante y mi padre fueron al club a renovar han ido m s de mil veces y el club tampoco se interes mucho por mi permanencia no tengo nada contra cristiano me parece un excelente jugador pero tengo mi valor y mi orgullo ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar mi salida es un problema tengo mi orgullo y mi intenci n es salir
9319846 el club dijo que volvieran en septiembre cuando se cierran las negociaciones
9319847 antes pens que estar a diez a os pero no es posible y ahora tengo ganas de salir
9319848 el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie
9319849 quiero aclarar las cosas porque me llaman pesetero y no saben lo que ha pasado verdaderamente llegu al presidente con una propuesta del chelsea me dijo que si la propuesta era buena me dejar a salir estaba seguro de fichar a otro jugador pero ahora como estamos al final y no han fichado a nadie no quieren dejarme salir

9319867 we know theres almost a cyclical nature to crime statistics and even to individual behavior
9319868 are our building administrators being pressured not to call police as often
9319869 we are more openly acknowledging that we have issues that need to be dealt with by the police since ive been working here there has never been a directive to me or the school principals to minimize the involvement of police
9319870 our best safety measure is the voice of students talking to adults
9319871 every time that conversation can be enhanced our schools are safer
9319872 we feel like weve been able to generate some momentum for change
9319873 there are a lot of fights every day at west
9319874 but i just dont get into conflicts so i feel pretty safe
9319875 a lot of the behavior problems start and end on buses
9319876 we want them to feel safe and welcome and let them know there is someone here who has their back
9319877 it can be calm one minute a storm the next
9319878 were bigger than many cities so there will be disturbances
9319879 were not ignoring it were on top of it its something were working on constantly
9319880 overall it is safe but there are certain times and pressure points that raise questions of public safety
9319881 there is an increased security concern at transfer points in the last few years
9319882 i have seen a couple of times people drinking beer out of bags kind of partying
9319883 its a dangerous place to wait theyll be selling drugs prostitution gambling robberies everything
9319884 drug dealing fist fights a lot of things the alcoholics like to hang out because its shady over there
9319885 its become to be known as a place to hang out especially during the school year
9319886 you get all these kids who are just there whenever you have a lot of unsupervised kids in one space things happen
9319887 for the first time ive had a couple of adults express to me concerns about going there
9319888 im telling my son get off a few blocks early dont go all the way to the station
9319889 when school starts things are a little more dangerous kids get restless waiting and its probably not the safest place for a single person late at night
9319890 for years cities madisons size have had this kind of security personnel in public places
9319891 hes always had that somewhere between independence and renegade streak
9319892 you dont have to have gray areas on your principles and values but you have to have some compromising postures in order to achieve a common goal
9319893 quick tempers adventurous spirits and love for the countrys uniform
9319894 at tea break le duc tho mentioned that drv had intended to release admiral mccains son as one of the three pilots freed recently but he had refused
9319895 now it will be very bad for you mac kane

9319898 i am a black criminal and i have performed deeds of an air pirate
9319899 he had to carry a different burden than most of us and he handled it beautifully
9319900 he didnt need any coping mechanism thats just built into him
9319901 hells bells we were having monday night at the movies tuesday night at the movies wednesday night at the movies featuring john mccain
9319902 we only had the facts half right but john said nobody knew the difference
9319903 as good as any preacher that ever stood at a pulpit
9319904 wasnt a turning point in me as to what type of person i am but it was a bit of a turning point in me appreciating the value of serving a cause greater than your self interest
9319905 that if you put your country first that everything will be ok
9319906 people dont remember how ugly the pow mia issue was
9319907 i heard people scream in his face holding him responsible for the deaths of pows
9319908 everyone knows about his temper his inability to get along with people
9319909 only an a would put together a budget like this
9319910 you are or you arent hes a very straight shooter
9319911 theres nothing unbalanced about it it always makes sense it helps him get the job done
9319912 nobodys going to recruit him to be a zen master
9319913 johns performance over 20 years shows a man who people seek out to do business with because they know hes effective
9319914 he always said if the opportunity arises again i would love to try it again
9319915 but it wasnt like a dream he couldnt live without
9319916 he put the campaign on his back and climbed up a mountain alone
9319917 he appears to be something different than what he was
9319918 i dont think you get to be 70 years old and then fundamentally change
9319919 mccains gyrations have more to do with figuring out his own party than anything else hes had to sublimate for obvious reasons
9319920 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
9319921 act might be getting a little tired for a man of my years
9319922 american popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists
9319923 we lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves
9319924 i hope it means ill still put the country first and my party second
9319925 i hope it means that ill still do what i think is right
9319926 we have been eating out less which is why this is so great
9319927 i dont think people are eating out less i think theyre looking for a better value when they go out to eat
9319928 the neighborhood definitely comes out and continues to support us even when times are tougher
9319929 weve been selling a lot more pizzas shared appetizers that kind of thing
9319930 we really try to stay away from anything remotely hitting 20 a plate
9319931 theres a huge hole in our budget because of this and our budget outlook is already so bleak we could put that missing money toward any number of good causes
9319932 i dont know that folks should be especially gleeful in parking ticket revenue dropping
9319933 one way or another weve got to reconcile budget shortfalls eventually all of this surfaces somewhere
9319934 staffing is the key here i dont think its anything were doing that would be intentionally causing this its a matter of workload
9319935 anytime we can get more people out there and do more consistent enforcement thats going to bring the revenues up
9319936 if youre fortunate enough to find a parking spot after circling the block around your house a million times you can be there for more than two hours
9319937 you want to be able to do enforcement well enough so people know that if theyre going to park there they stand a pretty good chance of getting a ticket
9319938 so it is important for us to enforce the two hour zones
9319939 where can i get the best care for the lowest price
9319940 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9319941 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9319942 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9319943 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9319944 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9319945 but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that
9319946 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9319947 it hasnt been positively identified yet but we believe it may have come from the missing aircraft
9319948 flightdeck centre in baulkham hills in sydneys north from wednesday over ibms refusal to negotiate a collective agreement with employees
9319949 airport customers will face flight delays billions of dollars may not be processed for westpac and customs wont be able to keep track of security checks all because ibm refuses to talk to its employees ms mcmanus said
9319950 everyone will be affected by this from qantas passengers whose planes wont be on time to medicare customers whose payments may not go through
9319951 flightdeck centre in baulkham hills in sydneys north from wednesday over ibms refusal to negotiate a collective agreement with employees
9319952 due to the captain being alerted to a vibration in one of the engines
9319953 there was no safety issue at any time and the aircraft continued to frankfurt where it landed without incident
9319954 with what we expect will be a minimum of delay
9319955 there was a problem with engine four and the pilot decided to come into frankfurt to repair the engine
9319956 due to the captain being alerted to a vibration in one of the engines
9319957 i cant say specifically how many people are still stranded in floods
9319958 but their numbers are in lakhs hundreds of thousands and we require more resources more boats army and rescue efforts to evacuate them
9319959 i presented my buffalo to the boatman in exchange for a place in his boat since i dont have any money
9319960 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9319961 that would be one of the biggest mistakes that you could make in your life
9319962 im not going to chance it not with my grandchild
9319963 consult our travel advice and consult the us hurricane centre warnings but most importantly follow advice of local authorities
9319964 as we understand it there are 12 parishes or local areas in louisiana recommending or requiring evacuation
9319965 20 issues of porting c code on the 64 bit platform
9319966 it is not so much the computer manufacturers that want to do as if they sell an easy product it is not so much the managers of software projects that would like to view the programming activity as a simple and predictable one it is not so much our educational institutes that would like to train their students with predictable success it is the comfortable illusion of man as elaborate automata that like a drug seems to have freed its victims from the burden of responsibility accepting programming as a hard intellectual challenge would place the full weight of that burden back upon their shoulders

9319975 they have all resolved as they did back on thursday to return to work tomorrow commencing at first shift monday morning
9319976 we await to see the formal offer for an eba
9319977 it is true to say we reserved all our rights legally and while no final decisions have been taken we would clearly have acted in what we thought were in the best interests of the mastheads and of the business as the situation evolved
9319978 there were no votes taken for anything because there is no formal offer from the company
9319979 we are awaiting a formal offer from the company in writing that we can put to the members for their consideration
9319980 i am someone who is concerned about the quality and diversity of our media market
9319981 no queremos confrontaciones ni pleitos partidistas queremos que todo mundo luche por un m xico mejor eso es lo que la ciudadan a pide fuera la corrupci n fuera la impunidad
9319982 cualquier persona est en condiciones de comprender y asumir que han sido arrebatados il citamente a la persona afectada
9319983 si hubiera tenido alguna otra finalidad razona el ts la reacci n normal ser a la de contactar con su hermana inform ndole lealmente de la existencia de los correos electr nicos
9319984 we want to take what we learned here beyond the site broaden it out on a statewide and regional level so this would be an effective tool or strategy to provide not only habitat but some of the ecological services of flood control
9319985 everything weve seen so far shows that we can reduce erosion and flooding and benefit wildlife both in the river and along the banks
9319986 we will look for opportunities to apply what were learning on the pecatonica elsewhere in wisconsin
9319987 this is one branch of a river that all our organizations feel is still significant as far as providing trout and other aquatic diversity
9319988 its a neat river and it happens to be on conservancy land where we can try these things that you maybe couldnt try on a privately owned piece of land
9319989 right now on the banks along the stream the trees dont allow anything to grow
9319990 sediment sloughs off clouds up all the water and provides no habitat for aquatic animals to grow and live
9319991 but these project sites are taking the storm waters and spreading them out
9319992 the approach we are using here is really a true eco system based approach to restoration we are treating the entire site this is where we want to go in the future for restoration we know that our restorations are much much more successful when we look at the entire project
9319993 in doing so the banks wont be washing away and contributing to downstream sediment
9319994 la situaci n no ha cambiado nada siguen las negociaciones yo sigo con la misma idea de marcharme del real madrid quiero jugar en el chelsea se lo he dicho al presidente directivos mijatovic y al entrenador por en sima vez lo digo ante la prensa todav a el entrenador piensa que me puede recuperar pero mi cabeza est en el chelsea
