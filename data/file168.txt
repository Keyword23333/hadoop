1680103 we are excited to begin this water recycling pilot program with devon energy and look forward to helping conserve vital water resources to produce clean energy
1680104 devon will contract with ecosphere technologies of stuart fla to operate the pilot project in johnson county the project will use a pre treatment process to remove waste constituents before the water is run through a series of membranes to remove salts the process will also treat produced water that is released from the shale with natural gas the recycled water will then be reused to hydraulically fracture the barnett shale formation the water treatment system is projected to produce 75 percent reusable fracture fluid and 25 percent high concentrate and solids the concentrate will be used as a drilling fluid or disposed of in an authorized facility
1680105 advanced drilling and fracturing technology has been critical to making the barnett shale one of the nations top natural gas fields however fresh water used to fracture the shale becomes a waste product when it picks up salt metals and hydrocarbons in the formation oil and gas field waste reduction is a priority at the commission and i commend devon and other operators who continue to seek ways to reduce frac fluid and produced water waste
1680106 the process being tested in this unique pilot program will use a low energy and low cost pre treatment system to remove most of the contaminates before the water is filtered through membranes innovations like this system will help the oil and gas industry to find economical ways to transform a waste product into a reusable fluid

1680128 strategies that are effective for protecting critical business data that reside on servers may not be effective for laptop and desktop computers and vice versa
1680129 protecting data in both places can be complex and challenging but failure to implement a solution that provides a business with total data protection could result in catastrophic data loss and in the worst case may even mean the failure of the business that is why the combined offering of yosemite filekeeper corporate for transparent continuous data protection for the edge of the network and inmage dr scout for well accepted core protection is a powerful solution
1680130 based on the companys flagship dr scout product with technology that combines disaster recovery with cdp and solves other issues such as branch office consolidation the decision to partner with inmage was intuitive
1680131 corporations have seen the need for laptop protection for years but because of the complexity of most laptop protection products they have left it up to the users to copy files to a file share with the simplicity of filekeeper corporate and the combination with dr scout customers can be assured that their information is always protected
1680132 yosemites filekeeper corporate solution is well known for its set it and forget it ease of use for protecting desktops and laptops
1680133 combining this with robust bc dr for production servers and applications will provide customers with unprecedented data protection from the core to the edge of their network as well as a high level of peace of mind

1680173 we were excited to be recommended for government funding for a project targeting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or als more widely known as lou gehrigs disease a devastating disease with significant unmet need potentially adding up to 2 4 million to fund the projects preclinical development costs also research from two of our partnered programs was presented and published this quarter dr robin alis team at university college of london reported promising results in an early stage aav based clinical trial in lebers congenital amaurosis lca an inherited eye disease that impairs vision and eventually causes blindness and was published in the new england journal of medicine dr beverly davidson at university of iowa was recognized in pnas for advances in delivery of small interfering rna to the brain and represents a significant advance in addressing this treatment method in huntingtons disease
1680174 additional studies are underway in order to assess this approach fully but these initial results suggest that aav based delivery of genes in the eye can be accomplished safely and with promise
1680175 these new aav rnai vectors embedded in synthetic micro rna structures retain the efficiency of delivery and biologic efficacy while having a greatly enhanced safety profile
1680176 we believe this new design concept is of great importance to the entire rna therapeutic field and that the use of aav vectors for the delivery of expressed rnai has proven advantages over alternative rnai delivery approaches due to aavs long term expression capabilities stability and safety profile
1680177 these results in huntingtons and in lca continue to support our beliefs that aav delivery holds great promise in the creation of a broad new class of innovative medicines and that targeted genetics is well positioned to participate in this opportunity
1680178 we continue to work diligently with our product development partners to move our programs forward and are keenly focused on initiatives to extend our cash horizon we anticipate reporting data from our phase 1 2 trial of tgaac94 for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis at the american college of rheumatology conference in october and phase 1 data from our partnered heart failure program at the american heart association scientific sessions 2008 conference in november
1680179 this quarter we continued our solid financial and operational performance while making tangible progress that enhances our multi year growth outlook
1680180 our pipeline group secured two major new projects the ruby pipeline and the tgp line 300 expansion which increase our committed backlog to 8 billion a level that is more than two times larger than any time in our 80 year history in e amp p our peoples acquisition is delivering promising new drilling opportunities in the texas gulf coast and the arklatex including the haynesville shale in brazil our bia camarupim project is accelerating with first production now expected in the first quarter of 2009 and our pinauna project remains on schedule with first production expected in late 2009 in short the outlook for our businesses has never been better
1680181 our strong second quarter results were driven by a solid performance by each of our operating units and reflect the value we anticipated when we created our global platform
1680182 based on the strength of our operations our integration successes and the momentum of three consecutive quarters of strong results we have increased the range of our earnings guidance

1680184 this strategic financing agreement reflects the growing value of our proprietary phage display technology and maturing lfrp pipeline
1680185 the net proceeds realized through this financing together with the larger retained interest in our future lfrp revenues resulting from the repurchase of paul royalties interest improve the companys cash position in a challenging financial market and support our ongoing efforts to reduce cash burn
1680186 this is an exciting and unique investment opportunity for cowen healthcare royalty partners
1680187 phage display a proven and powerful drug discovery tool has been leveraged broadly through dyaxs successful licensing and funded research program we believe dyax is well positioned to capture a substantial share of the growing therapeutic antibody market which is translating into more valuable lfrp licensing deals and that the innovative structure of this financing enhances operating flexibility for dyax while affording attractive investment returns
1680188 this is a significant achievement for isolagen and an important step towards bringing the first ever autologous cell therapy product to the market for aesthetic use as the future evolves and current therapies continue to show their age the need for novel skin rejuvenation products becomes evident with these statistically significant results we believe we are now in an excellent strategic position
1680189 these results further support the proof of principle for autologous cell therapy and open the door for further research in aesthetics acne scars burn scars and other clinical applications
1680190 i am excited by these positive study results suggesting a clinical benefit from the isolagen therapy a novel therapy using a persons own cells for the treatment of wrinkles
1680191 i believe the aesthetics community would welcome a new first in class regenerative therapy the results of these pivotal studies will generate even greater interest in the outcome of the ongoing phase ii iii clinical study of isolagen therapy for the treatment of acne scars where there is a significant unmet need
1680192 we are thrilled with the positive results from our pivotal phase iii clinical studies of the isolagen therapy
1680193 we intend to file our biologics license application bla with the fda in early 2009 and continue to progress our ongoing acne trial i want to thank the clinical investigators and congratulate the isolagen team for their exceptional performance and clinical achievement in this groundbreaking pivotal study confirming our belief in this innovative approach to aesthetic skin therapy
1680194 we are excited to have dosed the first patient in defend and look forward to continued patient enrollment in this phase 3 clinical trial the initiation of defend represents the culmination of a methodical dose ranging development plan including the successful outcome from an end of phase 2 meeting at fda we believe otelixizumab has the potential to provide an important new treatment option for patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune type 1 diabetes

1680213 it blows my mind really to see how much kids get away with
1680214 ive seen kids cut up pills like ritalin and anti depressants in the bathroom mix it with their water and take them
1680215 i know a lot of kids drinking vodka in water bottles sipping throughout the day and even offering it to friends while not being quiet about it at all teachers are slack in dealing with this issue they dont seem to want to get involved with something this serious and parents are not fearful enough
1680216 i feel like the security is not being strong enough theyre not doing their best but theyre doing okay for now i guess
1680217 i do remember smelling marijuana in the bathroom and wondering why teachers didnt do anything about it
1680218 unless we have reasonable suspicion we cannot search students for alcohol as they enter the school
1680219 if a students behavior creates reasonable suspicion our principals address the behavior with the student which may include administering an alco strip test and a search of a students backpack and locker if this is done the parents are notified of the action and the behavior that led to this action
1680220 the safe statistics on this issue are alarming and as a school board member im not going to turn my head away from this subject
1680221 one of the objectives of our new strategic plan is to enhance student and staff demonstration of core values and good citizenship in partnership with parents and our community we seek to emphasize the importance of accountable and responsible decision making we realize that our students must be healthy and of sound mind to succeed with their studies
1680222 we have to get more parents involved in their high schoolers lives period
1680223 and we need a youth commission to bring all of the local entities together to tackle some of the social issues related to our children
1680224 this fall safe is launching our caf conversations initiative which is a proven model for fostering dialogue between multigenerational groups adults and kids on important issues like this one we talk a lot about achievement but we do not talk enough about character as a value if we are to discover our values as a community we have to talk

1680256 embora o pin tenha sido elaborado pelo sindicato ele dos auditores fiscais
1680257 o que est em discuss o o ato para formalizar que o auditor fiscaliza em nome do estado e n o em nome de quem exerce a fun o de delegado ou inspetor
1680258 entendemos que as altera es independem da lof porque atualmente esses assuntos est o regulamentados por meio de decreto ou regimento da rfb
1680259 essas medidas contribuiriam para a descentraliza o da carga decis ria deixando o chefe da unidade mais livre para cuidar de assuntos realmente administrativos
1680260 defendemos que sempre que haja a interven o do auditor a notifica o de infra o seja substitu da por um auto de infra o basta mudar o nome do procedimento e incluir a chancela do auditor
1680261 na rfb existem dois cargos o principal que somos n s os auditores e um auxiliar que s o os analistas portanto s o duas carreiras j discutimos esse assunto em v rios momentos com a administra o da rfb e com outros setores do governo todos concordam que s o duas carreiras distintas mas o tema nunca foi levado adiante
1680262 precisamos definir claramente as atribui es de cada cargo e isso s ser poss vel se algu m tiver vontade pol tica para separ los isso um pleito antigo da nossa classe e vai fazer bem para toda a rfb inclusive para os analistas que poder o buscar sua valoriza o mas dentro dos limites constitucionais e respeitando o princ pio do concurso p blico
1680263 a lei n o permite que o detentor de outro cargo que n o o de auditor fiscal participe do processo decis rio a atribui o do analista tribut rio preparat ria do auditor nomear analista em fun o de chefia nos setores onde h atribui o privativa de auditor ilegal
1680264 existem in meras legisla es que definem o auditor fiscal como autoridade isso n o significa rebaixamento de outros cargos mas o reconhecimento das disposi es legais

1680321 the next 10 years in pharmaceutical and biotech development will see a shift from point applications to comprehensive integrated information environments
1680322 conformias pplm solution is positioned to take companies successfully down this journey and the soa architecture is a major set of vertebrae that will provide organizations of the future both structure and flexibility
1680323 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1680324 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
1680325 never have we received such hospitality and such overwhelming enthusiasm for electric vehicles as exhibited by the governor and every single person we met while in kentucky
1680326 seeing such a swift reaction by the kentucky government in favor of zap affirms our belief that the time is now for electric transportation to play a greater role in society we all want to build better transportation and it doesnt matter if you live in kentucky or california the dream is everywhere

1680332 we experienced outstanding test results from our two megawatt stationary battery developed for the aes corporation
1680333 the independent report prepared by kema has validated that our battery did everything that it was designed to do these test results have created a significant amount of interest in our product and its capabilities for solving existing problems in the electric grid particularly as suppliers look for cost effective solutions to their capacity and energy management issues

1680340 revenues grew more than 150 as anticipated due to increased gathering and processing volumes from quicksilver resources and third party producers
1680341 our continued focus on stringent cost control enabled us to fully realize the value from the higher throughput volumes resulting in an increase of more than 160 in net income as a result our distributable cash flow increased to support an additional 11 increase in our quarterly distribution
1680342 efficient execution of all aspects of our development program resulted in a 75 increase in our comparable production volumes versus last year
1680343 we are increasing the value of this production through ongoing cost control which has reduced our unit production costs we believe the combination of these efforts puts quicksilver in the great position of being among the highest growth and lowest cost e amp p companies and that the announced acquisition of the additional fort worth basin properties will further enhance this position and ultimate value for our shareholders

1680386 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1680387 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1680388 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country

1680393 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention
1680394 on all three occasions state and federal courts concluded that medellin suffered no legal harm
1680395 the pangolins were packed and ready for export to china via seaports in sumatra and java
1680396 yet despite legal protection illegal trade continues to push pangolins closer to the brink of extinction with indonesia being the main source of these animals which are destined for china
1680397 the police in indonesia have done an excellent job and should be applauded
1680398 we hope that these criminals are prosecuted to the full extent of the law

1680447 the general take on barack obama is that hes an exciting candidate bright energetic charismatic filled with good ideas and on occasion not afraid to express them but not quite mature enough as a national politician with not much of an experiential record to run on hes certainly a positive fresh new face and will be a force to be reckoned with in 2112 and beyond but probably not this time out unless as the vice presidential nominee on someone elses ticket
1680448 knows what hes doing first he has to get into the white house then he can move on his more enlightened agenda
1680449 look this guy obama is going to eat you for lunch theres no way youre going to beat him by taking the high road and arguing ideas and policies the public wants him and his ideas not you and yours the only way you can beat him is if they dont want him anymore if theyre disenchanted if enough questions are raised about him to make them think twice were going to spend many millions to rebrand mr obama our aim is to draw these undecided voters into the mccain voting column of course but even if they dont come on over well be satisfied if they dont vote or work for obama
1680450 the point is that youre not trying necessarily to get voters to accept everything you say about obama as the truth that would be lovely of course but well be happy if enough of them start to wonder about him have doubts about him and oh boy hes stepping right into our trap by appearing as a flip flopper all his own and in his joke about not looking like other presidents on dollar bills which alludes to the fact that hes african american it was like christmas for us in july and we werent going to send that gift back but run with it all the way to november

1680473 los requisitos que justifican una obligaci n legal de los clubes para liberar a los jugadores sobre la base de la tradici n no se cumplen

1680475 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos

1680477 ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico ser a maravilloso tanto para los jugadores como para los aficionados y el propio deporte

1680484 quick solution to tide us over until new technologies kick in
1680485 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1680486 gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1680487 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1680488 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1680489 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1680490 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1680491 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1680492 during my time as head of french diplomacy we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans
1680493 i was looking at the schedule and noticed that you had a beauty pageant so i encouraged cindy to compete

1680501 uma chave essencial em aveiro assim como o foi em coimbra
1680502 suas qualidade de amor igreja a sua sabedoria intelig ncia e santidade
1680503 uma converg ncia entre a aplica o do conc lio na igreja com o papa paulo vi e as mudan as sociais pol ticas e cultural que decorriam em portugal
1680504 de uma forma muito pr pria nobre e atenta viveu como bispo e servidor da igreja ao mesmo tempo que tinha responsabilidade na igreja em portugal com a sua serenidade lucidez e sabedoria procurou tra ar caminhos novos de equil brio mas tamb m de mudan a e renova o
1680505 e nos caminhos que percorreu percebe se uma influ ncia discreta mas interventiva corajosa e determinada
1680506 percorremos a mem ria viva dos caminhos da diocese que desde 1962 estavam presentes nos dois bispos
1680507 d manuel falou me do amor que tinha pela diocese de aveiro e a alegria que sentia pelo substituto que deus tinha chamado
1680508 que quando lhe tracei o sinal da cruz sentia que estava com ele uma diocese inteira que comungava a ora o e a gratid o
1680509 foi sempre uma presen a de grande dignidade e nobreza
1680510 durante toda a tarde estive com ele senti que apesar de algum sofrimento e da situa o de dor e doen a que eram maiores nestes dias mantinha a serenidade
1680511 todos aprendemos com ele e com o seu testemunho para n s um mestre uma refer ncia e um exemplo
1680512 imprescind vel para uma diocese nova como aveiro guardar a mem ria viva dos bispos que a serviram dedicadamente d manuel sempre disse que queria ser de aveiro para sempre
1680513 our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1680514 during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding
1680515 if anything goes wrong i swear i will kill you
1680516 disturbed to learn that the chinese had refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously
1680517 we have sent in our embassy in beijing to demarche the chinese that is where we go in and say we are concerned about this and we want you to reconsider your actions we would hope that they would change their mind
1680518 part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1680519 targeted video games can help improve the lives of young people with cancer most importantly improve their adherence to their treatment
1680520 theyre kind of a tough group that gets a little bit lost in the system
1680521 thats to be determined the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist
1680522 the north korean leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program
1680523 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list then the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1680524 thats a big negative vote against the yahoo board but it doesnt change anything
1680525 it is a statement that they shouldnt be under any illusion that their support is broad
1680526 the recount somewhat lowers the credibility of the management team
1680527 assuming this was all a mistake it is particularly unfortunate management doesnt have the mandate they appeared to have had
1680528 nothing in this resolution authorizes or supports any claim against the united states
1680529 you cant count up the cost of the system of slavery so you couldnt really pay for it
1680530 our argument is that an apology should stand on its own
1680531 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus
1680532 the russian military are talking of strategic bombers and iskander systems
1680533 probably some actions will be taken albeit without belarus regaining its nuclear status
1680534 ultimately we want the driver to have the final control
1680535 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1680536 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give javier solana a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1680537 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1680538 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1680539 she came back with a pretty funny response that will probably elevate her celebrity status
1680540 we are defending islam and its sanctity this is the country we were raised in why should we stand by while our men are defending the country
1680541 obviously hezbollah has hijacked the government in lebanon and now is in a position to veto decisions
1680542 the right of lebanons people army and resistance to liberate
1680543 of the consequences of destabilizing the very delicate balance that exists in lebanon
1680544 the fragile balance of forces in lebanon is unraveling and the world is playing deaf
1680545 the iranians are on the offensive in lebanon iraq and gaza
1680546 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1680547 issued a decree naming several new officers as the head of the presidential guard the head of the armed forces and the head of the national guard
1680548 these officers three generals refused to accept the presidential decree and are rebelling against the constitutional order
1680549 by his decision to oust the generals he attacked the army had on who reacted by deposing him and in some measure he is reaping the fruits of his bad decisions
1680550 considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9 11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation it isnt hard to imagine such an event being played out in the cyber world
1680551 the facts are there and they tell a story of government incompetence not government malice
1680552 they can keep area 51 a secret thousands of employees d
1680553 can some of you oh so intelligent truthers explain to me how the government will plan a false flag attack that will cripple millions of internet users with some horrible virus
1680554 please explain how the government will enforce said i patriot act
1680555 the same way they enforce copyright laws buy the cooperation of isp
1680556 not necessary make up terrorist cell say you saved america by invading their online privacy everybody bends over like they did for the patriot act and fisa dont even need the terrorist act just say you foiled the attempt
1680557 and simply closing large parts of the infrastructure would suffice
1680558 there is something horribly treasonously wrong with a government by the people for the people that operates by lying to the people
1680559 do you really think countries across the globe are going to let the united states come and arrest people for saying something over the internet
1680560 such an event could come in the form of a major viral attack the hacking of a major citys security or transport systems or some other vital systems or a combination of all of these things considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9 11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation it isnt hard to imagine such an event being played out in the cyber world
1680561 considering the amount of unanswered questions regarding 9 11 and all the indications that it was a covert false flag operation
1680562 theres going to be an i 9 11 event which doesnt necessarily mean an al qaeda attack it means an event where the instability or the insecurity of the internet becomes manifest during a malicious event which then inspires the government into a response
1680563 after one president in the pocket of the oil companies we cant afford another
1680564 remember that when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this
1680565 obama told a crowd at a gym in youngstown ohio
1680566 john mccains taking a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1680567 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it
1680568 people care not only what you say but how you vote
1680569 his schedule hasnt been set for next week let alone next month
1680570 americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1680571 i knew it was safe then and i know its safe now
1680572 my friends the united states navy has sailed ships around the world for more than 50 years with nuclear power plants on them and weve never had a single accident
1680573 safety is always a concern when it comes to power sources but ultimately the perfect shouldnt be the enemy of the good and nuclear power is an important part of john mccains all of the above approach to gaining energy independence
1680574 the fact is we have to drill here and we have to drill now and we have to drill immediately

1680745 we recognise that there are several outside factors that are increasing the demand for run flat tyres such as safety and the need to make vehicles lighter to reduce co2
1680746 we also believe that the use of run flat tyres is contributing to environmental sustainability cars with run flat tyres have no need for a spare tyre from the beginning to the end of the vehicles life
1680747 recent goodyear technology breakthroughs will take the current runonflat technology to a new level
1680748 this must obviously always guarantee the mobility after a tyre failure
1680749 we are working on offering the widest possible range of ems so the question is less run flat or spare wheel but rather which ems is the most valuable for the respective customer and its product
1680750 tyre pressure monitoring systems are already mandatory in the us and might become mandatory in europe as well hydrogen fuel cells and electric vehicles will require a strong integration of runonflat tyres due to the packaging issues of these cars with no space for a spare
1680751 we are convinced that the popularity of run flat tyres will grow
1680752 there are compelling advantages of not needing to carry a spare wheel and tools of knowing that you dont have to stop your car on a highway or a dangerous place to replace a flat out tire of increasing luggage space and reducing the overall weight of your car so our strategy is to improve the performance of run flat tyres and meet the needs of this projected demand
1680753 we already sell a truck tyre called the duraseal it is oe fitment on the renault kerax off road truck this has a gel like material in the belt area that plugs punctures when exposed to air the technology exists but it does have a premium this is meeting the needs of truck operators who are doing a lot of abrasive off road work but for car markets we see runonflat as the best solution

1680772 our demand is that the land allotted to the sri amarnath shrine board should be restored with immediate effect as it amounts to a contempt of court because it was after the jammu and kashmir high court cleared the proposal that the land was allotted and that too after paying a fee of rs 2 45 crore for raising temporary infrastructure to create facilities for the pilgrims this is an attempt to finish off our identity
1680773 the shortfall was more pronounced than expected and reflects growing concerns of weaker consumer confidence
1680774 the 13 decline in july new car registrations reflects the continued deterioration in consumer confidence being experienced across the economy rising fuel and household bills alongside falling house prices are making consumers reluctant to commit to new expenditure
1680775 vehicle manufacturers are doing their bit to support consumers new cars are now 22 more affordable than they were 10 years ago and new technology is delivering more fuel efficient motoring industry needs the support of government in order to encourage the uptake of lower emitting vehicles and ultimately lower the cost of motoring for consumers

1680846 i thought we were good tonight and we certainly did enough to win it
1680847 i dont think it should have gone to penalties to be fair but as we stand now weve gone through the pre season unbeaten outside the penalty shootout and we didnt concede during the 90 minutes tonight so overall it was very good
1680848 when your goalkeepers really the best player on your team you know it hasnt been your best performance but the phoenix just came at us right from the start they were up for it they did a fantastic job and played really good football
1680849 were disappointed obviously we wanted to perform well in front of our home crowd and i certainly think we did that we kept the ball well for large periods of the game weve got no major injuries and we got another 90 minutes under our belts against quality opposition
1680850 their keeper was man of the match and i think that says everything about how we played the game thats football though we went to penalties and penalties are always a bit of a lottery
1680851 im really proud that the team has been able to make the final
1680852 but weve never lost sight of our main focus and everything we have achieved during the pre season has been geared toward august 17 everyone can take a bit of a deep breath now were 10 days away from the main competition starting

1680896 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1680897 we are very shocked and depressed it is very alarming for the family
1680898 her absence has given us great pain for the last five years and we have been looking for her and her children
1680899 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1680900 we are very shocked and depressed it is very alarming for the family
1680901 her absence has given us great pain for the last five years and we have been looking for her and her children
1680902 my sister has been accused of many criminal cases by us officials and her life is in danger she is innocent not a terrorist
1680903 soon after her disappearance we sent applications to all the government authorities including the president the prime minister the senate chairman political leaders and the courts pleading for her safe return but they assured us that she was not in the custody of any agency
1680904 when a foreign journalist pointed out the possibility of the presence of dr aafia in us custody in afghanistan we approached fbi officials to find her whereabouts they assured us that they will look into the matter but they were only misleading us
1680905 aafia was tortured for five years until one day the us authorities announced that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman
1680906 we are receiving threats through phone calls and sms not to discuss or pursue aafias case i do not know the people threatening us
1680907 it is shameful it is a crime committed by the us state department officials it should be condemned widely

1680953 we are in a market where the share prices of junior exploration companies are in a free fall i am confident this trend will reverse and when it does i believe the move to the upside will be rapid the key factors for higher prices will be increasing merger and acquisition activity led by well financed producers higher precious metals prices and a big discovery once investors believe they can make money buying junior explorers such as us gold the share prices should start moving higher i believe this summer represents a great buying opportunity

1680960 there has been a lot written about this coming conflict but it is largely based on rather poor geographic information
1680961 we wanted to give a clear visual guide to what the situation really is
1680962 we have been involved with charities before but this is the first time we have officially approached a charity like this
1680963 we did it because we felt it was a good project which would help a local cause
1680964 we are looking to see how it goes over the next 12 months but we are always looking to help others
1680965 we are very much looking forward to working together as each year we have to raise 1 million to provide the special care to our seriously ill children
1680966 we could not do this without the fantastic donations we receive from the community
1680967 it is well noted we have shown interest we have had discussions with madrid over it and they are ongoing the window is still open and we are still talking to

1680976 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and
1680977 there were many people there its a big surprise people dont like us in
1680978 chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan
1680979 if we win one or two big competitions im sure well have fans all over the world maybe it wont be the same as madrid manchester or milan because our history is not the same and you dont make a history in two three or ten years maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
1680980 since i came to chelsea we have only spent eight million pounds on deco came in before i arrived
1680981 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base
1680982 im delighted to have signed ive been with these players for two years now and the spirit is fantastic

1680985 the crux of the problem is that the misuse of the red cross in video games is not only in contravention of the law it also encourages others to believe that the emblem of the red cross is public property and can be freely used by any organization or indeed for commercial purposes
1680986 the red cross has an even bigger more menacing trademark infringer a little outfit they call somebody should inform the red cross that these guys have been flagrantly using the unique design they created for their logo

1680997 i know and even though i would love to officially land with you i also know how much it means to you that people around you will judge you and when i land with you i want the whole world to know so take as much time as you like
1680998 b b but what if we float away from each other i dont want that to happen i cant expect you to stay forever
1680999 sasha the way things are going i dont think we can actually float away at least i know i cant you see we are like two feathers floating about and bumping into each other from time to time trust me the winds will never push us away from each other
1681000 yes with all my heart i want this i have never felt such an amazing connection with anyone in my life i usually dont use the word amazing too often and this is the perfect moment to use it dan you are amazing truly amazing this is not some kind of attention seeking gimmick or a fling or whatever you want to call it its something beyond words the connection is amazing
1681001 dont ask me what im saying in my native tounge
1681002 its expensive and they dont want to ruin it you can pay 30 for a piece of halibut and you dont want it to turn out bad i really want to see more people have successful seafood meals at home
1681003 a squirt of lemon some good olive oil and crusty bread
1681004 its a fish that deteriorates rapidly check for bright shiny skin and a clean aroma
1681005 you want to buy the seafood that looks the best that day
1681006 if you go to the market and they either dont have what you needed or it just doesnt look fresh then knowing what can sub in the recipe really helps
1681007 one stove four burners one oven regular pots and pans i wasnt about to fill a book with recipes from my archives these were all created specifically for the book in a small basic kitchen
1681008 our children are going to see the collapse of fisheries and this is a call to arms
1681009 all wild fish are going to be commercially extinct and we need to get the message across that theres a problem in the ocean
1681010 the u s west coast salmon fisheries were shut down this year five years too late
1681011 whole foods puts chilean sea bass back in its stores because it has a reliable source but what message does that actually send
1681012 suddenly people think chilean sea bass is universally okay again
1681013 i just came walking down the beach and everyone was looking at it no one knew what it was it kind of looked like a dog but it had this crazy looking beak i mean i would freak out if something like that popped up next to me in the water
1681014 they say an old guy came and carted it away

1681018 during the past few years there has been increasing concern about the exposure of children to obscene and pornographic material via the internet the increase in the use of the internet has raised serious problems concerning the unrestricted access to obscene and pornographic material especially the use by children
1681019 if an adult wishes to have unrestricted access to the internet the service may be obtained from an internet service provider in a password protected manner making a payment however the user is responsible for use of the service in proper manner and the user should ensure that the filtered websites are not accessible to children
1681020 if adults wish to have unrestricted access to the internet services may be obtained from the internet service provider in password protected manner making a payment

1681023 i learned a lot about how you give it music to people how raw you can be and how open and honest you can be in your music
1681024 i want to give them something they can jam to as well the first single off the album will be a little bit more upbeat

1681032 britains second consumer wine magazine livelier than decanter and organisers of the international wine challenge
1681033 much stronger and faster than humans but they had no endurance
1681034 a big male chimp weighs about 50 kilos 110 pounds yet could easily rip the arm off someone
1681035 the australopiths would really excel at gymnastics and diving because of the greater upper body strength longer arms
1681036 their short stature and low body mass would also have greatly increased their ability to do flips and spins because of the low rotational inertia of their body
1681037 australopithecus represented a biped on the ground with much more climbing ability and without striding locomotion
1681038 running would have been possible but probably not as efficient
1681039 most human sports that we value the most with exception of power sports involve this incredible ability to run or do aerobic capacity
1681040 if you compare neanderthals to yourself or most people probably living in mechanized urban areas the neanderthals would appear very strong
1681041 however if you compared them to early modern humans the neanderthals and early humans would not appear very different
1681042 going to the gym going on a bike ride even most olympic training doesnt do the same thing as having the same serious level of lifting walking that people have done in the past
1681043 neanderthals were somewhat shorter and stockier than the average sapiens but there are modern humans with the same proportions
1681044 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1681045 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1681046 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1681047 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1681048 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1681049 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1681050 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1681051 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1681052 another addition to this kit is a special report on ngo activities which is gathered on a regular basis within our crisis communications planning we thought you would find it useful to have a picture of what organisations and media are planning at the one year to go mark and in the coming months within the ngo section you will also see the iocs standard reply letter to organisations that approach us on china related issues
1681053 he cannot and will not support legislation that raises taxes
1681054 more likely to enrich oil companies than to lower gas prices for american consumers
1681055 i think the problem with mccains position is that he keeps saying im in support for all of the above but when it comes down to specifics in what he will really support the only thing that comes through loud and clear is more drilling and i think that is the big vulnerability on his part
1681056 the tax the oil company issue is really difficult for republicans but the polling data indicates that the public thinks the oil companies have big role to play i dont know what is really going on here or if mccain is thinking this through carefully but i think this is undermining his credibility and to some degree is his hallmark approach looking for bipartisan solutions to problems
1681057 in the end he might have to do exactly what obama has done join the compromise while saying he objects sternly to the taxes but even then he risks getting killed by his conservative base
1681058 there you go again thats exactly the politics of division that has led us to where we are in washington
1681059 one of my biggest frustrations with helping college students searching for internships and recent graduates hunting for entry level jobs is that many dont yet know how to network
1681060 it isnt that theyre stupid or lazy they simply havent been taught so how do you get a gen yer who grew up with computers and can hardly remember a time when the internet wasnt at their fingertips how to network one way is to guide them to the best on line tools and remind them to use those tools over and over again and now the hundreds of thousands of college students and recent graduates who use collegerecruiter com each month will have easy access to one of the best on line networking tools linkedin
1681061 the rebates that were receiving from private health funds are not matching the expenses of running and staffing the unit and i suppose bearing in mind that the hospital was sold less than two years ago for being under financial pressure weve got to make some commercial decisions
1681062 with full staffing the new linear accelerator will increase the canberra hospitals capacity to provide radiation oncology services by 30 per cent
1681063 over the past 12 months new patient referrals have increased by about 25 per cent and the average number of patients waiting to commence radiotherapy treatment has increased by about 30 per cent
1681064 since 2005 we have extended the normal hours of operation and improved processes to increase the provision of services but without the new linear accelerator we would not have been able to cope with the increased demand for services
1681065 cancer is a disease of old age and were all going there
1681066 but unfortunately it does seem that the closure was inevitable financially anyway but the patients did get lovely service there because of the quality of the staff and because the numbers of patients were not high
1681067 the closure of the oncology unit at calvary john james hospital is a private sector closure and a decision made by a private company
1681068 we know that microbes can exist quite happily in oxidizing conditions
1681069 the story possibly could turn out to be the same for mars we dont know yet
1681070 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1681071 perchlorate is not a particularly nice thing to find in the soil
1681072 no one hunting for life would be happy to see it in any sort of abundance
1681073 it is not a molecule of choice for most life
1681074 i commend those officers involved in the way they handled this situation
1681075 are in serious risk of being forced out of the market if the current situation continues
1681076 since the start of the liquidity crisis the cost of warehouse funding has increased from 25 to 30 basis points over the bank bill swap rate the reference rate for transactions between the major banks to 120 to 140 basis points over the bank bill swap rate
1681077 this increase cant be absorbed by any financial institution that relies on securitisation for funding and has to be passed on to borrowers it should be noted that the warehouses are provided by major banks in australia and through the pricing of the warehouses they are able to force smaller financial institutions to be uncompetitive
1681078 the under pricing of credit risk and seemingly endless liquidity for housing related securities was a major boost to the non bank mortgage lenders
1681079 because nearly all non bank mortgage lenders had not taken measures to diversify their funding bases the impact of the global liquidity crisis has been damaging to their business model

1681084 listen here in this life you can be oh so smart or oh so pleasant for years i was smart i reccommend pleasant being smart can make you rich and bring respect and reverence but the rewards of being pleasant are far more incandescent
1681085 look out theres some broken glass on the floor there
1681086 hi pleased to meet you my name is lloyd dobler ill get straight to the point wont take too much time from ya im probably the youngest person youll get advice from today and you may think that a guy my age wouldnt have anything to say but its said that observation not old age brings wisdom and i observe every single life lesson im given i wont attempt tell you how to love or be loved because you get a different genie each time that lantern is rubbed but i will offer you advice on dealing with life its ups and its downs its troubles and its strifes now im sure youve had times when youve felt down or angry wanted to lash out punch a wall and be manly but the question i pose now will offer you a plan b and maybe some peace and quiet for your friends and family how hard is it to decide to be in a good mood and then just be in a good mood thats all i have to say because its a straight up fact you control your emotions its as simple as that
1681087 hi my name is billy brown i aint gonna give you some quote instead im gonna use some stuff that you wrote always had the feeling i could never be the villain cause the villain in the books is always backlit always had the feeling i could never be the villain cause the villain in the books is always backlit now i find it pleasing to defend myself with reason but this clock is always sitting on my back tick tick tick then no explosion but participants errosion like a picture over overly exposed and like a fox thats been run over in the road and basically what im trying to say to you is you dont achieve anything by letting the past rule within you getting all pent up and angry about stuff just eats away inside you whats that other line of yours if you cant forgive and forget hows this forget forgivin and just accept that thats it see thats how its gotta be then you can fall in love get on with your life and be free

1681107 contohnya bonsai dengan gaya miring ke kanan akan baik bila diletakkan di sebelah kiri dari pot agar seimbang konsepnya seperti memasukan foto dalam frame dan membuatnya jadi indah untuk dilihat

1681110 theres an irony in that we tend to think that sport should somehow transcend politics but it rarely does
1681111 there were alternative olympics set up in barcelona and they had gotten as far as printing the programs but then the spanish civil war broke out
1681112 the nazis they used those games in order to prove to their own people their international legitimacy
1681113 you may be seeing some parallels with the current games
1681114 there was a nonviolent protest and the government opened fire and killed about 250 people and the international olympic committee said this was a domestic issue and should not be addressed by the olympic movement
1681115 you can shoot down 250 people on the street but dont ruin our medal ceremony
1681116 people are completely oblivious to the fact that people were massacred in the streets of mexico city it shows how images and media can create our perception of a historical event
1681117 however that was an event that created its own history
1681118 if that hadnt happened you wouldnt associate the 1972 games with terrorism
1681119 the beijing olympics mark the moment in human history when china which is farthest from the political centers of the west both culturally and geographically is incorporated into the world system to a degree never seen before
1681120 because of the intense interaction and high level of collaboration with the outside world required to organize the olympic games many chinese people are just now realizing that their old way of doing things did not reach international standards and that they did not understand the west as well as they thought they did
1681121 the impression they make on the rest of the world is secondary
1681122 whats important is to show their own people the 95 percent who arent communists that the rest of the world acknowledges the communist party as the legitimate leader of china
1681123 if the u s president will stand next to their leader thats fine

1681160 lonmins operations have consistently underperformed its own forecasts on expected platinum sales and have been subject to a declining sales and production profile at a time of robust prices
1681161 current guidance of 765 000 to 770 000 ounces of platinum for the year to september 30 2008 is 15 lower than the initial guidance provided for this period of 900 000 ounces and represents the fourth downward revision in this financial year

1681277 the person you are cohabiting with is your lifelong spouse until you have gotten married
1681278 here in a derridian fashion the obstacle is the very opening to that which it blocks by returning to the very thing that they thought was the obstacle to their fulfilment they indirectly find fulfilment a fulfilment without fulfilment an impossible fulfilment while their previous direct attempt to find fulfilment to make it present in its fullness led to nothing but a type of living death
1681279 so what do we learn perhaps we are reminded of the old christian insight that heaven is the impossible that we indirectly glimpse only when we renounce it and put ourselves to the task of utterly offering ourselves to the world
1681280 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
1681281 i feel theres a lot of life to the tracks and a real solid groove things feel tight

1681287 i think its an abomination as far as legislatures are concerned

1681293 you can never promote enough if you are always limited by your resources
1681294 i grew up with the promise that if one wanted to go to space they would get the chance
1681295 it became obvious that the only people that were going to space were government trained employees called astronauts other folks were not getting to go
1681296 the least likely guy was the one who won it this part time barnstorming airmail pilot
1681297 x was for the unknown for experimental for 10 10 million
1681298 the prize would be analogous to the prize that stimulated the aviation industry this prize though would stimulate the personal space industry
1681299 i read through it and i was kinda like hmm
1681300 i gave it a little bit of thought was like gosh you know if it were me id probably just try concrete vibrators
1681301 i was kinda like well gosh this is almost too obvious i struggled with that a little bit but i went ahead and submitted the solution and won
1681302 i was pretty dumbfounded at that point whod have thought
1681303 it could be your inventor next door or your ph d scientist from harvard
1681304 these people love the hunt they sometimes can connect dots that many people cant
1681305 they care about a lot more than just the money they want to be part of a community and they want to do stuff that matters
1681306 we find now organizations are really just beginning to see the power of inviting the outside world into really helping them with their innovation whether its inviting in customers or partners or 7 billion people
1681307 it doesnt replace inside innovation what it does is it provides a very powerful outside mechanism for driving innovation into the organization
1681308 we all hoped that within some years of the ansari x prize being won an industry would start for personal spaceflight i think none of us dreamt that that industry would actually start during the competition
1681309 when i stood there out at the tarmac on mojave and looked at the tail of spaceshipone and there was the logo for a business that had been launched to take paying customers into space it was incredible that this would happen concurrently with the prize and not in the distant future
1681310 openoffice org is considerably more memory hungry than microsoft office
1681311 it also has its own file format odf which microsoft has pledged to support
1681312 the opendocument format odf is a file format for electronic office documents such as spreadsheets charts presentations and word processing documents while the specifications were originally developed by sun the standard was developed by the open office xml technical committee of the organization for the advancement of structured information standards oasis consortium and based on the xml format originally created and implemented by the openoffice org office suite see openoffice org xml as well as a free and open oasis standard it is in its version 1 0 manifestation published as an iso iec international standard iso iec 26300 2006 open document format for office applications opendocument v1 0 2 the opendocument standard meets the common definitions of an open standard meaning the specification is freely available and implementable
1681313 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1681314 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion us dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1681315 freddie macs liquidity position remains strong as a result of its continued access to the debt markets at attractive spreads the companys cash and investments portfolio of approximately 70 billion us dollars and an unencumbered agency mortgage related securities portfolio of approximately 470 billion us dollars which could serve as collateral for additional borrowings
1681316 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1681317 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1681318 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks
1681319 there might be one or two things that havent leaked yet
1681320 no one should even think they know the subject of the talk
1681321 quite frankly all the pieces of this have been staring us in the face for decades and none of us saw it until dan put it all together
1681322 this is the mother lode all right from the point of view of internet criminals looking for easier access to other peoples money and secrets
1681323 people are also happy with dvd because the quality and convenience jump from vhs to dvd was far greater
1681324 the player is here and will remain with the team he will start thursdays game against ivory coast in shanghai from the beginning and im sure he can be with us for the rest of the competition
1681325 not at this time no i have spoken with him and he wants to stay here with the rest of the team
1681326 i hope this decision will not have any effects on other teams with players who are coming to this tournament every coach would want messi in their team hopefully barcelona can take the decision that he stays here
1681327 surprised and disappointed by the cas decision but we respect it
1681328 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympics it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1681329 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1681330 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1681331 we are pleased with the cas decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1681332 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1681333 it is sad for the athletes concerned they were dreaming of the games but obviously there are some issues between the players and the clubs
1681334 there is maybe a lack of clarity about the tournament we will see afterwards how the rules can be worked out
1681335 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1681336 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1681337 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1681338 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1681339 my dog sits near the computer while i do the work for him
1681340 people are also happy with dvd because the quality and convenience jump from vhs to dvd was far greater
1681341 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too
1681342 only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
1681343 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know im like totally ready to lead
1681344 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1681345 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1681346 hes the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket but is he ready to lead
1681347 she got it that the mccain thing was a low blow
1681348 and she felt she didnt want to return it with angry fire and that this was the best way to respond its a playful jab
1681349 shes a lot smarter than people give her credit for
1681350 you can tell our country has its eyes on the prize when paris hilton is getting into one of the most important in years
1681351 i just think mccain is appealing to the lowest basest parts of people in this country its cheap stuff
1681352 for this guy to be putting out campaign ads with paris hilton and britney spears is just absolutely ludicrous and insulting to voters
1681353 i am in the area because my lady is having medical treatment and the school is really close by i happened to pop in and they said you can do something for us
1681354 his wife visits the back clinic over the road which i think is the only one of its kind in the country
1681355 i knew who he was straight away he walked through the door and i said what do you do and he said im tony martin from black sabbath
1681356 dan beehler and myself are not on speaking terms and havent been since 2004
1681357 the new record thrash speed burn was to re establish us as one of the pioneers of speed and thrash metal i guess it was a sort of reminder to younger metal fans where the whole speed thing came from not that we have anything to prove but the intensity of this record is evident and it s honest we always try to get this freight train vibe like in our live performances it was the first time we have recorded in digital but the final product came out sounding garage old school i dont know if thats a good thing or bad thing some reviewers like the production some dont you cant please everyone our new singer kenny winter from brooklyn new york is a great addition to our line up i write the songs for the most part kennys interpretation of the songs has added an exciting fresh angle in the exciter tradition the sales figures for this record since the release date feb 22 2008 are impressive and our record co massacre is quite pleased with the numbers
1681358 i feel the band today is a lot stronger than the 80s
1681359 the writing process kind of happened in 2 phases the first phase i was in australia
1681360 how are we going to get this together what are we going to do
1681361 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1681362 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1681363 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1681364 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1681365 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1681366 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1681367 rory stern powerfully combines a deep sense of compassion for his clients with a dead on focus about resolving their most troubling issues

1681370 7 dirty little secrets you need to know about adhd amp your child
1681371 as we look at the year ahead we anticipate an increasingly difficult economic environment
1681372 the escalating price of energy the contraction of real estate values and liquidity and confidence issues in the finance sector are creating economic shocks that will likely be felt by the vast majority of consumers in the us as well as in europe and maybe elsewhere
1681373 while the us television business and small parts of the other divisions are exposed to the moribund us advertising market larger parts of it are not
1681374 we have a great growing business there but the more i read about investments in russia the less i like the feel of it
1681375 theres enough uncertainty around to put the strength of our balance sheet as our absolutely number one priority
1681376 all sorts of things have happened and now we find ourselves in all sorts of choppy waters

1681396 every day we see how jimis musical legacy continues to transcend generational and cultural boundaries this dvd release reflects the genius of his unifying spirit

1681405 if youre talking about a 40 to 50 an ounce impact it may mean the difference between tropicana getting up and tropicana not getting up
1681406 if were talking about ways and means of improving things that is an incentivised system rather than an early introduction of penalties then i think that is the better way to go
1681407 weve got lots of options in the business in terms of investing across the globe
1681408 and at the moment in australia it is just getting tougher what i am annoyed with is the possibility of copping another 24 million hit when in other countries they wont do the same thing because they know it will destroy their industry
1681409 there is no concern we cannot meet the final 50 million estate property instalment in december we have already realised about 200 million in settlements from sales of estate property assets and have another 170 million to come through
1681410 that cash will be used to retire debt and will also take our gearing lower than the current 45 per cent we pay debt through asset sales of residential apartments not through refinancing
1681411 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for
1681412 an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1681413 while i continue to believe strongly that xstrata offers shareholders enormous potential for further value creation and growth as a stand alone entity our engagement in these discussions clearly demonstrates our willingness to explore dispassionately any proposal that could deliver superior value for our owners

1681429 in recent months we have seen a significant increase in home improvement personal loan requests for the last decade homeowners have been able to sit back and rely on rising property prices to increase the equity in their home but sadly this is no longer possible if you want to trade up and avoid substantially increasing your mortgage youll need to add value to the house youre currently in
1681430 the current cooling of the property market is making homeowners think twice about selling up and many are opting to improve instead in a buoyant market people taking on a home improvement project could get away with less than perfect preparation or some slapdash sums as their mistakes were covered by rising property prices however in todays environment it is vital you plan any project thoroughly to ensure maximum return on investment
1681431 whether the motivation is a quick sale adding long term value or accommodating changing lifestyle needs its vital homeowners consider the financial investment theyre about to make a personal loan can provide a hassle free affordable way of spreading the cost

1681434 the constellation program did conduct a test of the first generation design of the orion parachute assembly system which includes eight parachutes to test that system a mockup of an orion crew exploration vehicle was dropped from a c 17 aircraft 25 000 feet above the yuma proving grounds in arizona on july 31 the test requires 10 additional parachutes to get the mockup out of the plane return the pallet the mockup sits on in the plane to the ground and get the mockup to the correct orientation altitude and speed for the test all but one of the 18 parachutes inflated although all other parts of the test and the system itself performed as intended the parachute responsible for getting the mockup to the correct test conditions called a programmer chute did not inflate during the test as a result the test failed the engineering team will be studying the hardware and the parachutes as well as analyzing computer models and imagery to determine what caused the problem
1681435 all but one of the 18 parachutes inflated 10 to get the mockup in the proper position eight on the mockup

1681447 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees

1681450 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1681451 i just laughed i said seriously you are joking and then he has a go at anthony youre kidding yourself if you take advice off him

1681454 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1681455 i havent been happy at the bulldogs for a while

1681457 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us for five years
1681458 we dont enter these sorts of projects unless we can capture a reasonable share of market and we are looking at mid to high single digits
1681459 despite what you might think we cant get down and dirty with the likes of pure blonde we cant play in that space but there are lots of things we can do
1681460 we have got control over point of sale we have control over floor shelf and fridge space and those are powerful things and in many ways equally as powerful as the other tools available to brand marketers
1681461 if you look around the world the penetration of private label beer is pretty low but given the margins are so high its understandable why they retailers want to go there
1681462 a fair deal for workers and a great tasting coffee for you
1681463 we have done the work in building consumer awareness and i guess its not in rainforest alliances interests to be differentiating that in in the minds of the consumer
1681464 what they have said is factually correct but they have chosen to focus in their marketing on the wages and the deals for the growers and while thats not untrue it is not what their program is about
1681465 we understand they are both working towards the same goals albeit from different directions
1681466 what weve been able to prove with live tv and live sporting events is that the level of engagement of the viewer has a much stronger brand recall and emotional connection than some regular programming
1681467 live sport can deliver more far powerful results for advertisers
1681468 generally the higher rating shows have an older age skew by virtue of the fact that older people watch more tv
1681469 but the olympics engages younger people more than older audiences and the big thing there is that theyre younger viewers very hard to engage full stop
1681470 the cumulative effect is 60 per cent higher for advertiser brands than buying prime time spots alone in non olympic programs
1681471 wed like to think we can share as much insight as possible with our sponsors as to our results but its a bit hard to tell right now
1681472 not going to grow as much as expected but its still going to be growing more than other media

1681475 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1681476 issued a decree naming several new officers as the head of the presidential guard the head of the armed forces and the head of the national guard
1681477 these officers three generals refused to accept the presidential decree and are rebelling against the constitutional order

1681488 your most important appointment today is your appointment with the heavenly father
1681489 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
1681490 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge

1681506 our friends up north microsoft spend over five billion dollars on research and development and all they seem to do is copy google and apple
1681507 a number of commercial firms compete with us using an open source business model by modifying and then distributing open source software to end users at nominal cost and earning revenue on complementary services and products
1681508 to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance our sales revenue and operating margins may decline
1681509 briefing note on the impact of software patents on the software industry in india

1681540 ada tempat tempat ikatan untuk logam logam tersebut pada amiloid beta monomerik yang membentuk ikatan ikatan ditirosin dan menjadi kurang larut jika mereka berkumpul
1681541 pada awalnya kami menganggap pengkelat chelator logam bisa memiliki beberapa kegunaan
1681542 tetapi pengkelat ini juga mengusik berbagai sifat kimia ion logam esensial dan mereka tidak melewati pembatas darah otak dengan baik sehingga tantangan yang ada adalah mencari pengkelat yang kurang kuat

1681590 nargis has shown that if the u s wants to help the burmese people they need to have some kind of relationship with the burmese military government

1681612 in his recent book former white house press secretary scott mcclellan wrote about how washington insiders are more concerned about their image and keeping their jobs than in what is best for the country this past week weve seen the same thing on an international scale the chinese government may build a lavish venue for the olympic games but until it stops censorship it is still a second rate repressive regime

1681638 the turbine would supply clean electricity for us to run our own operations and feed some back into the national grid overall eden would become a net contributor to the national electricity resource

1681646 some of the bridges that will be targeted for improvements
1681647 masshighway has advertised over 86 million in bridge projects in the srpedd region the past two years and our region has done well in comparison to other parts of the state in spite of the shortage of funds
1681648 we have a strong group of 18 teams of inspectors supplemented with six different consultant contractors as needed
1681649 bridge inspection teams examine and analyze every element of a bridge specifically the deck superstructure and substructure assigning each a condition rating on a scale of zero to 9
1681650 its not about all the numbers its about making sure people are safe
1681651 if there are any issues were concerned about we will work on it or well close the bridge
1681652 under the footprint program weve had since 92 weve been able to replace a lot of structures that have become structurally deficient
1681653 in that footprint program we put back something that the functional equivalent of what was there
1681654 facing funding challenges we spent our limited funds to repair the parts of those bridges in most critical need of repair at that time we will continue to maintain and inspect those bridges to ensure their safety
1681655 the accelerated bridge repair program is about reducing the number of structurally deficient bridges at an accelerated pace getting bridges off the list faster than theyre being added
1681656 the emphasis here is preventing a bridge from becoming structurally deficient and fixing the ones that are structurally deficient with the accelerated bridge repair program we want to do that on a faster timeline
1681657 were ready to hit the ground running to get a priority list worked up and get started on repairs and replacements
1681658 it does not raise additional resources to address the extraordinary backlog of projects that we have neglected for decades
1681659 the srpedd commission is not in favor of funding the entire 3 billion bond issue with gans and existing gas tax revenue
1681660 from 2014 to 2030 the payments on the 3 billion bond bill will strip the commonwealth of construction funding needed to continue the effort with increased revenue we can catch up with our bridge maintenance responsibilities with a consistent and steady long term effort rather than a single burst of spending that lasts only eight years
1681661 if they bond all the money they propose to be bonding the long term solution of the governor wont pan out because theyre not raising additional revenue
1681662 with no extra revenue theyre just putting us in more debt as difficult as its going to be the state and federal governments need to provide new transportation resources
1681663 srpedd feels that it is important that the commonwealths metropolitan planning organizations and regional planning agencies with their detailed knowledge of of their respetive regions are able to provide input and be involved in the process of selecting the bridges to be repaired under the program
1681664 masshighway has been reviewing bridge lists with the regional planning agencies regularly since last summer
1681665 we get a lot of impact from the community we frequently have two candidate bridges in the same area and we want to know from the people who live there which one should be done first
1681666 we dont have an advisory role on what bridges are going to get done every year
1681667 they masshighway just tell us which ones to put in our yearly program
1681668 those decisions are all masshighways they manage the bridge program they do the bridge inspections they have the in depth knowledge they dont want regional planners involved in their decisions
1681669 i want michelle obama to not take herself too seriously shed need to know how to take a fierce picture but at the same time be able to eat fried chicken have grease on her fingers and be okay with getting photographed like that too
1681670 just how stupid are we facing the truth about the american voter
1681671 prior to the creation of chicano studies these men were the only visible scholars of mexican descent in the engaged in serious research on the chicano experience
1681672 the origins of student activism among youth of mexican descent in the united states can be traced to 1929 when ernesto galarza then a 24 year old first year graduate student in history at stanford university spoke out in defense of mexican immigrant workers

1681687 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
1681688 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

1681700 the exhibitions will give the local community the opportunity to come and see the threats we are facing from climate change and how a wind farm in the area could help
1681701 it would still spoil the area from what i gather there are a number of errors and the turbines would not save as much co2 as they said
1681702 also the farm would ruin the landscape would not be effective because the wind speeds here are too low and it should not be built in an area of special landscape value

1681704 we are profoundly disappointed that councillors did not take the opportunity to approve our original scheme as they have a lead responsibility in the fight against climate change
1681705 the negative impacts of the proposal were very limited and the potential benefits were considerable
1681706 as a result we have appealed for non determination on the original application but we thought it would be helpful to make a further application with a modified scheme that they may find more acceptable

1681728 i am absolutely delighted the planning committee took the importance of protecting south norfolks landscape into account it is our most priceless asset
1681729 enertrag have completely failed to understand just how deeply attached local villagers are to their own countryside we will fight this appeal with all our vigour
1681730 of course we are delighted the planning committee has voted against this proposal recognising the unsuitability of the site because of unacceptable visual intrusion the appropriate planning policies have been applied with rigour and therefore it is the right result
1681731 we are however mindful of enertrags right of appeal and certainly their normal behaviour to do so we hope that they will give thought to the level of opposition to this proposal and the fact that this is not a suitable site a view that we feel a planning inspector will share
1681732 i was just 16 when i wrote the song i was a bit too young to get involved in all of the meetings and planning so i decided that the best thing i could do was to write a song about how wrong it all was
1681733 they are too big too noisy and far too near all the houses im not against wind power but it has to be in the right place
1681734 no estimates of the visual disamenity costs of electricity generation from renewables fossil fuels or nuclear
1681735 it is not moving as fast as they would like they are robbing peter to pay paul if it is costing 3 5bn to upgrade the national grid why dont they push the nuclear button
1681736 tourism in northumberland depends very much on it being unspoilt country and putting up wind farms will ultimately impact on our ability to attract tourists
1681737 if they are going to have to put up extra pylons to link up these wind farms it is going to have a detrimental effect on the tourism industry in north northumberland because a lot of our industry is based on tourism and a lot of jobs are based on that
1681738 i think bad government energy policy and bad agricultural policy have put farmers in a more beneficial position to let their land to wind farms than grow the food that this country needs
1681739 you dont often see the democratic party the republican party the california league of conservation voters and the chamber of commerce all in opposition
1681740 clearly many of the groups in opposition are groups with an indisputable record of support for renewable energy
1681741 im aware of no renewable energy company or environmental group with a record of involvement in renewable energy who has any support for this initiative
1681742 for reasons that i still dont understand and the campaign has never explained they changed the definition of eligible renewable resource under the california renewable energy mandate
1681743 they added the phrase solar and clean energy which is the initiative brand
1681744 we feel they are flat out lying about some of the provisions
1681745 we think we can plainly show through independent experts that its a lie
1681746 most of the major suppliers dont have time to talk to people who are interested in buying just one turbine
1681747 wind energy is underutilized in southeast michigan were continuing to follow up on this tremendous source of alternative energy
1681748 we know things are looking good we want to do this smart and correctly
1681749 when you are looking at a community to scatter them turbines around would be new age thinking
1681750 they are on the road toward the project but there are spots that could derail it
1681751 there will be people who think these are ugly and the aesthetics are terrible and it will kill birds
1681752 this will definitely be a research project to see why almost all of the computer and human solutions missed this forecast track
1681753 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects

1681770 im still not sold on selling the property for that price
1681771 im not happy with a price that low without an appraisal id rather deal with the developer instead of the middle man

1681830 a lack of tax escrow is part of the fallout of the arm mortgage issue
1681831 in order to afford payments on a property that would be otherwise out of reach thousands of people went into arms inappropriately often these loans were written without the collection of taxes into an escrow account this kept monthly payments low but it also created a massive tax liability that many were unable to pay

1681855 unfortunately in practice it is different with several parties trying to exploit the system and excessive submissions being lodged
1681856 those submitters would have to live in the same district as the application and own land there additionally no organisations or incorporated societies were allowed to make submissions this new approach dramatically reduced the number of submissions
1681857 the environment court process could also be optimised by a more stringent definition of an expert witness and by re defining section 274 of the rma allowing in principle every submitter to join a party to the appeal and be represented including the right to call expert witnesses and present the case
1681858 weve got a ridiculous situation here this is land that was mined for ironsand to a depth of nine metres 30ft in 1973 and yet we were required to pay experts to say whether there are maori artefacts likely to be disturbed by the turbine foundations
1681859 this should be a very simple resource consent because the land has already had industry on it and its for wind energy which the government is encouraging
1681860 everyone must have a right to have their say but the way an organised group of people who dont even live locally can make mass submissions is wrong
1681861 id be horrified if the waverley farm was fast tracked because theres been too little consultation i dont think people had any idea how big the turbines were going to be

1681895 theres as much transparency about the investment portfolio and sevens overall investment strategy as there is on a smoggy beijing day
1681896 seven says it is waiting for the stock market to go lower but in the meantime it seems to be contradicting itself because its heavily invested in a market that is declining

1681913 we cannot be fooled by a government that is pushing through a contraband reform
1681914 when the government acts as it has now without respecting the constitution and the word of the president is the law then an act of tyranny is being committed
1681915 refrain from being influenced by the putschist attitudes of opposition groups

1681939 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1681940 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1681941 we noticed that there were babies that we were drawn to and babies we didnt like each of us had our favorites there was no rhyme or reason for it the babies were only days old and totally helpless and the baby one of us found unattractive another nurse would find adorable so it evened out

1681951 sociologists have largely ignored food until recently because it was seen as just biological something we needed to survive
1681952 but it is very much social when you think about what we eat who we eat it with and where we eat it
1681953 in a town the size of charlottesville you can easily get chinese ethiopian thai and mexican food
1681954 it was just a throwaway line but he questioned how much we would know about a family if we knew how often they ate together

1681964 i was uncertain about what to expect from this course that had been described as a multidisciplinary class aimed at improving the work environment of the hospital
1681965 i was curious and skeptical of how graduate students from other disciplines would envision this project
1681966 we were giving them input on what was working and what was not
1681967 there were an overwhelming number of people we talked with who said the storage room is a definite issue
1681968 every storage room in the hospital is the same and has similar issues its a place that all who work in the unit use and it directly affects patient care
1681969 thats fabulous thats what they will have to do outside academia and the more we can expose them to these opportunities the better they will be equipped to deal with life
1681970 i think the course sets a really strong precedent for this type of class elsewhere at the university
1681971 the biggest success of the class is that we all have a better understanding of working through problems with others from different backgrounds
1681972 i believe this was one of the most rewarding courses i have taken in both undergraduate and graduate school at the university of virginia

1682000 most other studies have analyzed the impact of critics at the aggregate level which can be misleading because it is confounded by the underlying appeal of a film
1682001 this new methodology truly isolates the critics from other factors that account for market performance
1682002 this study makes it clear that critics covering a wide range of products can serve as market gatekeepers and have different types of impact on product performance and these markets likely wouldnt be the same without them
1682003 reviewing the reviewers the impact of individual film critics on box office performance
1682004 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1682005 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential

1682008 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1682009 it was important for us that there be a clear voice speaking out against the chinese governments abuse of human rights
1682010 its so shocking being an american to see the blatant oppression
1682011 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1682012 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1682013 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1682014 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1682015 i understand that about 200 of our athletes received those masks through the national governing body not directly from the u s olympic committee

1682019 there has been nothing violent on any level these are all peaceful protests all of these people say they are not going to let china use the olympics to silence these issues they want brought to life
1682020 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1682021 there is a wall of police and security when youre in these areas inside the olympic village inside tiananmen square so certainly they have brought out all hands on deck for the entire two days as the torch run finishes ultimately to the opening ceremonies on friday

1682039 aw come on we need you to make up the final team member in the touch rugby volleyball hopscotch thursday lunchtime final
1682040 there are many restaurants that offer high end food with a high price tag i wanted a very affordable place short of a turo turo but three or four notches higher quality wise i also want something simple na babalik balikan mo that youll keep coming back to enjoyed family style which is very important
1682041 theres some confusion with many of our patrons they come here expecting it to be more than a carinderia and when they try the food its lutong bahay home cooking the recipes that the grandmothers cooked that have been reinterpreted
1682042 and they say i came all the way from home and your food is good but its not that great but its a work in progress
1682043 were developing our reservations only function room 21 as our chefs table where youve got a choice of four chefs specializing in different cuisines it has its own butler service pantry and restroom that will be our high end space where we have food and wine pairings
1682044 our inflation path may continue to about the same levels since the additional inflation was brought about by the higher food inflation due to the shocks from the typhoons
1682045 t he central bank will have to maintain a tight policy stance the question is how tight
1682046 in our view there is a good chance that the central bank will deliver another 50 basis point hike later this month
1682047 inflation in the philippines has swung higher much more rapidly than other countries in the region but the central bank embarked on its tightening cycle only in june
1682048 we sold to dbp we want to allow dbp to consolidate its ownership in al amanah and rehabilitate the bank
1682049 theres a middle east based group trying to come in as a stockholder but what are being sold are a shares which can be bought only by filipino controlled financial institutions not foreigners
1682050 we still need approval of the sss board were holding just the a shares so thats one of the legal issues were going to resolve
1682051 well try to maximize our revenue but if were not allowed to sell we cant because that will be an illegal transaction
1682052 it is our understanding that we can now directly negotiate with the agencies who now own the al amanah shares
1682053 farmers can never keep up with skyrocketing prices of fuel and fertilizer so they are now depending on buffalo again
1682054 when people saw tractors working all day and buffalo stopping when the sun gets strong they switched to iron buffalo
1682055 but when buffalo leak in the field their waste becomes fertilizer when tractors leak we lose money in fuel waste
1682056 we do not need a survey to determine such situation we all know that fuel prices went up we know there is a problem as inflation had hit 12 2 last month this is being addressed by the government
1682057 we view these with very serious concern that is why the president is hastening the implementation of the national social welfare program so that the government can help the poorest of the poor
1682058 its a challenge to the president and the cabinet and the whole machinery of government survey results are guides but we should not take them ex cathedra as gospel truth
1682059 nevertheless ncr and class abc households also feel the impact of double digit inflation rates about half of them also say that they have been reducing food consumption
1682060 market turnover although still thin compared to the previous years modestly improved despite the lack of aggressive buying
1682061 the market yesterday saw a monstrous rally triggered by the us federal reserve decision to hold interest rate steady causing the dow jones to climb and oil prices to drop
1682062 the market was already doing good most blue chips yesterday moved which meant that the market was already recovering
1682063 although the risks were still present a lot of them such as crude prices have been discounted
1682064 this was a good showing the market moved beyond our resistance expectation and we might see some continuation in buying today

1682069 its a fantastic opportunity for us at a time when a lot of our competitors are scaling down because of difficulties accessing their balance sheet
1682070 last year many private equity players were clamoring for exposure in india and china but it was hard to get in
1682071 now sellers expectations have come down and what theyre asking for is much more reasonable but the private equity and hedge funds have really pulled back and are more cautious
1682072 in the next three years we aim to invest north of a billion dollars in this part of the world if market conditions allow
1682073 were cautious about equity aggressive on mezzanine financing and well take our time during this period of market consolidation to build long term relationships with companies were going to invest with

1682076 this should place the company in a strong position to take advantage of the governments thrust to mandate the increasing use of biofuels for gasoline and diesel engines to cut the countrys dependence on imported oil
1682077 aside from sugarcane and cassava we will also be exploring sweet sorghum and other higher ethanol yielding feedstocks which will make our ethanol production more efficient
1682078 i hope his recovery is good we need him out here he is obviously the best player in the world he builds a lot of excitement around events
1682079 but whether hes here or not i have a job to do and i dont really worry about the impact
1682080 this ones a little more frustrating for me im two time defending champ and not being able to get out there and defend something ive already defended once and cant do it twice its a little bit frustrating
1682081 jack nicklaus didnt play in the open championship either either did arnold palmer or ben hogan so we can list a number of players that werent there the greats of the game it doesnt work like that
1682082 you can only win the tournament you are playing in and you can only beat the field that is there so it is irrelevant at the end of the day who is in the field there will always be somebody missing
1682083 when tiger isnt playing obviously the tv ratings are going to take a hit
1682084 the guys been the face of our tour and hes hard to replace
1682085 tigers got an injury which is going to keep him out for 10 months thats unfortunate but i think its an opportunity for a lot of people to try and take advantage of the world no 1 not being in the golf tournament
1682086 that course certainly gives me a lot of good memories
1682087 obviously those happy memories are here around this golf course and i am very very looking forward to getting out there
1682088 i thought it was in incredible shape today when i went out there
1682089 the rough seems pretty dense pretty thick guys who come out here this week and hit the ball really accurately off the tee are going to be the guys who come out on top at the end of the week
1682090 if you hit it in the rough it is almost impossible to get the ball on to the green from the rough so the guy who drives the ball the straightest here is definitely going to have a huge advantage
1682091 the greens are straight from putt putt minus the swinging logs and clowns mouths
1682092 i have no idea why oakland hills is rated so high
1682093 whats the mystique because ben hogan won the us open there a million years ago and bragged that he finally tamed the monster thats prehistoric
1682094 we believe this rule change is necessary to reinforce the importance of accuracy at the highest levels of the game
1682095 i feel like its more challenging for a player to judge shots out of the first cut of the rough or out of the rough is the ball going to spin how is it going to come out i like that challenge
1682096 they cant keep making golf courses longer because not every course has a 20 million budget to keep it going
1682097 they cant keep us from hitting the ball far because there are enough engineers and r amp d research and development and technology that keep us from getting longer
1682098 if you can limit the amount of spin on the ball and make the guy play from the fairway and hit a more crisp and a better golf shot its probably a good avenue i think its a positive move
1682099 the events of the last five weeks highlight the profound importance of dns to the proper functioning of the internet and the critical role nominum plays in protecting it
1682100 our customers around the world demonstrated an extraordinary commitment and ability to address this problem quickly and efficiently their confidence in nominum built on a long history of stable and predictable software releases allowed them to upgrade rapidly without disrupting their networks or operations

1682109 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1682110 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
1682111 if you can think of an emotion being communicated by the face as a kind of signal you can understand that we can amplify that signal into what was almost a caricature to see if we get the proper effect
1682112 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1682113 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1682114 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance

1682194 these people have supported wymynpriestesses and mincing gay clerics with boyfriends and such for how many years now what makes anyone think that they really are catholic
1682195 well the anglo catholics or failing that some of us catholics will have to go and get the anglicans thats not such a silly idea as it appears on first reading if catholics cared about the anglicans being re united to the church they would make a lot more sacrifices and take real catholicism to them
1682196 we have too many anglicans in the catholic church already they should take greater care to ensure that they are catholics before they receive them into the church

1682203 were going back almost 10 million years before any previously described asian anthropoid
1682204 the new fossils from india are exciting because they show that the anthropoid lineage is much more ancient than we realized
1682205 most of the fossil record of ancient primates is made up of teeth because teeth are easy to preserve and hard
1682206 occasionally we get lucky enough to have a skull to work with but in this case a few teeth is all we have
1682207 from the tooth size and structure we can say something about the animals body weight and diet because teeth have crests that are differentially developed depending on whether they ate primarily insects leaves or fruit

1682222 this is going to be a milestone moment i think in which people not only in the retail business but in the systems security business will be taking a hard look at what can be done to further strengthen network security
1682223 there is no such thing as a hundred percent security but that doesnt mean that we should throw up our hands and say whats the use um we can get a long way by applying appropriate technologies

1682231 there is a crime in this commonwealth we refer to it as parental kidnapping
1682232 were dealing with some who has the ability to lie skillfully
1682233 im not questioning him any further thats who he says he is

1682236 it is good to see that france telecom is able to generate cash flow and a comfortable net income it reassures the market in a difficult economic period
1682237 i think this was a mistake this operation should have been prepared more cautiously it has been handled with a lack of preparation and psychology this is worrying for a company of this size

1682240 harnessing the power of wind to generate electricity will give us the flexibility to shift natural gas away from electricity generation and put it to use as transportation fuel
1682241 most of that electricity comes from gas burned in combined cycle gas turbines at an overall efficiency of up to 60 why in the world would the federal government or anyone else spend billions and billion of dollars on natural gas fueling stations and natural gas vehicles in order to burn the gas with an efficiency of 15 to 20
1682242 he lent his words to someone who had so much to do with giving us another four years of the oil intransigence of the bush administration
1682243 pickens owns more water than any other individual in the u s and is looking to control even more he hopes to sell the water he already has some 65 billion gallons a year to dallas transporting it over 250 miles 11 counties and about 650 tracts of private property so far he has spent 100 million and eight years on his project and still has not found any city in texas willing to buy his water
1682244 i know what people say waters a lot like air
1682245 i feel honored to be able to be here and be a part of this
1682246 and it was with a number of things that cant be corrected on our own jail
1682247 as far as construction utilities and storage of that nature and surveillance cameras we fell way short we have grossly failed
1682248 it is absolutely essential to the administration of justice that a suitable courthouse and jail should be built at every county site in the state and it is within the province of the courts to determine what are necessary public buildings
1682249 once the commissioners voted affirmatively to begin building a new jail they may not ignore or falter in their decision which was properly enacted by majority vote
1682250 im just very thankful i got a good hearing im just going to serve my time and then look forward to coming back in two weeks and playing some good footy
1682251 i think weve been very poorly done by compared to other actions by other players
1682252 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1682253 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1682254 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1682255 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club
1682256 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1682257 the olympic tournament doesnt feature in the official fifa calendar and there is no executive decision by fifa which establishes a right of release for under 23 players for this tournament
1682258 consequently schalke 04 werder bremen and barcelona are not obliged to release the players rafinha diego and messi
1682259 oh schon dunkel drau en dann gehe ich eben morgen joggen
1682260 our trendsetters are very hip and aware but they are far from experts
1682261 our aim was to discover which companies are going beyond the niche market of hard core greenies and winning over the more broadly influential members of this generation
1682262 west harlem action network against poverty or whanap the publication of a resource guide the sharing of a web database and a community supported agriculture project better known as the
1682263 it pushes teachers rushes teachers theres a major investigation going on within the administration we dont know the full story this lack of communication has to stop
1682264 some schools have too much and don t know what to do with it and others dont have enough
1682265 we dig ditches they rounded us up they took us out about five six miles in order for to dig ditches there
1682266 after a year a year and a half they took us and they put us in a big synagogue before they send us over to auschwitz
1682267 they took all my youth they took it away from me
1682268 but as long as the work wasnt done under an imminent threat of physical violence at the point of a gun or the tip of a bayonet the german government will consider that to be quote unquote voluntary
1682269 fai qualche cosa di straordinario di temerario baciala sulla bocca come se fosse la prima volta e sufficiente
1682270 we all have a role we all can make this successful
1682271 understand this we are not going to be dumbing down the curriculum
1682272 the children are going to have to put their shoulders to the wheel but they have to see light at the end of the tunnel
1682273 im really thrilled that its finally happening its been so long
1682274 its very annoying by the time they make a decision on the fast link to pearson maybe i will have had children and they will be too old to bicycle
1682275 the wtr path is part of what is envisioned to be a pan toronto network of off road bike paths were looking to complete that over the next 20 years
1682276 there is such a built up city fabric already so to get this sort of continuous flow through the city is quite a challenge
1682277 i suspect once the southern piece is built youre going to see tens of thousands of cyclists using it its an efficient corridor because its diagonal
1682278 its going to be a few years before thats a reality definitely but thats the big dream
1682279 its all tied up in an environmental assessment process being conducted by go transit that is addressing both go expansion and also the air rail link
1682280 it connects to a lot of different things it will get a lot of use
1682281 theres not going to be a silver bullet to solve the problem so weve got to pursue multiple approaches
1682282 its very important to control the issues down at that scale where everything is happening
1682283 in the real world in the professional world people work on cross professional levels
1682284 we wanted to create an environment that is problem solving that has the students create their own learning experiences outside of the traditional classroom
1682285 i was uncertain about what to expect from this course that had been described as a multidisciplinary class aimed at improving the work environment of the hospital
1682286 i was curious and skeptical of how graduate students from other disciplines would envision this project
1682287 we were giving them input on what was working and what was not
1682288 there were an overwhelming number of people we talked with who said the storage room is a definite issue
1682289 every storage room in the hospital is the same and has similar issues its a place that all who work in the unit use and it directly affects patient care
1682290 thats fabulous thats what they will have to do outside academia and the more we can expose them to these opportunities the better they will be equipped to deal with life
1682291 i think the course sets a really strong precedent for this type of class elsewhere at the university
1682292 the biggest success of the class is that we all have a better understanding of working through problems with others from different backgrounds

1682294 sociologists have largely ignored food until recently because it was seen as just biological something we needed to survive
1682295 but it is very much social when you think about what we eat who we eat it with and where we eat it
1682296 in a town the size of charlottesville you can easily get chinese ethiopian thai and mexican food
1682297 it was just a throwaway line but he questioned how much we would know about a family if we knew how often they ate together
1682298 in the second decade of the twentieth century it was almost impossible to build an airplane in the united states
1682299 when something you own is necessary to the success of a venture even if its contribution is small youll tend to ask for an amount close to the full value of the venture and since everyone in your position also thinks he deserves a huge sum the venture quickly becomes unviable

1682301 were going to shove a bunch of 30 second ads up his expletive on this issue over the course of the campaign
1682302 you see mile after mile after mile of dead and dying trees trying to do wildfire mitigation has tapped all the local and county resources we have done what we can at the state level but they frankly dont have many more dollars to pull from
1682303 at the end of the day thats a drop in the bucket compared to what a catastrophic wildfire stretching across those counties would mean why cant we do a proactive emergency declaration and really leverage the dollars we need at the federal level
1682304 the impact is large for a short amount of time but the benefits really outweigh the temporary inconvenience
1682305 what was done was done without any of our knowledge
1682306 and i have to say that the damage has been done i just hope this doesnt happen to any other district
1682307 in order to implement the commissions recommendation budget cuts were needed in all government ministries
1682308 we are very excited to open another branch of ivolunteer
1682309 in some cases our program is the only connection our seniors have to the outside world
1682310 the main thing is to make contact and develop a relationship
1682311 we let them know that we care about them and are here to help them
1682312 the reason for the program is the application is very technical
1682313 it gives a lot of them a chance to tell their story to someone its an acknowledgement of the harm done
1682314 our main goal is just to get the word out that were offering free legal aid
1682315 we dont want to miss a single person we can help
1682316 we are helping anyone who lives in san diego but we have a list to refer them to if they live in another location

1682321 protecting americas freedoms at home and abroad securing our homeland and defending democracy worldwide
1682322 i am a guardian of freedom and the american way of life
1682323 this phrase defines the honesty and dedication of the marines for their work of protecting the u s a
1682324 men and women to join their organization who are ready to fight for their country and protect their people
1682325 those who have gone before me to defend freedom and democracy around the world
1682326 the military protects your freedom from those who would take it
1682327 i disagree more and more of my freedoms are disappearing through actions initiated by the government that claims to represent me
1682328 i stay very well informed on such matters and i agree many areas of the government have overstepped their constitutional authority and damaged or taken some of your freedoms however the military did not take those illegal actions other areas of the government did
1682329 agreed but earlier you claimed unequivocally that the military protects my freedom you have agreed with my assertion that my freedoms are quickly disappearing therefore i can conclude that the military despite their claims to the contrary is not protecting my freedom the military may not have the authority to counter other rogue elements of the government that threaten my freedom but that fact is irrelevant what is relevant is the fact that my freedom is not being protected and you claim the military is protecting my freedom im not so much upset that the military cant through legal restrictions defend my freedom as i am that they claim they do protect my freedom when the military claims to protect my freedom they do so without listing any qualifiers or exceptions therefore the military and its supporters are promoting a lie
1682330 the military protects and defends the us constitution in obedience to its
1682331 i disagree many areas of the government have damaged taken and continue to threaten my liberties guaranteed under the us constitution you have previously agreed to this claim but the military makes no effort to protect or rectify these abuses it cannot do so because it lacks the legal authority to interfere in the activities of other areas of the government yet the military claims it does protect the us constitution and therefore protects the individuals safeguarded by that document clearly as these examples prove the military does not and can not the military is telling a lie
1682332 in addition the military continues to execute acts of war against other states without the declaration of defending the constitution at the same time it is actively violating it the military may be excused for not having the authority to question or refuse participation in such illegal actions it is in effect impotent but by not having this authority to refuse participation it is clearly unable to take steps that would stop such an action the military claims to defend the constitution without offering any qualifiers or exceptions therefore this unequivocal categorical claim is a lie
1682333 the military protects your freedom when it is legally allowed to do so
1682334 any compromise between good and evil only works to the detriment of the good and to the benefit of the evil
1682335 the real rulers in washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes
1682336 visit lewrockwell com an outstanding and crucially important web site i visit every day
1682337 i came to investigate the american militarys report that violence is falling in baghdad that life in the city is improving that the us surge has transformed the city what i found contradicts all the official reports baghdad is a city where one street is at war with the next where the people are more desparate than ive ever seen them
1682338 you know whats so funny not in a ha ha way is that we created most of the violence there to begin with so this surge should have never had happened
1682339 prove how the american way is killing the spirits of its citizens
1682340 warum sie gest rzt sind wird man wohl nie herausfinden
1682341 die spd wird als st rkste regierungspartei hierf r einen kandidaten nominieren und da gibt es bei uns sozialdemokraten einen grundsatz das erste wort hat der landesvorsitzende
1682342 ich habe fast 19 jahre politische verantwortung getragen als abgeordneter in der ersten freigew hlten volkskammer als oppositionsf hrer im landtag als wirtschaftsminister und zuletzt fast zehn jahre als ministerpr sident
1682343 das ist f r meine jungs das spiel ihres lebens
1682344 dazu ist der unterschied zwischen erster und f nfter liga zu gro
1682345 wir haben uns nat rlich auch zuvor alle spiele des vfb im fernsehen angeschaut etwa die im ui cup gegen ramenskoje oder das testmatch gegen den fc arsenal
1682346 aber als meine spieler die stuttgarter profis wie matthieu delpierre oder mario gomez dann am millerntor erstmals live gesehen haben mussten einige schon schlucken das sind ja ganz sch n gro e kerle
1682347 diese partie ist f r meine jungs nicht etwa das spiel der saison es ist das spiel ihres lebens
1682348 ansonsten ist in l neburg nur kleiner fu ball in der niedersachsenliga vor 300 bis 500 zuschauern angesagt
1682349 ich habe als aktiver noch nicht die ganz gro en summen verdient
1682350 aber es geht mir und meiner familie trotzdem sehr gut
1682351 das ziel dfb pokal war ja bereits durch den halbfinalsieg gegen arminia hannover erreicht
1682352 ich kann ihnen die minutenzahl nicht genau nennen in der die tickets f r das spiel weg waren
1682353 dazu ist der unterschied zwischen erster und f nfter liga zu gro
1682354 ich hoffe nur dass meine spieler die partie eine l ngere zeit offen halten k nnen und nicht bereits nach 15 minuten die k pfe h ngen lassen m ssen
1682355 es ist wichtig sich klarzumachen dass es neben einem selbst auch andere gute leute gibt
1682356 man muss bereit sein zuschauen zu k nnen und selber den mund zu halten auch bei entscheidungen die man selbst f r falsch h lt
1682357 das ist toll herr leibinger wie sie den generationswechsel geschafft haben und ganz nebenbei noch den aufsichtsrat leiten

1682377 en este informe hay acusaciones inaceptables contra responsables pol ticos y militares franceses
1682378 uno se puede cuestionar la objetividad del mandato dado a la comisi n independiente encargada por las autoridades ruandesas de reunir pruebas que muestren la participaci n del estado franc s en el genocidio cometido en ruanda en 1994
1682379 no podemos por supuesto estar sorprendidos por las conclusiones de esta comisi n dado su nombre
1682380 el apoyo franc s fue de naturaleza pol tica militar diplom tica y log stica
1682381 seront mandat s par la justice le plus rapidement possible et leurs conclusions devraient tre connues dans quelques semaines au plus tard

1682386 we are in the presence of a dictatorial government which has given a coup d tat to the constitution
1682387 here we have no constitution no law and the president does exactly what he wants
1682388 their object is to intimidate the armed forces and the people
1682389 we didnt have even one meeting with the government to speak about this new law it was drafted without consulting any of the important players in the food industry
1682390 this is the governments latest attempt to create a communal economic model that works which is a key item in ch vezs socialist agenda
1682391 everything is related to this upcoming election and its hard to imagine he doesnt see this as important in his efforts to keep power
1682392 the fox gazed at the little prince for a long time
1682393 but i have not much time i have friends to discover and a great many things to understand
1682394 men have no more time to understand anything they buy things all ready made at the shops but there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship and so men have no friends any more if you want a friend tame me
1682395 first you will sit down at a little distance from me like that in the grass i shall look at you out of the corner of my eye and you will say nothing words are the source of misunderstandings but you will sit a little closer to me every day
1682396 it would have been better to come back at the same hour
1682397 if for example you come at four oclock in the afternoon then at three oclock i shall begin to be happy i shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances at four oclock i shall already be worrying and jumping about i shall show you how happy i am but if you come at just any time i shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you one must observe the proper rites
1682398 they are what make one day different from other days one hour from other hours there is a rite for example among my hunters every thursday they dance with the village girls so thursday is a wonderful day for me i can take a walk as far as the vineyards but if the hunters danced at just any time every day would be like every other day and i should never have any vacation at all
1682399 i never wished you any sort of harm but you wanted me to tame you
1682400 go and look again at the roses you will understand now that yours is unique in all the world then come back to say goodbye to me and i will make you a present of a secret

1682406 el torneo ol mpico de f tbol no figura en el calendario oficial de la fifa y no hay una decisi n del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca una obligaci n de poner a disposici n de las selecciones a jugadores menores de 23 a os para este campeonato
1682407 en consecuencia el schalke 04 el werder bremen y el fc barcelona no tienen obligaci n de liberar a rafinha diego y messi
1682408 sin embargo esta decisi n no afecta la elegibilidad de los jugadores que fueron ingresados de forma v lida por sus comit s ol mpicos nacionales y que permanecen seleccionables para competir en los juegos de pek n 2008
1682409 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos no obstante pedimos a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico
1682410 la postura de la fifa no ha cambiado los torneos ol mpicos representan una oportunidad nica para un jugador la de recabar experiencia internacional muy til en el futuro
1682411 hemos llevado a cabo esta acci n para subrayar la utilizaci n de estos juegos por las autoridades chinas como un instrumento de propaganda as camuflan su balance sobre los derechos humanos

1682420 en realidad la gente religiosa har que su sociedad sea un lugar mejor
1682421 pero tambi n son una oportunidad para decir al pueblo chino que respetamos sus tradiciones y respetamos su historia
1682422 deben permitir que las personas puedan expresar sus opiniones y en la medida en que la gente no pueda hacerlo y no pueda tener una actividad religiosa libremente eso es un error
1682423 estoy preocupado por el historial de corea del norte en materia de derechos humanos estoy preocupado por sus actividades de enriquecimiento de uranio as como por sus ensayos nucleares y su proliferaci n y sus programas de misiles bal sticos

1682437 i assumed blogging and social media were for pimply faced kids with too much time on their hands but i was desperate and decided to jump in and learn
1682438 for the short term thinker i believe that the concept of social media as it relates to small business success can be a very difficult one to grasp i know from my own experience when i reached my seventh or eighth month of blogging i was frustrated by my perceived lack of progress i was ready to give up
1682439 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash
1682440 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1682441 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1682442 it is possible to question the objectivity of the mandate of this independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities to gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1682443 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1682444 we continue to place our relationship with rwanda within this forward looking perspective
1682445 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1682446 did we for example systematically take the side of one camp against another hutu against tutsi that is an untruth
1682447 did we fail to denounce the genocide committed by hutu extremists starting in april 1994 that is an untruth
1682448 did we remain passive when the rest of the international community was taking action that is an untruth
1682449 during my time as head of french diplomacy from april 1993 to may 1995 we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans
1682450 there is a legal complication as the father is alone and indian adoption law says a single male cant adopt a girl
1682451 yamada went to the local passport office he was told to go to the japanese embassy which asked him to get a document from an indian court to get custody of the child
1682452 i spoke to him today he cant plan anything till the babys passport is made
1682453 the surrogacy doesnt matter he is after all the biological father
1682454 the baby is alright but the grandmother is very tense
1682455 with india emerging as a destination for surrogate pregnancies a law to regulate surrogacy will have to be brought into effect
1682456 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1682457 issued a decree naming several new officers as the head of the presidential guard the head of the armed forces and the head of the national guard
1682458 these officers three generals refused to accept the presidential decree and are rebelling against the constitutional order
1682459 by his decision to oust the generals he attacked the army had on who reacted by deposing him and in some measure he is reaping the fruits of his bad decisions
1682460 its kind of like saying theres a bunch of money on the street
1682461 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1682462 i didnt like the impersonal nature of such a transaction
1682463 i am trying to recreate a system in which you have a bunch of different animals in a pasture
1682464 all input that goes into the animals is purchased right here
1682465 weve been able to produce food for a lot of people at a low cost
1682466 my whole interest is in health but it is more than just health of an individual

1682468 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them

1682470 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1682471 gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1682472 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1682473 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1682474 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1682475 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1682476 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1682477 during my time as head of french diplomacy we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1682481 maintenant que les jeux olympiques sont l cest une chance de montrer ce que les tib tains ressentent et quels sont leurs espoirs

1682485 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1682486 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1682487 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us
1682488 its been a goofy thing to do at the end of the day when you get home from work and you just want to talk to somebody in your dogs voice and say hey how was your day
1682489 my dog sits near the computer while i do the work for him

1682493 the president of the division bmw motion hendrik von kuenheim is convinced that we must make a scooter therefore we are working on the project
1682494 at helly hansen were confident we have the best performing base layers
1682495 this confidence comes from 40 years of experience producing base layers and enjoying a dominant market share position in many countries we know that once consumers try our base layers they feel the difference it makes the key is convincing them to give it a try
1682496 we have not played earlier in hyderabad except for a friendly against malaysia last month and so we are not familiar with the conditions here moreover there was no big crowd to support us we dont have the home advantage
1682497 delhi would have been a better place we are familiar with the ground ambedkar stadium there and we got lots of crowd support in the nehru cup last year
1682498 we are playing three matches in five days and players are not having much time to rest i dont know why the afc is having this schedule this is not done in other important international tournaments like the recent euro championships we need to assess on this aspect

1682510 were going to have to get used to living with high oil prices
1682511 production in australia is declining so were becoming increasingly vulnerable to increasing oil prices
1682512 if inpex decides its coming here wed be scratching our heads and that doesnt include the bechtel stage 2 development mr ohanlon said
1682513 misrepresented the science of climate change by outright denial of the evidence that greenhouse gases are driving climate change
1682514 with three crisis looming over us oil shortages and rising oil prices planet threatening climate change and a global economic crash there probably has never been a more important time to see this film
1682515 not only does the film reveal the danger of peak oil it shows alternatives that are not just theories but are being put into practice in a country where the environment and peoples needs come before profit
1682516 whats with cowards who cant organize a non destructive strike and why days to exams
1682517 at any given time roughly 800 chinese state owned or state controlled corporations are operating in africa with chinas export import bank funding more than 300 projects in at least 36 countries
1682518 newfound interest in substantial international commerce with africa home to 300 million of the globes poorest people and the worlds most formidable development challenge presents a significant and in modern times rare opportunity for growth job creation and the reduction of poverty on the sub saharan continent
1682519 there to get what they need to feed the machine
1682520 while flat footed western governments largely watch from the sidelines cash flush chinese firms many with state directed financing are cutting deals at a dizzying pace securing supplies of oil copper timber natural gas zinc cobalt iron you name it
1682521 we want to assure the public that this scheme never put any patrons or the public in danger and this amounted to a system where a single employee had decided to help a group of players cheat at the table games
1682522 we will be pushing for full prosecution of all those involved in this theft
1682523 we are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified
1682524 i got here at around 8am and there were three police cars
1682525 i heard from other people that a pregnant woman had been pushed on to the track after she asked the men to stop smoking
1682526 tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime
1682527 ah the great judea christian values that western liberals and neo conservatives keep harping on about fix your own country first you fools
1682528 we are appalled by this incident and hope the perpetrators are quickly identified
1682529 what did she do to you other than asking you to stop smoking
1682530 vendors who need to sell are gradually adjusting to the market and lowering their expectations
1682531 while prices clearly eased during the month the average was skewed slightly by a package of 87 apartments going unconditional during the month and reducing the overall average
1682532 there is a lot of rental stock available and some vendors may be choosing to let their properties rather than sell on the current market but they need to understand that they may not be able to get as much rent as they had anticipated
1682533 the african union condemns the coup detat and demands the restoration of constitutional legality
1682534 to assess the situation on the ground and to assist in promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis
1682535 the rss has been banned three times in the past and i do not think the demand to ban it again is unjustified
1682536 the effects of these major job losses will be felt mostly by the workers and their families many of whom have had financial worries since the pfizer sell off announcement last year
1682537 now these workers many of whom were employees of pharmacia amp upjohn and before that gaeleo face the prospect of seeking employment in a declining jobs market it is a bleak day on the jobs front for cork
1682538 a very disturbing film has appeared on the internet close observation of the film and of the facts seems to suggest that this is not an elaborate hoax but depicts something that really occurred
1682539 we encourage everyone to make personal acts of reparation during the next days for all of the outrages against the blessed sacrament around the world rosaries visits to catholic churches and any sacrifices we can offer are all suitable
1682540 please also pray for the conversion of the culprits that they will answer gods call to repentance and open their hearts to receive his forgiveness
1682541 i am not contrite i will not repent and im certainly not going to apologise for tossing a cracker in the garbage
1682542 i pierced it with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash
1682543 the catholic church forfeits all rights to respect for its ludicrous beliefs including transubstantiation while its anti condom campaign in africa results in tens of thousands of deaths
1682544 our exposure is across the uk and while 20 percent of our business is to banks it is mainly in the retail area rather than in investment banking
1682545 our customers such as national grid and network rail remain robust
1682546 we believe deregulation in france and germany is a massive opportunity for growth
1682547 with 80 percent of net income profit coming from temporary placements and much of the business delivered under managed solution rpo contracts or long term project management contracts spring is well positioned to weather a slowdwon
1682548 it is important for this great country to open itself to the gospel
1682549 its a sign of the times when even the most experienced top tier banks are having difficulty in getting success in an industry they already know so well
1682550 this kind of knowledge gives you an appreciation of how to look for opportunities to make money when you trade be it physical or the paper
1682551 you can be more durable if you take the time to learn the whole business or at least participate in it at some level because if you dont you will fall like sand
1682552 because of the current credit constraints banks are forced to change their strategy by putting more focus on businesses or regions which are more established
1682553 families still want to eat out but clearly they have a less money in their pockets and are searching for value

1682561 palanichamy and malarvizhis son g sivabalan is still under the custody of the minister in spite of a clear deposition in the high court and we have now sought the intervention of the state human rights commission to set him at liberty immediately
1682562 raja is holding on to my son only because the minister hopes sivabalan will make a statement in favour of the ministers attempt to grab our ancestral property
1682563 anybody can use my name and accuse me of anything because i am a public figure that doesnt mean the charges are true
1682564 we are against the entry of illegals from bangladesh but harassment of genuine citizens in the name of deportation cannot be accepted
1682565 we are against the entry of illegal migrants from bangladesh but harassment of genuine citizens in the name of detection and deportation of such migrants cannot be accepted
1682566 we are against providing shelter to any illegal migrant from bangladesh but any action such as pushing back or deportation must be carried out within the existing legal framework
1682567 the older i get the more i realize the importance of a good name
1682568 a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches

1682570 one was 12 only one out of the three had a father so at 4 30 in the afternoon they were roaming around looking around for excitement
1682571 then they found someone had left the back door unlocked
1682572 they poured cooking oil on it and made a slide out of it they were very creative you see
1682573 this time we will fight decisively to achieve our ends
1682574 the nwfp government has deceived us by launching the military operation and we will avenge it for this it is following washingtons policies but we will continue to fight against united states both in pakistan and afghanistan
1682575 they are in the mountains and they are in the villages among the civilian population
1682576 the military is using gunship helicopters to flush them away but sometimes it kills more civilians than the taliban
1682577 it creates resentment among the local population and the government should consider this issue seriously
1682578 i fail to understand how you can sign peace with a group that is adamant on bringing destruction to the region and its people
1682579 we are virtually at the brink of a civil war
1682580 it the military fails to curb militancy then i fear people themselves will fight for their survival they have no other choice
1682581 the lord is coming america is doomed the wrath of god abides upon the children of disobedience his wrath appears in the form of these god smacks that are going on all around us

1682583 lo que se advierte es que no van a necesitar a todos los trabajadores que salieron pero esperamos que los sigan vinculando
1682584 la primera es que de manera irresponsable rcn no tom la precauci n de tapar los rostros de quienes hicieron parte del operativo poniendo en peligro a los oficiales y suboficiales que participaron en el rescate y lo otro es que indujeron al presidente a mentir
1682585 l presidente s lo habla en la noche y le pregunta a ngrid si se hab an usado logos y ella dice que no
1682586 lo que est claro es que este gobierno le tuerce el pescuezo a la realidad y la verdad completa sobre la operaci n jaque a n no la sabemos
1682587 con este video se abre camino la hip tesis del periodista suizo de que esta fue una operaci n muy rara una operaci n en la que se usan s mbolos internacionales violando tratados internacionales un hecho muy grave porque se trata de un organismo cicr del que hasta los guerreros m s fieros aceptaban una intervenci n
1682588 es muy positivo nos revivi la alegr a del d a de la liberaci n tambi n lo es apreciar la consagraci n el ingenio la capacidad de los militares para adelantar una operaci n que se pensaba imposible lamentablemente todos esos valores tan positivos resultan ensombrecidos

1682594 estamos cerca a la quebrada la guayabala y eso tambi n nos tiene preocupados
1682595 los habitantes se comprometen a evitar el paso de veh culos pesados porque la soluci n temporal solo permite circulaci n de veh culos livianos
1682596 como no se les hab a cumplido con el arriendo a estas familias el simpad se comprometi a pag rselos con retroactividad
1682597 en ese tiempo me tocaba liquidar 200 pesos que para la poca era mucha plata pero bueno ah voy
1682598 por lo general me tocaba por las noches y antes eran muy oscuras pero yo me las arreglaba para conseguir la liquidaci n y me quedara alguito
1682599 era muy chistoso porque iba el taxi m o en la mitad de como cinco o seis patrullas de carros y de motos pero no solo ha sido eso tambi n le hice carreras a leonel lvarez y faustino asprilla
1682600 recuerdo la vez que me encontr una persona a quien le acababan de robar todo le hab an dado escopolamina y despu s le quitaron hasta la ropa yo la recog y la llev para donde un amigo le consegu ropa zapatos y algo de comer despu s la llev a la casa porque me dijo que se sent a mejor para m eso es lo mejor y lo m s duro que me ha tocado en esta profesi n
1682601 hemos demostrado que con la campa a que adelantamos de cultura ciudadana se han logrado reducir los ndices de mortalidad en accidentes de tr nsito y por eso queremos que los taxistas tambi n est n en la misma l nea
1682602 hacemos un llamado a que la administraci n municipal observe el esfuerzo que hacemos para mejorar el tema de la movilidad y la seguridad de los ciudadanos que utilizan el servicio
1682603 yo llevo manejando m s de 30 a os taxi empec en un pontiac 54 circulando por las noches y lo que uno aprende m s es ayudar a la gente que se encuentra en la calle
1682604 norm has always campaigned hard for re election and is running once again on his record of service for his district
1682605 congressman dicks has had a long standing policy of scheduling a mutually agreed upon joint appearance with his opponent before the general election and we expect to continue that this year he looks forward to running on his record of accomplishments for his constituents in the upcoming primary election and in november
1682606 wake forest has an up and coming team i like their style of play and they play in one of the best conferences in the county

1682608 we are working with a number of departments on a response
1682609 there is going to be increased focus on the rights of website owners and their right to prevent material being used to the advantage of their competitors

1682611 he got me to the ground and seeking to jar the camera loose from my hand was hitting me and not finding success he put his knee in my throat and was choking me
1682612 at this point i began to yell for help and for someone to call the police
1682613 pfupajena is obviously has something to hide for him to have reacted so violently this abortionist is a danger to the public and should have his license revoked
1682614 the record results achieved in the second quarter continue the upward momentum that aecon has established over the last two years
1682615 and our record backlog is a strong positive signal that the best is yet to come for aecon
1682616 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
1682617 these results reflect superior efforts achieved by all employees to continuously improve our operations
1682618 despite a weaker economy and a high canadian dollar our three divisions increased their sales during the first quarter and more importantly all generated a positive net income
1682619 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business
1682620 wireless saw improvements in financial and operating metrics in the quarter including the highest level of postpaid net activations since the fourth quarter of 2005 significant growth in total net activations improvements in churn cost of acquisition and postpaid average revenue per unit and double digit growth in operating revenue and ebitda
1682621 disappointed with our high speed internet business this quarter but we are taking action to improve performance in the second half of the year

1682642 one of freddys big criteria is playing on a winning team that has a chance to play into october
1682643 that is what replay is going to be there for and replay is coming very soon i cant give you a date but its going to be this year
1682644 there are a lot of factors in replay that i could go on and on about there are a lot of ballparks that are not umpire friendly when it comes to border calls thats how they build them theyre fan friendly and they dont want to change that
1682645 do we like that no but you know what were losing that war so well accept it and well move on and deal with however major league baseball wants us to deal with it and thats about all i can say about it but victorinos line drive is a perfect example of why they want replay
1682646 i look at it now and it looks like it just went foul just missed the pole foul ball after talking to the guys nobody was 100 percent sure one way or the other were not going to flip a call unless weve got it 100 percent
1682647 he goes i dont know i think you missed it but i dont know and he was the closest guy to it
1682648 from a technical standpoint why wouldnt we want to get the play right it seems like we were kind of behind the times and everybody knew what the call was except for the four guys umpires on the field
1682649 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1682650 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1682651 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1682652 weve done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record on tibet
1682653 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1682654 shes at an age where she is thinking with her head not just her heart

1682765 people are going crazy because blackrock is not redeeming as much as eaton vance and others in the market
1682766 i think its very fair to say that many of the parties including issuers are frustrated
1682767 while weve accomplished a lot we still have a ways to go were frustrated that we havent made more progress

1682770 days before the olympic games begin and as all eyes turn to china we appeal to the world to remember that millions of tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom
1682771 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1682772 are real estate guys so theyre looking at the value of the real estate holdings and seeing where its appropriate to sell to get the best value of the real estate while continuing to run retail stores
1682773 the building offers several options it will require someone that has the vision to work in this market and see the various advantages
1682774 if they charge for it they are going to make millions and millions of dollars
1682775 most of us cannot be away from the internet or our laptops for very long we get separation anxiety when we are not on the internet for a few hours
1682776 we like to take one step at a time rather than making sweeping pronouncements
1682777 first we want to make it work on these transcontinental flights
1682778 we are connected to two of the largest airlines in the world
1682779 thats as a proof point and we will basically be first to market
1682780 realistically the small chance we have of progressing means we must score first
1682781 at the same time weve got to make sure we put in a disciplined performance because they are a top european side
1682782 if we go out there charging around and rushing for goals we could be punished we need to make sure its a controlled performance but we know that if we are to progress we have to score first
1682783 these are games you dream of when you play football
1682784 its a big chance for us its a tall order we know that but we are all looking forward to the game and hopefully well give a good account of ourselves and the league of ireland
1682785 its a different level the movement the space they create for themselves is hard to deal with they keep the ball on the deck and you learn a lot from the game they are a top side id say they would be the best side ive come up against in my career
1682786 i think its going to be difficult but percentage wise its hard to judge
1682787 we all know its going to be tough and the conditions will be completely different from dublin as it will be very very warm what we hope to do is to keep the game as tight as we can and you will always get chances in football
1682788 i dont really worry about what other people say but i do think it is a little bit disrespectful for dynamo to think that they are already in the third round
1682789 anything can happen in football as the past has shown
1682790 today marks another important step forward for the executive we have said since the restoration of devolution that we would make victims and survivors a priority for this administration
1682791 we hope that this document will help to move us on the road to making a real difference to the lives of those who have been most affected by the events here over the last 40 years
1682792 we want to ensure that future support and services are shaped by victims and survivors it is important that everyone with an interest in victims and survivors issues read this draft document carefully and gives us their views
1682793 louis said that in all the years of him doing auditions he has never seen talent like it

1682795 mensen die roepen dat de christenen praatjes beginnen te krijgen vind ik bange mensen
1682796 ik vond dat zon zwaarwegende beslissing niet buiten de ministerraad om kon worden genomen en dat vond het hele kabinet met mij
1682797 veel van de tegengeluiden gingen niet zozeer over wat wij als christenunie zeiden als wel over de uitgangspunten die men erachter vermoedde
1682798 er klonk ook in door de christenunie mag haar opvatting over dit onderwerp eigenlijk niet inbrengen want die is gebaseerd op de bijbel en daar heeft de rest van de wereld niets mee te maken
1682799 mensen maken te weinig onderscheid tussen geloofsovertuigingen en politieke opvattingen ik ben aanspreekbaar op mijn politieke opvattingen je bent ondemocratisch bezig als je bepaalde mensen van het debat wilt uitsluiten als je zegt alles goed en wel maar alsjeblieft niet de christenen of alsjeblieft niet de moslims het is een bange en intolerante houding mensen die naar aanleiding van het embryodebat riepen dat de christenen praatjes begonnen te krijgen vind ik bange mensen
1682800 ik weet niet of dat in algemene zin zo is maar in het debat over embryoselectie vond ik de grens tussen libertijns en anti religieus soms flinterdun in bepaalde stukken in met name uw krant in cartoons en op televisie kwam een anti religieus sentiment tevoorschijn waarvan ik dacht wat s dit
1682801 als je je beroept op de universele verklaring van de rechten van de mens en van mening bent dat die niet ter discussie gesteld mag worden dan is dat net zo goed een dogma ieder mens houdt zich uiteindelijk ergens aan vast je kunt op het niveau van overtuigingen heel moeilijk een politiek debat voeren maar het biedt wel inzicht in hoe mensen in het leven staan ik laat mijn geloof niet op mijn nachtkastje liggen als ik naar den haag ga
1682802 geloof is niet irrationeel maar bovenrationeel het is een andere vorm van kennis van wetenschap een andere manier van zeker weten welk verschil maakt het wat betreft de politieke overtuigingskracht of je gelooft dat de wereld door de schepper geschapen is of dat er een oerknal was we nemen dat aan op gezag van anderen ik doe het op basis van een boek anderen op basis van wat ze uit de krant of de wetenschap leren
1682803 als wij aan de rem trekken is dat om echt belangrijke zaken oud minister els borst van d66 zei in een gesprek met uw krant dat wij als kleine christelijke partij niet zo hoog van de toren moeten blazen maar met permissie was d66 niet de partij die een kabinetscrisis veroorzaakte over de gekozen burgemeester iets waar de rest van nederland niet op zat te wachten dan vind ik dit toch wel van een ander kaliber ik ben ervan overtuigd dat de christenunie sprak voor een heleboel mensen ook niet christenen die grote aarzelingen hebben bij de voortgang van de medische technologie we hebben een stem gegeven aan een breed gevoel
1682804 dat mag hij vinden de sgp kiest nu voor het eerst echt voor de oppositie dat zal wel met onze positie te maken hebben
1682805 daar weet ik niets van maar ik vond het raar dat van der vlies zijn conclusie al had getrokken voordat het kabinet een oplossing had gevonden bovendien ik ben de politiek ingegaan om overtuigingen om te zetten in realiteit en dat kan in de regering beter dan daarbuiten ook de sgp heeft in 2003 onderhandeld over regeringsdeelname als dat gelukt was had van der vlies in dezelfde positie gezeten als wij nu want hij had het sgp verkiezingsprogramma nooit integraal in het regeerakkoord gekregen
1682806 er is nu een overload aan informatie lang niet ieder kind kan daarmee overweg dat leidt tot stress uit een recent tno onderzoek over het almaar groeiende beroep van de jeugd op hulp blijkt dat veel jongeren het gevoel hebben dat ze heel veel m ten als je ook ziet hoe ze bezig zijn ze maken al telefonerend een werkstuk op de computer waarop ze dan ook nog met drie of vier mensen aan het msnen zijn
1682807 de overheid kan ouders niet voorschrijven hoe ze hun kinderen moeten opvoeden ik constateer alleen in navolging van deskundigen dat de problemen van de jeugd hier deels mee te maken hebben veel ouders kennen de wereld van hun kinderen slecht als zij advies of ondersteuning willen hebben dan moet er een adres zijn waar ze zich kunnen vervoegen dat zijn de centra voor jeugd en gezin
1682808 we moeten eerst meer informatie inwinnen we weten nog niet goed genoeg waarom precies de vraag om hulp zo enorm toeneemt we labelen meer een kind dat vroeger gewoon erg druk was heeft nu adhd maar ik vind dat er te makkelijk over medicalisering wordt gesproken dat veronderstelt dat we onnodige zorg leveren daar ben ik niet van overtuigd wel vraag ik me af of we altijd de juiste soort zorg leveren
1682809 waar baseert u dat nou op berust zon beeld niet op een vooroordeel in mijn gezinsnota van komend najaar geven we ons juist rekenschap van de feiten het gros van de mensen leeft nog steeds in een gezin maar de samenstelling taakverdeling en omvang van het gezin veranderen daar houden we rekening mee dit kabinet wil de arbeidsdeelname vergroten met name van vrouwen maar nederlanders hechten er ook aan om een deel van hun tijd aan de kinderzorg te besteden dus moet je ook vaders de mogelijkheid geven om minder te werken bijvoorbeeld door het ouderschapsverlof te moderniseren ik wil het voor vaders aantrekkelijker maken om verlof op te nemen met name in het eerste jaar na de geboorte van hun kind
1682810 dat kan ook nog steeds wij handhaven slechts uit een zeer sociaal motief de winkeltijdenwet die eind jaren negentig door d66 en vvd gemaakt is een aantal gemeenten verklaart nu ten onrechte hun hele grondgebied tot toeristisch gebied zodat de winkels op elke zondag open kunnen daardoor hebben kleine winkeliers helemaal geen vrij meer dat willen wij niet
1682811 dat is wel een aandachtspunt ja maar niet meer dan toen ik fractievoorzitter was
1682812 tot nu toe wel ik ben daar nooit krampachtig dogmatisch in geweest en zeker als minister vind ik dat ik bereikbaar moet zijn maar op zondag draag ik mijn blackberry niet bij me mijn kinderen gaan erin mee dat de zondag bij ons niet een dag als alle andere is we beleven die dag samen ik lees wel mn kranten maar de loodgieterstassen blijven dicht
1682813 ja zowel thuis als op kantoor is er altijd n in de buurt bij het geloof in god is het als bij elke andere relatie je onderhoudt hem door met elkaar te spreken in de geloofsrelatie doe je dat door bidden en bijbellezen
1682814 meerdere keren per dag soms heel gericht soms spontaan soms komt het er minder van er zit geen voorgeschreven ritme in
1682815 wij gingen naar de christelijke gereformeerde kerk in hilversum dat heet een zware kerk te zijn maar ik heb me er altijd thuis gevoeld
1682816 de politiek is geen instrument om mijn geloof te verbreiden dan had ik zendeling moeten worden maar ik ben christen waar ik ook ben wat ik ook doe ik spreek liever over getuigen dan over evangeliseren mijn bijdrage aan het debat over de embryowet in 2001 ben ik begonnen met een verwijzing naar psalm 139 een heel mooie psalm die begint met het wonder van het nieuwe leven dat in de moederschoot geweven wordt dat deed ik niet om zo mijn tegenstanders te overtuigen maar om iets van mijn diepste motieven te laten zien en het grappige was dat het heel goed werd aangevoeld door de toenmalige woordvoerders van vvd en d66 dat had ze geraakt ze vroegen zelfs om de teksten
1682817 zeker wel maar het beginsel van scheiding van kerk en staat wil niet zeggen dat er ondoordringbare schotten tussen beide staan wat is er mis met betrokkenheid van gelovigen bij de overheid zo is het goed gebruik dat er in de kerken wordt gebeden voor de overheid en dat hangt niet af van welk kabinet er zit de overheid is boven ons gesteld en in de christelijke gemeenschap zit een geweldige loyaliteit
1682818 ik zet dat niet zo tegenover elkaar ik ben een gelovig politicus pluriformiteit is de realiteit in debatten over godsdienstvrijheid heb ik recht tegenover liberalen gestaan die daarin allerlei beperkingen wilden aanbrengen godsdienstvrijheid is er voor iedereen je kunt niet zeggen dat je moeite hebt met bepaalde elementen van de islam en daarom voor de aanhangers van die religie de godsdienstvrijheid wilt inperken
1682819 het aanvaarden van pluriformiteit is voor mij inherent aan christelijke politiek het feit dat niet alle mensen hetzelfde denken is een basaal gegeven humanisten vinden dat christenen hun geloof in de politiek zouden moeten relativeren maar zij hebben k hun diepste overtuigingen hun levensbeschouwelijke uitgangspunten die zij niet willen opgeven zij baseren zich bijvoorbeeld op de universele mensenrechten en zeggen dat degenen die dat niet doen het niet hebben begrepen humanisten en liberalen zeggen redeneren vanuit het geloof is achterlijk uitgaan van de menselijke rede klinkt heel logisch maar beargumenteer het maar eens een mooie illustratie is het debat over de doodstraf waar ik overigens tegen ben als een humanist consequent is zegt hij ik verwerp de doodstraf principieel maar ik vind dat voorstanders van de doodstraf net zo gelijk hebben als ik maar dat zul je ze niet snel horen zeggen
1682820 nee ik gebruik die woorden graag in discussies over tolerantie
1682821 ik voel me als politicus niet voortdurend aangevallen op mijn geloof ik ben niet naar den haag gekomen om over mijn geloof te spreken embryoselectie komt in de bijbel niet voor voor mijn visie daarop ben ik als christen politicus zelf verantwoordelijk het is mijn vertaling van de bijbelse uitgangspunten over leven en dood ik heb niet het vanzelfsprekende gelijk van de bijbel en zal ook nooit zeggen dat het verkiezingsprogramma van de christenunie h t bijbelse geluid is dat zou zeer pretentieus zijn
1682822 het is te vroeg om de balans op te maken maar ik hou wel de vinger aan de pols wat doet de christenunie met de macht en wat doet de macht met ons een van mijn doelstellingen is dat wij onszelf blijven dat we niet mee doen aan spelletjes als men na vier jaar regeren zegt de christenunie heeft het machtsspel goed leren spelen dan heb ik gefaald ik wil onze idealen hoog houden
1682823 wat een rol speelt is dat er in parlementaire debatten vaak bewust bepaalde beelden in stand worden gehouden dat het kabinet de winkeltijdenwet zou aanscherpen dat de centra voor jeugd en gezin een bureaucratische moloch kunnen worden die beelden kloppen niet maar als kabinet komen wij daar met onze resultaten kennelijk niet overheen ik wil me daar deze zomer verder in verdiepen we moeten het vertrouwen van mensen zien terug te winnen we doen dit niet voor onszelf we doen dit voor het land
1682824 wish you were the ones to come up with the idea for a 1000 iphone app that stupid rich people will buy as a status symbol
1682825 we should ensure all these people be evacuated to safe places in order to guarantee the peoples lives
1682826 medical matters are personal and private we are not putting out a statement the prince continues with his engagements as normal
1682827 its become an open secret within the medical community that philip has prostate cancer
1682828 if hed had a serious chest infection that was so worrying it required hospitalization he wouldnt have walked in and out of there smiling and been sitting up in bed replying to letters
1682829 a hardened deportation regime is not going to make for practical purposes a difference on the street
1682830 it has no deterrent effect the chance of capture the chance of incarceration the chance of dying on the street is a condition of employment for a street gang member
1682831 a lot of people have this misconception its a full stop weve exported our problem back to the source country it doesnt really work that way
1682832 the security agents of the basep presidential security battalion came to our home around 9 20 local time and took away my father
1682833 days before the olympic games begin and as all eyes turn to china we appeal to the world to remember that millions of tibetans are crying out for human rights and freedom
1682834 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1682835 canadians for the most part place importance on education skill modesty and politeness
1682836 on being introduced the customary greetings are firm handshake customary hello or bonjour in quebec
1682837 most canadian gestures are the same as those used in the united states
1682838 to call someone to you use the entire hand rather than the index finger
1682839 the president and secretary of state receive a much more detailed briefing
1682840 police and public security officials were braced for the worst in ottawa during the presidents visit but in the end the demonstrations were modest in size although at times violent
1682841 the belly dancers against bush were nowhere to be seen they do tend to be more active in the summer for obvious reasons
1682842 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1682843 gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1682844 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1682845 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1682846 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1682847 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1682848 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1682849 during my time as head of french diplomacy we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans

1683082 ive never in my life said i didnt want to have children ive always wanted to have children and i would never give up that experience for a career
1683083 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues its very disturbing to see this
1683084 ive always found it strange when people ask how come you know these people do you want to be them
1683085 i dont understand how anybody hasnt at some stage had something to do with villains and what is a villain
1683086 i once worked with a chap who had murdered people and you know he was a good man
1683087 we have filed our revised draft red herring prospectus drhp with securities and exchange board of india
1683088 i have good credit now and i am 25 years old i co signed on a rental note for a dozer and basically the dozer got sunk in a pond the insurance while it was being repaired did not cover down time its rental bill is 28 000 i do not have the money to make monthly payments or pay this do you know how bad this will effect my credit will they take my credit card back that i already have i know it will screw me in the long run just wondering how bad if u have a answer to my problem please help me understand better
1683089 if she was 50 years old id run all sorts of tests but in her state there isnt a lot i can do
1683090 lets just put her in a room and let her die
1683091 there are different types of missions world wide from madagascar to illinois
1683092 our purpose is to invite others to come unto christ by helping them receive the restored gospel through faith in jesus christ and his atonement
1683093 it is true that youngs rhetoric during a time of war was part of the backdrop against which the massacre happened
1683094 no faith believing mormon could ever acknowledge brigham youngs complicity in the massacre and no gentile could think otherwise
1683095 we are going to bearguing about the details for another 151 years
1683096 a systematic effort to cover up and destroy records diaries and court records of the day
1683097 we have got to give a lot of credit to the lds church for stepping up and owning the mountain meadows massacre
1683098 this is something that has been swept under the rug denied and hidden for 151 years this book represents a real paradigm shift and thats remarkable
1683099 we came up with the idea for the book ourselves we were not assigned to do it
1683100 we sought the cooperation of church leaders to get access to information such as the first presidencys confidential collection but asked that we retain full editorial control and theyve honored that
1683101 the trio of authors has properly tagged direct responsibility for the massacre on local church leaders and nauvoo legion officers with southern paiutes playing a minor role
1683102 i give credit to the authors for this somewhat nontraditional view as well as their willingness to rescue the reputation of the victims from the appalling vilification thats taken place for 150 years they have also identified the impact of gov brigham youngs overheated rhetoric and provocative actions in helping to create a violent atmosphere in utah leading up to the massacre
1683103 make obsolete previous studies and without doubt will constitute the necessary starting point for all future ones
1683104 our marching orders as i understood them were to find the truth and tell it thats what we have tried to do
1683105 my feeling is the best approach is to face it
1683106 i was going to be a big pop act that was my first band then i added jazz
1683107 that what i am is an american folk singer i connect to that part of the community
1683108 i feel a responsibility to the community i belong to to provide a picture frame for our cultural family i have found that i can be a voice for the western pioneer experience
1683109 how family faith and ancestors connect us to each other
1683110 my dad marvin was a folk singer who made a living walking door to door with a guitar on his back with albums to sell he was the stereotypical artist as the servant of the kingdom being a folk musician cost my dad a lot but he had deep spiritual ideas that he was doing what he came here to do to say there were times when we lived in abject poverty is too strong but not too strong
1683111 he didnt encourage us to follow musical pursuits i actually trained as a schoolteacher and worked at that for 11 years
1683112 music kept knocking on the door and couldnt be ignored that i turned to it
1683113 its the album that people have been coming up after the shows and asking for
1683114 and when people first see it they think wow thats a lot of music but 11 tracks are stories 13 tracks are songs
1683115 my live show depends on the stories behind the songs
1683116 i just dont want people to think that this is some low quality production
1683117 a show that you can laugh with cry with and feel all of those emotions that people associate with really good drama
1683118 weve been searching for fabrics and materials literally for years
1683119 whenever were at a place where there are fabrics on sale and we see something or find a pattern that works weve bought it
1683120 book of mormon in hand to point out everything that doesnt coincide with the scripture im sure there will be people who come who think its blasphemy
1683121 theres a whole boat thats being built onstage in one scene
1683122 that when a song comes along the emotion is so heightened that theres no other way for them to express themselves
1683123 theres a lot of bright colors theres a lot of movement onstage
1683124 the music is one of the first things that just sucks people in
1683125 what i love about it is that each of the characters is human
1683126 we see how they feel about being brought out of israel and more or less forced to marry lehis sons
1683127 the fish is completely unaware of the microchip the only thing they notice is the anaesthetic and this wears off quickly
1683128 no existe una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa

1683135 las cosas pueden cambiar de un d a para otro pero en este momento la nica certeza es que tengo contrato con el valencia
1683136 es triste para los deportistas ten an el sue o de participar en unos juegos ol mpicos y ahora su sue o no podr hacerse realidad
1683137 amaya evoluciona positivamente y si lo viera conveniente y todo siguiera como hasta ahora podr a ser titular ante china de todas formas depende de varios factores
1683138 la preparaci n se ha desarrollado seg n los planes previstos y eso nos hace ser optimistas por lo menos sobre el trabajo que hemos hecho y estar con la conciencia tranquila hemos hecho todo lo que hemos podido para que el equipo llegue lo mejor posible los torneos y partidos que hemos hecho bajo el punto de vista deportivo han sido muy buenos
1683139 el equipo ha hecho la tarea que deb a y conf a en sus posibilidades viene con todo el respeto pero sin suelo ni techo sabiendo que cada uno de los rivales es dif cil
1683140 vamos a ver lo que nos depara la competici n
1683141 hemos hablado de cantidades de voluntades es un asunto nica y exclusivamente entre el jugador y nosotros el jugador quiere quedarse en valencia y nosotros queremos que se quede
1683142 si estamos hablando de cantidades es porque estamos intentando acercar posturas estamos m s cerca que antes de la reuni n porque deseamos que se quede en valencia se quede contento

1683167 the under realisation on fuel sales in 2007 08 when indian basket averaged 79 25 per barrel was over rs 77 000 crore so there is no question of a downward revision now

1683172 the preachers it appears are far more successful in their efforts to obtain disciples the surprising confidence and zeal with which promulgate their creed the exciting topics of the speedy coming of the saviour and his personal millennial reign the attractiveness to many minds of the idea of an infallible church relying on its evidences and its guidance upon revelations made personally by its rules these with other influences have combined to give the mormon movement a position and importance with the working classes which perhaps should draw to it much more than it has yet received of the attention of our public teachers

1683188 il non aver differenziato i centri di entrata rispetto a quelli di spesa con laggravante dei trasferimenti statali legati alla spesa storica e non ai costi standard ha determinato non solo unesplosione della spesa pubblica ma anche il venir meno della trasparenza della resposanbilizzazione di chi amministra e del controllo democratico da parte dei cittadini sui propri amministratori nonch un aumento dellevasione fiscale con il modello di federalismo fiscale che io ho proposto e la conseguente autonomia impositiva dei comuni degli enti locali e delle regioni tutto questo non potr pi accadere non solo perch il popolo potr controllare il sindaco e gli altri amministratori su come vengono utilizzati i suoi soldi e per il livello di prestazioni che viene offerto ma anche perch sar proprio il sindaco che pu ben controllare i cittadini di cui conosce benissimo i livelli di vita il primo ad essere interessato a fargli pagare il giusto delle tasse e una volta emerso il nero locale da questa emersione ne trarranno beneficio anche a livello regionale e nazionale per cui questo mio modello di fedralismo fiscale far s che a pagare le tasse saranno veramente tutti e che quindi tutti ne pagheranno di meno

1683228 the delay is due to studies being made on the radio waves we are coordinating with the jordanian commission for regulating communications to regulate this department because the station would be on the border with israel which demands extreme caution against interference with israeli radio frequencies
1683229 the complications have just motivated us even more to make the voice of our society heard
1683230 the title is very symbolic for us because we live in an agricultural community far from the center of jordan and it is an area that is neglected when it comes to social services this program is our voice and specifically the voice of the women
1683231 when bethlehem 2000 started broadcasting our program we felt that our dream had come true even if only partly
1683232 what is important is to be heard in every household in the valley im happy that the heads of all the municipalities in the valley listen to our program and even respond to our remarks this has had a real impact on the women because they felt the media has finally reached the valley and what has been even more significant is the fact that it is the women who are speaking out
1683233 when i first heard of the radio station i anticipated many problems but after i heard the first episode on bethlehem 2000 radio i decided to participate because i realized it was the only opportunity for me to become active in my community and to help the girls transcend their traditional roles in society
1683234 my participation is about supporting women and men in realizing the roles that all community members play in their society
1683235 we are in terrible need for a voice to express our feelings as girls living in a community ruled by old customs and traditions that sometimes hinder a girls ambitions
1683236 government officials dont help with the weaknesses of the infrastructure which requires serious development i think the station will help propel the peoples concerns especially the womens to the higher levels of government
1683237 at the initial stage of the project i was running against time to have a scoop in the arab world a women run radio station in a community like the valley had not been done before and i knew the station would also prove that women were capable of leadership
1683238 rural society needs to be encouraged to do more for itself at first i was afraid the project would be rejected but since then i have delegated a great deal of the work to the girls because i saw how excited they were about the radio station
1683239 the project has increased my personal interaction with the community i now feel that i have a role to play in addressing womens problems and the people in my community
1683240 now i am unafraid to speak to government officials to follow social causes to search for the truth and to solve problems the journalism training has helped me with all of these things

1683330 theres a lot of people on our team who arent happy with our class choices
1683331 but after weve established diablo iii as its own game with its own type of gameplay and experiences i wouldnt be opposed to looking at old classes we are trying to design the witch doctor class so that if we did bring back the necromancer theres room for him were looking out ahead of time at what our expansions are going to be so weve got to keep room open for some of those other classes down the road

1683605 the results of our study suggest that treatment to eradicate h pylori reduces the risk of developing new gastric carcinoma in patients who have a history of such disease and are thus at risk for developing further gastric cancers
1683606 we believe that our data add to those from previous studies showing a causal relationship between h pylori infection and gastric cancer and also support the use of h pylori eradication to prevent the development of gastric cancer
1683607 colonoscopy is used to screen for colorectal cancer in many countries although direct evidence from published randomised trials of benefits versus risks are not available
1683608 yet worldwide gastric cancer kills more people and there is better evidence that h pylori eradication can prevent mortality than there is for colonoscopy screening preventing gastric cancer by eradicating h pylori in high risk regions should be a priority

1683618 several theological issues surfaced in peace committee discussions but scripture and the inerrancy of scripture were always foremost
1683619 i believe the bible is god inspired in all things related to the first purpose of the bible to bring wayward humankind back to god the bible is without error but when the bible speaks of science and historical detail the bible has some errors moderates do not believe the bible is full of errors but there are errors inerrantists do not admit this moderates do because it is the truth
1683620 no one who is informed on the subject of the sbc controversy is objective i have a point of view that does not give me license to twist truth or bend facts but from the beginning i opposed fundamentalism i thought it was wrong

1683761 das letzte mal als ich hier war haben wir mit lausanne 2 1 gewonnen und ich w re gl cklich wenn wir das wieder schaffen w rden
1683762 wir freuen uns darauf es ist ein tolles stadion ein schwerer gegner und eine gro e kulisse wir werden so spielen wie sonst auch denn wir glauben an uns
1683763 wenn man unser spiel letzte woche gesehen hat war es eine ausgeglichene sache allerdings hatten wir meiner meinung nach leichte vorteile
1683764 ich denke wir m ssen heute abend mehr auf konter spielen aber das ist kein problem
1683765 daf r arbeitet man und ich habe ein gutes gef hl ein echt gutes gef hl
1683766 ich denke wir waren letzte woche die bessere mannschaft aber heute abend wird es etwas anderes
1683767 wir m ssen klug sein und sehen was sie versuchen nat rlich w re es toll wenn wir fr h ein tor schie en w rden und wenn wir unser level abrufen das wir drauf haben
1683768 ich hatte nicht den geringsten zweifel dass wir die rangers schlagen k nnen
1683769 wenn wir noch mal auf die rangers treffen w rden w ren sie nat rlich wieder favorit
1683770 wir haben aber in den letzten wochen sehr hart gearbeitet und uns diesen sieg verdient wir haben nicht zu offensiv gespielt das w re zu riskant gewesen wir mussten die beste waffe der rangers ausschalten ihre konter
1683771 die rangers haben sich nach der pause zu sehr darauf konzentriert ihren vorsprung zu verteidigen
1683772 ich werde am samstag nach d nemark fliegen und mir ein spiel von aalborg in der d nischen liga ansehen
1683773 manche glauben dass es jetzt in der n chsten runde leichter f r uns wird doch das sehe ich ganz anders
1683774 ich bin sehr gerne hier und m chte weiterhin ein teil der mannschaft sein ich bin sehr gl cklich dass ich meinen vertrag verl ngern konnte
1683775 ein tor im fa cup finale in wembley zu schie en bedeutete sehr viel f r mich wir haben geschichte geschrieben denn das ist das erste mal dass dieser verein in einem europ ischen wettbewerb vertreten ist jeder will international spielen au erdem gibt uns die teilnahme am uefa pokal die m glichkeit gute spieler zu unserem verein zu locken
1683776 che bello essere a letto con una cosa che poi non devo sgonfiare
1683777 i want to assure you that we have a programme in place within the two weeks that the suspension would last for them to catch up on their studies

1683781 namcols award winning corporate governance systems along with its expanded programmes have enabled it to introduce a range of high quality low cost professional and vocational course offering and to address in a focused fashion four of the millennium development goals
1683782 together these developments are testimony of governments systematic commitment to produce productive and competitive human resources and institutions within the framework of vision 2030 and national development plan 3
1683783 peter please im an x man i dont shoot people im just trying to make a point
1683784 we need to innovate and reinvigorate our approach to hiv focusing on prevention
1683785 our current practices are somewhat dated we need to think out of the box we need a creative new approach to catalyse country and regional level leadership
1683786 mobilise other leaders to advocate strong and effective action on prevention and dialogue on changing the social norms that constrain prevention
1683787 the champions will provide visibility of leadership on hiv there is no better leader to do this than president mogae
1683788 when my own country was mired in the ghastly nightmare of president mbekis aids denial president mogae was coming out very clearly on the importance of offering his people hiv treatment and care
1683789 you are all leaders who have transformed your countries and all the partners are tremendously excited this is african leadership creating african solutions and we are just junior partners
1683790 we know that we cannot sustain treatment and care infinitely unless we substantially reduce and arrest the spread of hiv
1683791 one thing i would ask for is that this conference is a wake up call for all of us on the issue of prevention we have identified this as a problem but we have not moved fast enough to address this
1683792 we need to take extraordinary measures to drive this campaign if we do well with prevention then we lessen the treatment and care burden but the current rate of new infections makes meeting our targets impossible unless we address prevention
1683793 i fear that men who have been circumcised might think that they dont need to use a condom so i dont think we can embrace this unless we can be sure we will avoid unintended consequences
1683794 this is not a time to step away and invest less we need to move forward with big investments we have to be unafraid to fail
1683795 but when it comes to prevention many religious leaders still preach that sikaids a term used to refer to aids in papua new guinea is a consequence of sexuality and promiscuity
1683796 others talk about aids using an apocalyptic narrative they see it as a sign of the end of times
1683797 both sexuality and religion have played an essential part in human society but in recent history the church and particularly the roman catholic church has developed sexual regulations that treat the body as a sacred object and view sexuality as an impurity
1683798 there must be a separation of church and state the state should not interfere with religious questions
1683799 because of this groups such as men who have sex with men have been sidelined in the fight against hiv because of their underground nature

1683803 the police have completed their investigations into the allegations of sexual misconduct involving anwar ibrahim according to the principles and the procedures of law within the countrys legal system
1683804 this charge is only possible on the orders from the prime minister who today faces a confidence crisis and leadership struggle
1683805 during the by election it is important for all parties to follow the orders given by the security authorities and ensure peace and stability
1683806 under malaysian laws you are only guilty when you are convicted otherwise being charged does not make you a convict or a guilty person
1683807 i think the reason they are having it on a weekday is to reduce the turnout
1683808 this is a deliberate action to inconvenience the voters we condemn the election commission for their decision
1683809 we fear there could be rigging we urge our supporters not to be complacent it is going to be a tough battle but we are confident of victory
1683810 we will fight hard against the might of the state in any criminal case the odds are stacked against the accused and in a political case the odds will be stacked heavily against the accused
1683811 barring any unforeseen situation emerging in the next couple of weeks i dont think we are in for any surprise hes going to win the election by a handsome margin
1683812 the key thing will be the margin by which he wins and whether its bigger than his wifes margin as a barometer of how opposition support has improved or not since march
1683813 the government has been telling us that it was wrong for anwars wife to resign so soon after the general elections
1683814 it was clear the club did not want to sell because they have asian champions league engagements
1683815 prince has accepted that the best thing to do will be to see out the remaining duration of the contract
1683816 when he sees through his contract in ten months time he will become a free agent and then it will be easy for him to move without any obstacles

1683818 we are fully launching a system which has been successfully introduced at five stadiums in germany
1683819 we expect supporters to have to queue for 20 seconds less each at the busiest times just before kick off and at half time which means no one will miss any of the action on the pitch
1683820 deposits will encourage people to take care of the card and all deposits are 100 per cent refundable once it is returned after half time although we would anticipate supporters will hang onto the card because any money that hasnt been spent can be carried over for another game
1683821 we would urge supporters to top up on the website before a match or as soon as they arrive at the ground to avoid queuing
1683822 whatever that is nicole the very pleasant english speaking customer service rep told me that the
1683823 people who are rich and have nothing else to do with their money
1683824 this agreement is tremendously significant at a time when the political authorities in israel and palestine and the international community are failing to find just and lasting solutions to the political impasse it means that the pgftu will be able to ensure much more effective representation for palestinian workers while those working for israeli employers will also benefit
1683825 the agreement calls upon the ituc and its affiliates to continue to support future cooperation and we are fully committed to do this
1683826 this removes a key obstacle to future cooperation and the full respect of the rights of palestinian workers decent work is a foundation stone for political and economic justice and we will now be in a position to devote even more attention to tackling the appalling state of the palestinian economy and playing a fuller part in the quest for justice fairness and democratic rights in the building of a palestinian state
1683827 we are very pleased that this agreement has now been reached
1683828 every worker whether of israeli palestinian or other origin must have full rights to the protections offered by international labour standards the outcome of our dialogue with the pgftu can only help achieve this and help lay the foundations for future cooperation between israeli and palestinian trade unions and progress in our shared quest for justice peace and prosperity for all in the region

1683834 private investors have risen to the occasion by providing access even though people have to pay more
1683835 but there is another danger that is looming large for the country
1683836 there is a limit to which you can insist on private investors investing their money in research so the federal government must empower even private universities to access funding for research we know about the distinction between concurrent and exclusive list but we are not saying the federal government should provide infrastructure for private or state universities but when it comes to the issue of research for national development the federal government must provide funds which can now be accessed by a competitive bidding by all categories of universities
1683837 over 400 so that we can compare and contrast it with jamb because jamb is normally over 400 our cut off is also 200 in the post ume
1683838 we do not discard the jamb scores completely of course only those who score above 200 are qualified for the post ume we still use the jamb yardstick for selection jamb requires us to take its list and pick in order of performance for example you want to pick 50 candidates for computer science and engineering in those days we counted one two three four and stop at 50 we still do the same thing now but the only difference is that we might get as far as number 300 before we can pick 50 if the first candidate scored 300 in jamb and scores 50 in post ume he is out and if the next candidate scored above 200 in post ume and say 280 in jamb he is taken

1683855 my expectation at this time from everything that ive heard is that it will very much honour the dramatic and thematic elements of the game they certainly understand the material and are able to provide a stamp of their own
1683856 its hard just in the fact its a movie you have to walk that line between the fact that its a property you love and honouring that property and realising its a game weve sat down a couple of times and had conversations and weve talked with john whos working on stuff
1683857 there was a lot of interest early on and at some points it became so intense that i thought it may at least get optioned

1683891 my father was happy to talk about his wartime experiences at some length when he was asked and wrote down his memories in great detail but he had two memories which caused him great sorrow and pain

1683903 not everyone might be comfortable with it but we need to talk about hiv about stigma about our behavior because silence and inaction are fatal
1683904 stronger more visionary and outspoken leadership must come from the continent most affected by this epidemic
1683905 we must ourselves take more initiative to advance the practical solutions in prevention and treatment
1683906 we have the solutions but we need to dramatically increase our prevention efforts in a new and innovative way which is why we welcome president mogaes initiative

1683941 the passage of the law will help the anti hiv aids fight in many ways what we have presently is just moral persuasion to get people to do what is right and also educate people about the rights of individuals who are hiv positive but if we have a law that backs it it means that those who do not do what is right can actually be challenged in court
1683942 when somebody gets tested positive to hiv many things happen to him he could be forcefully ejected from his house sacked from his office his children withdrawn from school and other challenges arise which he is expected to confront with the burden of making sure that they live above the virus
1683943 whenever we have meetings our female members relate what they go through in the hands of the relatives of their late husbands most times they are accused of killing their own husbands we are still discriminated against in many places and the passage of the law will go a long way to help protect people living with the virus against these social discriminations

1684192 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings

1684195 bapak semua kendala kendala yang selalu menghadang ketika dalam perjalanan ia hadapi dengan senyum dan kekuatannya
1684196 cap yang mereka berikan kepadaku sebenarnya membuatkan down dalam menjalani hidup ini
1684197 aku lihat wajahmu begitu muram ada apakah gerangan apakah engkau sedang mempunyai masalah yang berat wahai sahabatku
1684198 begitulah sahabatku pohon nangka hari ini aku begitu bingung dan agak down aku juga belum menemukan jalan keluarnya sampai sekarang aku bingung
1684199 aku kan sahabatpun sejak engkau kecil bahkan aku rela engkau selalu hinggap di dahanku ini walau kadang aku merasa pegal beritahukanlah kepdaku dan mari kita carikan jalan keluarnya
1684200 sahabatku mengapa engkau diam tidakkah engkau mau membeitahukan masalahmu padaku
1684201 ah tidak sahabatku aku hanya takut engkau akan mengatakan hal yang sama seperti manusia mengenai diriku
1684202 bagaimana menurutmu wahai sahabatku pohon nangka apakah yang manusia katakan kepadaku itu benar adanya
1684203 sebenarnya memang engkau hitam tapi tidak jelek karena memang allah menciptkaanmu seperti itu aku yakin ini semua ada maksudnya aku yakin allah menciptakan mahluknya dengan sesempurna mungkin hanya saja kadangkala kita tidak mau menerimanya ketika dihadapkan pada keadaan seperti sekarang ini
1684204 engkau jangan berpikir dangkal biarkanlah mereka mengatakan engkau jelek tapi yakinlah bahwa dibalik itu semua ada sebuah pelajaran yang sangat berharga
1684205 tapi karena ucapan itu membuat aku down bahkan aku tidak bergairah hidup kamu kan tahu aku begitu perasaan dalam hal ini
1684206 aku mengerti perasaanmu tapi jika engkau seperti ini terus engkau malah akan tersiksa dengan perasaanmu sendiri saranku biarkanlah dan balaslah mereka dengan perbuatan yang baik niscaya engkau akan disukai mereka aku yakin walaupun engkau dikatakan jelek tapi hatimu baik itu lebih utama ketimbang wajahmu bagus tapi hati kamu kotor seperti lumpur
1684207 tapi sahabatku aku sering sekali ingin mencintai wanita yang aku cintai tapi mereka tidak menerimaku bukankah itu karena wajahku
1684208 begini sahabatku mungkin iya karena tidak semua wanita mau mempunyai pendampingnya yang jelek dengan mempunyai pendamping yang gagah dan cakep mereka akan merasa bangga dan tidak di remehkan oleh teman temannya
1684209 engkau menyangka pemuda kurus tidak berdaya padahal ia buas bagai serigala yang siap memangsa engkau mengagumi pemuda yang tampak gagah namun akhirnya engkau tertipu oleh penampilannya
1684210 ya sudahlah aku akan mencobanya untuk tidak mendengarkan mereka aku akan mencoba hidup penuh optimis
1684211 nah begitu dong itu baru sahabatku dan ingat jadilah engkau tuli ketika mendengar kata kata seperti itu
1684212 dari mana saja kamu wahai gagak aku baru melihatmu hari ini biasanya kamu sudah ada di pohon ini sebelum aku dating
1684213 ah aku tidak dari mana mana aku baru saja terbang kesana kemari sambil melihat suasana alam

1684237 it is well noted we have shown interest we have had discussions with madrid over it and they are ongoing the window is still open and we are still talking to madrid
1684238 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
1684239 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs

1684261 i think there has been a bit of that stuff worrying about little things the more you worry the more you think about stuff instead of being a clear thinking person who does the simple things as good as you can do
1684262 ive been under pressure ever since i came to england eight years ago all day every day so hopefully i can deal with this
1684263 the start of my relationship with smithy was interesting but theres been absolutely no problem in this series hes grown up ive grown up and were just playing

1684276 im delighted to have signed ive been with these players for two years now and the spirit is fantastic
1684277 the manager harry redknapp is the main man and i love the fans they are the best in the league like a 12th man in the team
1684278 and i want to score more goals than last season and more like my first season here above all i want to give 100 percent all the time
1684279 im doing a programme with the physios and getting better so i wouldnt want to rule myself out im keeping my fingers crossed
1684280 ive been reading some of the comments on other blogs about this with a mounting sense of wonder at the sheer naivete of some users for anything that is important firstly always plan for redundancy in your systems have an online and on computer service that are synched secondly do frequent backups to a 3rd source thirdly if its important pay for it ad funded services are responsive to the advertisers not to the users its that pipers tune thing
1684281 i am not jose mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
1684282 i am from south brazil and in my culture we never say i will win this or that i just say that i will try my best to win all the competitions but mourinho is mourinho he has a different culture to me
1684283 i want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise for me that people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they love chelsea
1684284 there were many people there its a big surprise people dont like us in england here in
1684285 chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan
1684286 if we win one or two big competitions im sure well have fans all over the world maybe it wont be the same as madrid manchester or milan because our history is not the same and you dont make a history in two three or ten years maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
1684287 since i came to chelsea we have only spent eight million pounds on deco jose bosingwa came in before i arrived
1684288 maybe in the past they have spent more money but now they dont need to spend as much because they already have a solid base
1684289 the building sector creates more carbon dioxide than the total emissions of japan france and the united kingdom added together
1684290 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1684291 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1684292 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1684293 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against
1684294 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
1684295 in america everyone has a chance to do all these things
1684296 you follow the rules people will choose and if im blessed to get that opportunity ill get it
1684297 hes been saying he feels comfortable he feels strong and he feels good
1684298 hes never been away from home for any reason except this so its been very very tough
1684299 his uncles trainers from new york cousins and some fans will all be traveling to beijing to support him
1684300 i am honored to represent my country in the olympics i hope to do it proud
1684301 i also hope that my achievements will encourage other new york athletes to similarly strive for their goals and dreams
1684302 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1684303 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1684304 certainly the olympic games are about the athletes the active athletes who are competing
1684305 he is a normal citizen in this case and any citizen has to apply for a visa its a matter for the chinese government
1684306 visa application processes for any country are done by governments the ioc is not a sovereign government we cannot influence sovereign laws
1684307 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1684308 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1684309 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else

1684321 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
1684322 today we stand as a bold and prophetic witness against the tyranny and brutality by the chinese government against their own people
1684323 china also promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled and the peaceful citizens of tibet have been brutalized by chinese leaders
1684324 today we follow the teachings of jesus in matthew 25 and stand in solidarity with our oppressed chinese brothers and sisters our public witness is a visible reminder that 100 000 military troops and abusive security measures cannot silence the voice of freedom justice and the power of the gospel of christ the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics

1684329 it should be designed in a way to help you win the game
1684330 i saw the iphone as the next place i wanted to be
1684331 i was the most excited about that platform than i ever have been
1684332 but we think its doing well and we have very high hopes
1684333 to increase our growth rate by introducing products that make sense
1684334 to do that right its going to require some investment
1684335 it could be the last stand for the american worker

1684338 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1684339 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1684340 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1684341 ive always been a trivial pursuit fan and i can really see tv audiences becoming obsessed with this addictive format
1684342 once you start its hard to stop and i think viewers fascination with pop culture will keep them coming back for more or they can tune in and be bathed in my boyish enthusiasm
1684343 we have placed our it in eds hands for more than 10 years
1684344 as a bank it is extremely important to have an it partner that secures the reliability of our processes and transactions

1684346 i am certain that we will continue to make an important contribution to sal oppenheims success

1684349 i think youll be surprised at how many people will be available to us next week
1684350 theres a lot of youth at the club and a lot of good players personally ive been impressed with the young lads
1684351 a club like orient helps bring through young english players and give them a chance because you can get overlooked
1684352 the premier league teams can just buy talent so its good to see young players given a chance
1684353 you just want it to go as well as possible and id love to get off to a good start

1684360 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1684361 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1684362 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1684363 state and federal courts on three separate occasions have already satisfied the world courts suggestion that american courts examine whether medellin suffered actual legal harm when authorities did not inform him about certain rights under the vienna convention

1684370 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1684371 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1684372 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1684373 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1684374 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission

1684450 the overspend in 2007 8 was largely a result of under investment and because demand for services has increased
1684451 an additional 2 2m was needed to deliver care at home services for older people this was addressed by allocating additional money in this years budget
1684452 another contribution to the overspend can be attributed to one off events such as the governments free personal care policy over 1m had to be reimbursed for meal preparation charges which were wrongly charged based on government guidance

1684465 no afecta al estatus de los jugadores oficialmente convocados por su comit ol mpico nacional que siguen siendo seleccionables para competir en los juegos ol mpicos de pek n

1684482 there is an obligation to all of us to have a good talent strategy
1684483 we have to grow new talent in the industry our investment and the upcoming community games channel is us supporting the industry as we know you have to bring talent through its really difficult today for new developers to break through and for them to get people to look at their games and its really difficult once someone has looked at a game to give them access to sell that game on
1684484 theres no question digital will overtake physical it happened in music and will happen to our industry
1684485 were going to invest in this region to ensure we win
1684486 everyone grew up with them knew them hung out with them so we just want everyone to come out and support them as much as we can because thats all weve got

1684496 nous sommes confiants dans le fait que nous pouvons juger des cas avec les crit res judiciaires les plus lev s
1684497 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
1684498 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1684499 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran the six countries are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another resolution
1684500 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1684501 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1684502 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps
1684503 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1684504 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1684505 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the
1684506 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations

1684509 ill tell you what ill take responsibility when im president to fix the problem
1684510 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing
1684511 i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1684512 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach
1684513 in the latest version of the islamic penal codes bill which has undergone several modifications such punishments are not mentioned
1684514 the implementation of stoning has been suspended for several people who have received this sentence
1684515 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail
1684516 and the verdict for two others has been changed to lashes
1684517 this is the new yorker so we would never dream of ridiculing the obamas
1684518 when your elderly next door neighbor sincerely insists to you that obama is a secret muslim intent on subverting the us government on behalf of terrorists you might find the cover funny watching the tv interviews with west virginia voters might do the trick too
1684519 well that black guy i hear hes a secret muslim

1684523 at this weeks g8 summit george w bush us president denounced mr mugabe while sitting next to mr medvedev whose hold on power is similarly counterfeit the russian security services methods are more subtle than machetes but our democracy is no more real than zimbabwes
1684524 by making such remarks the iranian officials are hinting at punishing the gulf cooperation council countries
1684525 supporting irans right in using nuclear energy for peaceful means and their rejection of any military action against it

1684554 as long as we could have some good consistent rain that would really help us out this could be a wonderful thing if we do not receive high winds or flooding in the area
1684555 my goal today was to get as wet as possible
1684556 we might go to 11th street cafe and then probably just go jump in my pool afterwards just for icing on the cake
1684557 you can go running around in the rain as long as you want
1684558 and then we can go driving around in the rain
1684559 the us dominated nafta is great with the us being the hub so lets not liberalize
1684560 at an analytical level that is higher than a typical newspaper column but very much more accessible than a journal article
1684561 there was a cowboy kind of mentality and the reality is that kind of approach is archaic racist elitist and arrogant
1684562 now in hindsight were finding lots of places where detectives in those cases they kind of trimmed the corners to just get the case done
1684563 whether thats the fault of the detectives or the das i dont know
1684564 when someone was arrested it was assumed they were guilty
1684565 i think prosecutors and investigators basically ignored all evidence to the contrary and decided they were going to convict these guys
1684566 the criminals already have guns gun control disarms the rest of us
1684567 why arent private sellers licensed btw ive never been exercised by the gun control debate one way or the other im just curious
1684568 no background check no paperwork you see a gun here you like pay me for it and take it with you
1684569 the criminals already have guns gun control disarms the rest of us
1684570 to my mind it is wholly irresponsible to go into the world incapable of preventing violence injury crime and death how feeble is the mindset to accept defenselessness how unnatural how cheap how cowardly how pathetic
1684571 no background check no paperwork you see a gun here you like pay me for it and take it with you
1684572 i would be freaked out of my mind thinking about people carrying concealed weapons on the streets of dc when im walking at night
1684573 i will admit to one thing guns do encourage their owner to use them for instance if one were to be confronted by muggers the wiser course would be to back away while ownership of a gun would probably encourage you to confront and maybe even shoot the muggers
1684574 proper training both psychological and physical should be mandatory for all gun owners
1684575 as a brit of course i was conditioned to expect that the first time i saw an unholstered pistol would be when a mugger stuck one in my face that is how it works in a civilized country
1684576 i dont own a gun aside from living in nyc a non gun friendly state i am afraid of what it would encourage me to do in a confrontation or in a moment of anger proper training both psychological and physical should be mandatory for all gun owners that said id absolutely trust myself with a gun a whole lot more than i would trust the restraint of a thug with a weapon
1684577 id better not get myself a gun who knows how crazy id go if i had a gun
1684578 the seeming resistance in some quarters to any and all forms of regulation is ridiculous
1684579 it seems the most of the gun control crowd tends to suffer from a sweeping ignorance like davido supplied with his comment about guns and gun shows btw someone who is licensed to sell firearms still must do the background check even at a gunshow it is the private sellers who are not required to

1684592 the royal devon amp exeter hospital does not have a pest control problem and at no time has the safety or health of our patients visitors or staff been compromised
1684593 it is disappointing that the pro active approach of our staff to report any suspicions and routine regular inspections by a contracted company could be interpreted as being anything other than positive and responsible site management
1684594 we are a rural hospital it was actually a field mouse which ran in because the next door farmer was ploughing his field
1684595 we found it and got it out we cant necessarily stop pests but when we do find them we deal with them

1684601 the v10 pocket projector has achieved significant interest amongst some of australias largest retailers and we are discussing commercial arrangements with retailers now we expect sales of the pocket projector to be high particularly as we approach the christmas period there is nothing like the pocket projector on the market today it is a true hybrid product that can be used for both business and leisure given the success of devices such as the iphone we expect the projector will fit well into this market
1684602 its kind of slowly being phased out for fullbacks its a larger issue but being a fullback you dont think about it because youre just trying to play
1684603 some plays are our fault some plays the defensive line some plays the secondary but as a whole we had too many big running plays
1684604 he doesnt care who you are you could be donnie edwards derrick johnson he doesnt play favorites if you arent doing your job hell get in your face and tell you about it at one time or another hes been after every one of the linebackers either in practice or in a meeting
1684605 theyre the coaches and were the players so i guess we just have to follow the rules and do what they say but thats what i was told would happen
1684606 you can look at the film and kind of see harris is not really doing what cunningham wants him to do
1684607 chiefs are trying to get the best performance out of the guys they have
1684608 the roster currently at the shallow end of the talent pool
1684609 sure hed consider somewhere else but it would have to be the right place i dont know for sure but i think the packers have called just about everybody tampa and the jets are the two teams out front
1684610 i just hope people understand how we got to this point
1684611 yes brett changed his mind whats wrong with that how many people in how many professions change their mind the packers were pressuring him for an answer back in march its not a coincidence that he made his announcement at that time they wanted an answer he gave them one then after he changed his mind they no longer wanted him back thats how we got to this point
1684612 yes brett changed his mind whats wrong with that how many people in how many professions change their mind nothing wrong with changing of the mind the packers were pressuring him for an answer back in march but at the same time were telling him they wanted him back and he could still play just give us answer so we can plan a team can not be held up by one person its not a coincidence that he made his announcement at that time they wanted an answer he gave them one then after he changed his mind they no longer wanted him back thats how we got to this point
1684613 sure hed consider somewhere else but it would have to be the right place i dont know for sure but i think the packers have called just about everybody tampa and the jets are the two teams out front

1684626 its beyond dispute that obama has become the biggest celebrity in the world but do the american people really want to elect the biggest celebrity in the world
1684627 jennifer garner gave the first speech supporting obama and she was very witty clever and funny
1684628 she was followed by her husband ben affleck then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change
1684629 for a lot of reasons but mostly because i dont like the path this countrys on and if mccain is elected well be continuing down that same path
1684630 i commend google yahoo microsoft and other participants for agreeing on the principles of an internet freedom code of conduct
1684631 this code of conduct would be one important step toward our shared goals of promoting freedom of expression and protecting the privacy of internet users around the world i look forward to learning more about the details this agreement and whether it will adequately regulate american companies operating in internet restricting countries
1684632 while the code of conduct is being finalized i urge american internet companies operating in repressive countries to do everything possible to resist censorship and protect user privacy and freedom of expression especially with the olympics beginning in china later this week we must ensure that american companies operating in repressive regimes protect fundamental human rights
1684633 this is a very effective way to promote diversity of voices and increase competition in the telecommunications industry i support diversity in media ownership because it provides a window into communities languages views and values that might not otherwise be heard without these outlets
1684634 unfortunately we see major news outlets airing too many sensationalist stories on outlandish topics such as immigrants with leprosy black street gangs or mexican plots to re conquer the united states americans should be able to flip to stations where we can hear about asian american ceos revolutionizing their industries african american doctors saving lives and hispanic soldiers many of whom are not yet citizens bravely fighting overseas under the flag of the country theyre proud to call their own
1684635 when we talk about minority run outlets were not just talking about broadcasters were talking about advocates advocates our communities depend on
1684636 these new totals dwarf his previous fundraising from the industry from 1989 through may 2008 john mccain had raised more than 1 3 million from the oil and gas industries and 33 mccain staffers and fundraisers have received a total of 9 65 million in lobbying fees from the same sectors

1684639 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling
1684640 ten senior hess corporation executives and or members of the hess family each gave 28 500 to the joint rnc mccain fundraising committee just days after mccain reversed himself to favor offshore drilling according to federal election commission reports nine of these contributions seven from hess executives and two from members of the hess family came on the same day june 24th the records show

1684642 the centerpiece of sen mccains plan to stimulate the economy actually the whole plan is large tax cuts for corporations it would deliver 3 8 billion in tax cuts to the five largest american oil companies according to an analysis released today by the center for american progress action fund
1684643 republican sen john mccain criticized sen barack obamas call for a windfall profits tax on the oil industry on tuesday despite leaving the door open to the same idea last month mccain criticized obama his democratic rival repeatedly in excerpts of a speech planned for delivery tuesday evening he cited obamas advocacy of a tax on excess oil industry profits as well as the democrats vote for president bushs energy legislation in 2005 mccain reserved his sharpest words for the windfall profits tax if that plan sounds familiar its because that was president carters big idea too im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s mccain said in the excerpts
1684644 would deliver a 3 8 billion tax cut to the five largest american oil companies
1684645 require the oil industry to use its profits to help pursue alternative energy
1684646 i would not require them to but i think that public pressure and a lot of other things including a national security requirement that we reduce and eliminate our dependence on foreign oil and we stop the contamination of our atmosphere which is and climate change which is real and is taking place
1684647 we are concerned that at a time when tbi is recognized as the signature wound of the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan one of the most widely accepted and critical rehabilitative treatments for this injury known as cognitive rehabilitation therapy is excluded by the militarys tricare health insurance program
1684648 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1684649 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s we should require that u s taxpayers be reimbursed for the cost of large projects
1684650 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1684651 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1684652 the era of u s funded major infrastructure projects is over
1684653 last weeks house hearing put on display that the department of defense was too slow and hesitant to respond to an emerging threat in iraq electrocutions of u s military personnel
1684654 while this is a step that should have been taken a long time ago i am pleased that general petraeus has formed a joint task force to not only diagnose potentially dangerous electrical conditions but also make the necessary repairs and prevent future deaths i appreciate that he has committed to maintaining oversight on this issue even as he transitions to the head of centcom
1684655 for fifteen years the family and medical leave act has helped millions of americans balance the demands of work and family it has given loved ones the ability to care for a sick child an aging parent or an ailing spouse when they needed it most enacting this law was not only an act of compassion it was also a practical recognition of the challenges families face and a solution to what for too many was a terrible choice between keeping their job and managing a family crisis i am proud to have helped bring the promise of fmla to more families by securing in law its first ever expansion to allow families of wounded military servicemembers to take up to six months of unpaid leave to care for them during their often lengthy and complex rehabilitation we should keep building on this progress and thats why i am also working to extend fmla to flight attendants and pilots who do not currently qualify by continuing to recognize and help meet challenges we can make sure the fmla continues to serve families for generations to come

1684660 when i attended the dog had been cut down from the tree but the twine was so tight around his neck i could not get my fingers underneath it

1684668 after lamenting the missed opportunity to make dick cheney his own vice president in 2001 mccain will have a chance to choose his very own cheney said dnc spokesman brad woodhouse
1684669 we think its important that the american people have all the facts at their fingertips when it comes to john mccain and his vice presidential pick this site gives reporters voters and activists a chance to review the record and see for themselves that no matter who he picks a mccain ticket means more of the same for families already struggling to pay out of control energy costs keep their jobs and stay in their homes
1684670 john mccain is a leader who the people of maryland can believe in he understands the issues important to maryland voters john mccain believes that lowering taxes is the best way to create jobs here in maryland while barack obama believes tax hikes are the solution to our economic problems barack obama also opposes nuclear power and additional drilling while john mccain believes those opportunities have to be a part of a comprehensive energy solution

1684672 early on it was suggested that this would be a simple project because people in merthyr tydfil only eat pie and chips
1684673 that type of stereotypical image can be found if you go and look for it but in our experience its certainly not the norm
1684674 its to raise awareness of the fact that merthyr is a diverse community people from all over the world come to merthyr and we eat as many different foods as there are nationalities
1684675 its to highlight that and to get away from that common stereotypical view that people in merthyr dont eat very good quality food
1684676 i particularly wanted to reveal something about the people taking part in the project
1684677 little things about their tablecloths how they put their knives and forks down the fact that this woman has a goldfish signifies as to who these people are
1684678 with a lot of my friends its like a running joke you know you come from merthyr incapacity benefit capital and stuff like that

1684691 de chinese ploeg is extreem sterk en behoort in nagenoeg alle disciplines tot de kanshebbers op goud

1684783 its clear that wireless networks potentially give people much greater access
1684784 if a company has a wi fi network then they need to stop it broadcasting to people they dont want to access it they have to securely encrypt it or make it invisible for instance
1684785 there have been reports that in the business sector people are creating wi fi access for convenience
1684786 this makes it much more difficult to track down all the potential access points and much harder for businesses to keep a track of

1684905 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble

1685223 increases in cable internet phone and video on demand fees
1685224 i think now is a particularly opportune time to buy the worlds largest fast food company
1685225 yum brands operates 35 000 restaurants under the kfc taco bell and pizza hut brands
1685226 for starters yum keeps extending its streak of impressive results for the seventh quarter in a row it beat expectations earnings per share increased 16 for the quarter and 28 year to date not to be overlooked either is the fact yum raised guidance again
1685227 this quarter fewer than 5 of companies in the s amp p 500 can boast this triple whammy beating earnings and revenue estimates and raising guidance ironically while most of the other triple whammy stocks enjoyed hefty single and double digit run ups on the announcements yum sold off
1685228 and heres where i think most investors are missing the boat and once again focusing too heavily on the short term yes yums in a pinch food costs are rising and consumers are spending less
1685229 in other words margins are getting squeezed and the company like most others isnt about to raise prices for fear of destroying more demand but margins are only off about 1 across all divisions hardly an amount to panic about
1685230 moreover sales are still increasing at double digit rates so even if yums making a little less on each one pound burrito at taco bell or variety bucket at kfc net profits are still increasing
1685231 not to mention this margin contraction is a short term phenomenon weve already seen commodity prices pull back and this will continue the more demand lightens up bottom line sooner than later yum will get out of this pinch
1685232 even if the margin pressure persists a little longer than we expect it will do little to undermine the long term fundamentals working in the companys favor namely international expansion for six years running yums added at least a thousand new international locations
1685233 ceo david novak expects 2008 to be no different in fact worldwide he expects the company to open 1 600 new units thats 4 4 per day making yum the fastest growing retailer in the world
1685234 of course growth in china is propelling this massive expansion operating profits for yums china division alone jumped 38 in the most recent quarter and it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future
1685235 with only 2 726 china locations yums still in the first inning with the bases loaded and no outs of a tremendous growth story management estimates that china can conservatively support 20 000 locations thats the equivalent of 36 more years of growth at current rates
1685236 and when you tack on a massive 4 billion stock repurchase program a five year average return on equity of 60 a dividend thats quadrupled in four years a non cyclical industry world class leadership and new efforts to reignite same store sales in the united states i have little reservations recommending this stock
1685237 to be clear yum will not be the markets next rocket stock jumping 100 or 200 higher in a short period of time but we can count on it to conservatively deliver annual returns of 20 to 25 and in this market we shouldnt downplay such reliability so by all means keep buying

1685491 despite record production levels expanded investment and growth in both wages and productivity the shrinking or static demand for workers results in a mistaken caricature of these industries as dying nothing could be further from the truth

1685497 yes agree but for me my complexion and body system are beyond hope after so many years of travelling if i am to let the doctor check on the age of my body system he will tell me that i am like an 80 years old granny

1685506 it is very important for children particularly young ones to see men as teachers seeing men as role models is very important
1685507 the idea that men are afraid of being seen as paedophiles is very serious obviously we want to protect children but we dont want to get to the stage where we are harming them because they dont see any men in schools
1685508 as has been the case in previous years the childcare and early years workforce is overwhelmingly female with only between 1 and 2 per cent of staff being male
1685509 both male and female authority figures play an important role in the development of young people and we want the teaching workforce to reflect the strengths of our diverse society
1685510 the number of men applying for primary school training courses is increasing
1685511 some boys can grow up to the age of 11 without a male role model because there are so few men in early years education and i think it has a huge social impact
1685512 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1685513 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1685514 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1685515 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand

1685522 will continue to demand that the president release oil from our nations stockpile to provide immediate relief in 10 days unlike the mccain republican big oil plan that lowers prices at the pump by 2 cents in 10 years
1685523 theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this was barack obamas energy plan
1685524 now two points one they know they are lying about what my energy plan is but they are making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three or four percent
1685525 probably save more oil than all the oil wed probably get from john mccain drilling right below his feet there

1685547 wed look far more favorably at an urgent care clinic that was accredited than one that wasnt
1685548 it means an organization is taking a hard look at a variety of safety issues that should be involved in caring for someone who is acutely ill
1685549 if it is a good high quality urgent care center that can keep someone out of the emergency department who doesnt need to be there that is a good thing
1685550 one of our concerns that people cant recognize when they have an emergency or dont
1685551 a patient who says they are having indigestion and goes to an urgent care clinic may really be having a heart attack
1685552 we dont encourage patients with chest pain to go to urgent care centers but the reality is that we need to be prepared for anything that walks through our doors
1685553 research a facility first to be sure they are going to be seen by a physician and that the facility will be able to provide all of the necessary services that might be required

1685558 it created a tremendous buzz when it was shown in britain
1685559 saying what would happen if i press every button at once
1685560 i think creatively what russells achieved across those three shows is a coherence actually
1685561 its not something were going to start doing every week
1685562 the first reaction i think was that its a sign of failure from 13 episodes to five that doesnt have to be the case torchwood did brilliant business in the uk

1685564 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
1685565 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for its a family title its an interesting intellectual puzzle about how best to place it
1685566 when the next season is available sure well be interested definitely interested
1685567 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
1685568 there was a lot of crying on the production i have to say

1685575 en realidad la gente religiosa har que su sociedad sea un lugar mejor
1685576 pero tambi n son una oportunidad para decir al pueblo chino que respetamos sus tradiciones y respetamos su historia
1685577 deben permitir que las personas puedan expresar sus opiniones y en la medida en que la gente no pueda hacerlo y no pueda tener una actividad religiosa libremente eso es un error
1685578 estoy preocupado por el historial de corea del norte en materia de derechos humanos estoy preocupado por sus actividades de enriquecimiento de uranio as como por sus ensayos nucleares y su proliferaci n y sus programas de misiles bal sticos

1685591 heres the other one in science fiction when we cant express ourselves if were angry or were upset or emotional we hug and kiss a character or we shoot them or blast them in musical theatre we start singing songs
1685592 in series one we were like a young kid learning how to walk in series two we are up and running we know exactly where we are we know what were about
1685593 i am part of that crazy fan base when i was a child i watched dr who i hid behind the sofa like everybody else
1685594 i knew when i got involved what the history was when captain jack was created it was a great opportunity a great role when they told me i was getting torchwood and they were making me my own show theres the responsibility of the many many years of dr who culture that you kind of have to respect and honour
1685595 before they really got to know me a lot of people in britain thought i was canadian i only speak with a scottish accent when i am with my immediate family or when im up in glasgow
1685596 i am my product in my business i love what i do i enjoy what i do and i see my business being the different aspects of the entertainment industry
1685597 im telling you its true because a british newspaper did try to make out that i was telling a lie i am telling the story as i know it when i contacted my agent and asked them to find out why i wasnt cast my agent came back and told me i was not gay enough i was too straight
1685598 when the newspaper came out with that i had to defend myself i was a little bit angry because i wouldnt lie about something like that its just totally hysterical that a gay man was not gay enough to play the part of a gay character

1685617 si el escrito fue redactado por i aki de juana y si en ese escrito hay injurias o no
1685618 dije que esperaba que la actitud o la visi n no fuese la que expresaba en su momento el anterior ministro de justicia en referencia a juan fernando l pez aguilar de construir imputaciones para que entonces continuara en la c rcel o ahora para que vuelva a la c rcel
1685619 simplemente reclamaba porque estoy plenamente convencida de que eso es lo que hace grande a una democracia y lo que fortalece el estado de derecho que se aplique rigurosamente y escrupulosamente la ley
1685620 no se afrontase la situaci n en la que nos encontramos con ese esp ritu que escuch bamos de boca del anterior ministro de justicia diciendo vamos a intentar construir nuevas imputaciones
1685621 sa es una situaci n que habr que plantearse habr que ver c mo se modula o se deja de modular y es una cuesti n que est encima de la mesa
1685622 mientras tanto lo m s prudente es esperar cu les son las propuestas y c mo va el debate

1685628 its wonderful but a slightly easier life wouldnt be bad you have got to have a life as well
1685629 i couldnt say what it will be that i will be doing but it will be more adult drama i have three ideas and one day i will just pick one of them i am very lucky absolutely
1685630 you cant keep relying on your laurels you have to keep pushing it
1685631 there are all these sorts of ideas running around in my head funnily enough i have a book coming out about it i emailed a journalist every night telling him what happened that day to try and find the shape of my brain i guess i am quite interested in that myself
1685632 some companies have tried and its the same problem the music industry is going through now
1685633 we are heading towards a pattern where television shows are released worldwide to try and combat that problem
1685634 at the same time though i dont want to be critical of the internet a lot of people download
1685635 its an issue of quality but its something we have to keep and eye on
1685636 no i dont have any control over that sort of thing i just hope they heed our wise words and act on it
1685637 hemos llevado a cabo esta acci n para subrayar la utilizaci n de estos juegos por las autoridades chinas como un instrumento de propaganda as camuflan su balance sobre los derechos humanos

1685645 our company has experienced very unpredictable and rapid growth over the past five years
1685646 the installation of sanmelody combined with our virtual server environment has given us the ability to absorb and scale that growth without the costly and yearly replacement of hardware that was originally designed to be replaced after three years while we are ready to take the next step and add more disk space to our sanmelody environment the cost of doing so will be much less than the cost of a single server and not require nearly as many man hours as replacing and reconfiguring new servers sanmelody saves us time and money

1685690 cynical nihilistic misanthropes who by their own professed creed dont trust anyone they met him in the flesh showed him where they live and even let him watch as they went about their trolling
1685691 allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around zach asked if i thought i could turn my parents around i almost broke down the idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that i could actually be proud of it was overwhelming

1685697 im a life long fan of doctor who and have been collecting memorabilia for more than 25 years
1685698 i saw the auction advertised on a fan site and knew i had to bid particularly as both my children are now massive fans of the show too
1685699 daniel was a phone bidder on the night and im really pleased that a true collector and fan of the show has secured this script raising lots of money for charity at the same time
1685700 i dont remember what really happened i was trying to practice for a jump before an amateur competition
1685701 it was a silly jump something that could have been like two stories high
1685702 ive been married for 15 years and i have three kids so im extremely grateful on their account
1685703 in the time ive been here ive done just about every case ive been trained for
1685704 it is an excellent surgery you have to remember that the people who are this overweight basically have their metabolism go to zero really the gratitude you get from helping someone in that situation is overwhelming
1685705 the patients response is more than its ever been with any other surgery ive performed
1685706 it is the type of surgery that has guaranteed results
1685707 it is a bit of an emotional roller coaster because you cant do what you did before but dr fath is a great doctor
1685708 he doesnt seem to be the typical doctor he is more personable i put my faith in him and he did a good job
1685709 fath has a different bedside manner he makes a big commitment to his patients after the surgery
1685710 i was impressed that he gave me his cell phone after the surgery and told me that i could call him if i had any questions he knows that this surgery is not easy
1685711 i was in pain all over my body going in and out of the hospital for different things
1685712 one day i woke up and i was completely numb from the waist down
1685713 dr fath is just the greatest he is very relaxed and laid back and he doesnt have the i dont care attitude that other doctors have for those of us who have had him as patients he couldnt come back soon enough
1685714 i am convinced that he is the type of person who doesnt do this procedure for self gratification and money he believes and invests time in his patients because he truly wants us to change our lifestyles
1685715 he told me that the stenosis in my neck was mild to moderate not so bad
1685716 both that and the pain i was feeling in my lower back were because i was so overweight
1685717 it think this was one of the toughest years of his life it makes all of us feel so happy to get him back and making a difference in other peoples lives hes our man
1685718 i think we his patients are all connected to him when you feel like you dont have a life anymore and someone comes and gives you that life back there is just a connection there

1685745 bom sou um jovem anarquista muito interessado em ajudar a construir uma organiza o libert ria que ande ombro a ombro com o movimento social com unidade ideol gica unidade pratica responsabilidade e autodisciplina
1685746 amigos de s o paulo com muita alegria vejo o ideal libert rio e anarquista se estabelecer em uma frente que fortalecer nossas for as dentro de outras organiza es e correntes minando aos poucos as influencias bolcheviques que h tanto tempo atrapalham a luta pela emancipa o humana atrav s de seus autoritarismo que leva burocratiza o em que tantos sindicatos se encontram hoje pela horizontalidade participa o direta e pela constru o do federalismo em nossa sociedade viva a fasp
1685747 temos que travar uma luta inexor vel pela reforma do latif ndio da terra fundi rio do latif ndio do saber acad mico euroc ntrico e do latif ndio do espectro magn tico midi tico
1685748 engra ado que quando comecei a tentar compreender a id ia anarquista eu mesmo achava algo imposs vel j tinha um pr conceito antes de conhecer mas tendo algumas experi ncias com alguns militantes de partidos que dizem lutar pela liberdade e igualdade aqui na minha cidade que ambas as vis es t m um objetivo de estar no poder seja qualquer pre o ent o me perguntava como estes que falavam que estavam do lado dos oprimidos agiam de forma preconceituosa e j err nea j que eles v m os cidad os de cima para baixo eu percebi que por mais que fosse utopia para uns a id ia libertaria que n o verdade realmente ela busca uma forma de mudan a legitima ap s isso me interessei ainda mais a id ia anarquista mas h muito a ver e apreender
1685749 no momento n o participo de nenhum movimento social e nem conhe o muito sobre a pr fasp penso que essa seria uma tima oportunidade para conhecer j que ser o primeiro encontro comecei a me interessar pelo ideal anarquista e obter informa es dentro dos ccs tenho muito interesse nesse tipo de assunto mas como j citei n o participo de nenhum movimento social ou organiza o e n o tenho experi ncia com organiza es assim penso ser essa uma tima oportunidade de conhecer e me empenhar neste ideal
1685750 vejo que a direita e os capitalistas s o muito unidos a maior prova disso que nosso governo de direita n s anarquistas e grupos sociais de esquerda precisamos nos unir todas as c lulas precisam formar um organismo vivo e ativo
1685751 a todos que aqui participarem mantenham sempre a sinceridade em rela o ao ideal anarquista
1685752 fico feliz com a iniciativa de organiza o deste encontro e espero que a partir dele possamos ampliar nossa rede estudos organiza o e pr tica
1685753 a organiza o anarquista deve surgir assim como o anarquismo atrav s da necessidade e da afinidade dos indiv duos funcionando como um catalisador da revolta gerada pela explora o e manipula o do povo e de suas organiza es populares
1685754 h uma necessidade de nos organizarmos pois o mundo se encontra submerso em um mar de aliena o sustentada por este sistema cruel racista e sanguin rio cujo o nico sentido est em lucrar sobre o sangue de inocentes vamos nos organizar e lutar
1685755 a total falta de discuss o dentro das diferentes propostas de organiza o devem ser superadas pela necessidade imediata de inser o nos movimentos de massa
1685756 que haja mais dialogo e respeito entre os grupos e ou indiv duos respeito a diversidade e op es que cada um faz sobre como cada um prefere lutar n o h um s caminho para o anarquismo mas sim m ltiplos e cada um se completa
1685757 um movimento que tem tudo para crescer pois h realmente pessoas capacitadas talvez ainda seja pequeno mas com um n cleo forte com id ias grandes capaz de se desenvolver atrav s de troca de informa es
1685758 passamos por muitos problemas principalmente problemas de ego e isto atrapalha muito perdemos mais tempo brigando entre n s do que contra aqueles que devem ser combatidos precisamos criar f runs de discuss es com mais freq ncia
1685759 o movimento anarquista em s o paulo est praticamente na m o de movimentos
1685760 bem vejo muita fofoca e pouca solidariedade no movimento muitas vezes o meu coletivo cave e muitos companheiros de luta como por exemplo o mo sio foram atacados por pessoas do movimento que nunca nos perguntaram como se dava a luta aqui na baixada esperamos que com este encontro e outros do tipo isto se resolva pelo menos entre aqueles de boa vontade
1685761 infelizmente h muita descontinuidade nos trabalhos e organiza es anarquistas em s o paulo desde final dos anos 1980 e muita divis o entre as correntes e grupos
1685762 assim como em diferentes lugares a proposta anarquista tem sido depreciada enquanto viabilidade pol tica de enfrentamento ao estado e ao capital aparentemente s o paulo demonstra ser um local de muitas tend ncias que divergem quanto as estrat gias e t ticas para se alcan ar isso as que tem pelo menos isso comum em todos os cantos entretanto o que n o se pode impedir associar e enfatizar a falta de comprometimento daqueles que reivindicaram um anarquismo social organizado e comprometido com uma concep o social de transforma o
1685763 o movimento composto por v rios grupos e indiv duos que desenvolvem trabalhos valorosos dentro de suas especificidade por m acredito que existe muita falta de respeito e generaliza es principalmente com n s que somos anarco punks
1685764 desde el ayuntamiento y en nombre de toda la ciudad no s lo condenamos la violencia contra las mujeres y la violencia dom stica en general sino que nos comprometemos y hacemos un llamamiento para hacer lo que est en nuestras manos para frenarla
1685765 i want the finest things in my life so i hustle

1685780 right now as a county commissioner i get what all employees get
1685781 on the day of a hindu festival i went there myself ordered the executions of all the leaders and practionners of his abomination i destroyed their idols temples and built mosques in their places
1685782 aurangzeb ordered all provincial governors to destroy all schools and temples of the pagans and to make a complete end to all pagan teachings and practices
1685783 hasan ali khan came and said that 172 temples in the area had been destroyed his majesty went to chittor and 63 temples were destroyed abu tarab appointed to destroy the idol temples of amber reported that 66 temples had been razed to the ground
1685784 that firuz shah tughlaq made largely unsuccessful attempts at converting his hindu subjects and sometime persecuted them
1685785 the first sentence that immigrants learned in henry fords english classes was and today what is tyson doing its giving all workers muslim and non muslim workers an islamic holiday off and replacing labor day
1685786 tanzania and mozambique actually offered to take these people but they needed the united states and the u n to provide funding for resettlement
1685787 instead the state department said no were just going to bring them into the united states its insane
1685788 everyone is to turn in a report card with as and bs
1685789 any other letter on that piece of paper requires a one page explanation and suspension from a game
1685790 the donations are basically through and through illegal thats number one and number two is how the obama campaign tried to conceal it
1685791 they listed the campaign contributions as coming from rafah georgia they used the ga from gaza so it makes it look like its legal and then for the zip code it says 972 which is actually the area code to dial over to gaza
1685792 accept thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit and theyre also going to flout federal election commission restrictions thats very indicative of what kind of president obama is going to be
1685793 theyre not going to be worried about the details and they wont mind if they break the law to get to the final result that they want
1685794 major news story when a presidential candidate receives money from a bastion of islamic terrorism
1685795 bending over backwards to help barack obama and cover up any negative news about him
1685796 nous nous sommes mis daccord sur la lib ration de plus de 150 prisonniers d tenus dans des prisons isra liennes avant la fin de ce mois
1685797 isra l va lib rer des prisonniers palestiniens la fin ao t dans un geste de bonne volont envers les palestiniens en r ponse une demande du pr sident mahmoud abbas
1685798 nous esp rons que ce geste aidera le processus de paix
1685799 lib rer des terroristes palestiniens sans contrepartie dans un geste envers mahmoud abbas est une erreur qui portera atteinte la s curit et aux efforts de lib rer gilad shalit
1685800 soit il y aura un accord sur tout soit il ny aura pas de solution
1685801 nous voulons un accord un accord juste et je ne pense pas que le temps doit tre une p e au dessus de nos t tes
1685802 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1685803 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1685804 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1685805 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1685806 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1685807 it is a truth universally acknowledged that barack obama must continue to grovel to some of whom mutter darkly that they will not only not vote for him they will never vote for a man again
1685808 yup cuma sekadar kelintas aja we do good we get good

1685812 in order to implement our new structural changes within golden systems we were planning to appoint a chief operational officer
1685813 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1685814 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1685815 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1685816 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1685817 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1685818 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1685819 they get in and get out and so far they do it safely
1685820 we wish them luck but i think it may be a little bit optimistic
1685821 in some ways the more we look at the problem the harder it seems to get
1685822 how are you going to set up the distribution sites making sure you even have something to hand out finding out when the attack actually occurred so you can start that process having your political leaders have enough confidence in the decision to go ahead and order a massively disruptive response like that
1685823 we needed the capabilities and expertise from many parts of the u s government and were not able to pull that together into an effective team to undertake that vision in iraq
1685824 we saw a good growth over the last three years in qatar an average of 25 to 30 in 2005 and 2006 so that is why we are really putting a large focus on it now
1685825 the time came for qatar because we saw the demand in the market and need for technical support and pre sales and promotional activities

1685834 conflicts of interest at drug advisory committee meetings are common often of considerable monetary value and rarely result in recusal of advisory committee members
1685835 isnt keeping track of how drugs are marketed for off label use even though marketing for off label use is illegal and its the fdas job to enforce that law as a result drugmakers arent being held accountable for promoting unapproved use of medicine and patient safety is diminished

1685837 im very happy to sign for fulham ive already spent three weeks with the team and we have a very good squad for the new season
1685838 i know the club had a very hard season last year but im confident that this season it will be much much better im coming here to be successful
1685839 i know also the situation here with the goalkeepers ive known mark schwarzer for a long time and played against him in the past
1685840 i know hes the number one but im here to give my best so that in the end the team is successful
1685841 superleague formula is an exciting new concept and looks to bring together two of the most popular sports in the world
1685842 as a club we are always looking for ways to appeal to our global fan base and superleague formula gives us the opportunity to do that
1685843 some of the biggest football clubs in the world are involved and we are pleased to be joining them we intend to be as competitive on the track as we are on the pitch
1685844 we hope our fans will join us in supporting the team at donington park for the opening race
1685845 we are thrilled to have a top line club like spurs join our championship
1685846 england was one of the final pieces of the superleague formula puzzle we had to complete
1685847 although the team driver does not have to be the same nationality as the club we certainly have no shortage of british drivers who are very keen to drive for tottenham hotspur
1685848 i dont know where i am going to continue my career the season is starting now and i have offers from other clubs one of them is chelsea but nothing is certain were in talks
1685849 its very bad for me to have to watch brazils olympic team on tv
1685850 my will was to be with the rest of the group but madrid did not want to allow me i am very sad
1685851 if we all believe in ourselves all believe in our team i am sure we can do anything all you have to do is put your mind to it
1685852 considering we havent got a big squad i think it is quite good in a way that everyone can gel together we know how we play and it is easier when only a couple of players come in they can just settle in
1685853 the main goal is to start the first game of the season and build from there really
1685854 i am only going to be judged on goals and assists but as long as i come back from each game knowing i have given 100 per cent that is all i can ask of myself
1685855 there is competition for places which drives you on but until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on
1685856 ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds or when your time is up at united
1685857 the manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games and then it is time to go
1685858 but until that time comes im going to work hard and take every disappointment and use it as a fuel to get into the team
1685859 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1685860 also it was good for them to be back in this kind of atmosphere the players enjoy a day like that
1685861 whats the deal with this rap stuff since napster the sales been crashing and since napster the game has been flooded by has beens and never wll be ringtone rappers
1685862 social media experts are so caught up in their only little world their own circle that they cannot think of what might be accepted practices in other communities
1685863 i need you to hold on while the sky is falling
1685864 uh oh i am so pushing the girls out there
1685865 i am happy to be here at blackburn it will be an amazing adventure for me
1685866 listen all the world knows that everton and sevilla are after me
1685867 but i have a contract with rennes and i do understand that rennes want to keep me
1685868 my contract with the club expires in june 2010 however i am staying this year because i have a good relationship with rennes
1685869 next year maybe i will want to further my career but i need to respect rennes they gave me the platform to be who i am
1685870 we have to be a little bit patient i keep saying there are three positions i think we need strengthening in terms of cover or to challenge the players in them positions
1685871 we are trying extremely hard to make some signings but clubs do not want to sell their good players and i understand that
1685872 if somebody comes in for my good players it would have to be a very good offer for you to even consider it
1685873 we are trying hard but obviously the season is coming up very quickly
1685874 we have been linked with hundreds of players and i think it is unfair to comment on players who are under contract at clubs
1685875 until i get permission to speak to certain players i will be saying nothing
1685876 for all the damage to reputations the internet can cause perhaps the greater anxiety from online communication is the weightlessness of it all the whole world wide web can seem like a hall of mirrors nothing tangible no binding no watermarks no notary public seals where exactly is it how do we know any of it is true
1685877 camp has been such an important part of our familys life
1685878 touring the campus with my grandson when he was little seeing it through his eyes
1685879 grandson still comes to the diabetic camp as a senior counselor
1685880 has attended camp since she was 10 and she is about to turn 16 she has hopes of being a counselor one day
1685881 hi tom my name is susan and i wondered if you had a minute to talk about
1685882 hi tom ive read the last 10 years of your work not only at forbes but way back into your days reporting kids soccer at the miami herald since you now cover telecom and i work in the industry how about we meet at the starbucks near your office k 13th when your not on deadline to connect
1685883 hi were in that game do you think were on to something

1685912 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today
1685913 the proclaimed and practiced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
1685914 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature that an outside observer notices in the west today must one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the first symptom of the end

1685922 grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which even if permitted by civil legislation are contrary to gods law indeed from the moral standpoint it is never licit to cooperate formally in evil this cooperation can never be justified either by invoking respect for the freedom of others or by appealing to the fact that civil law permits it or requires it

1685939 production design and scheduling we reached the two last steps of the pre production part of the film making process knowing that the last are not the least we can say that these two issues are effectively the most important ones the production design will give the movie its own style that something that will make it different from any other one calling back the first lectures when we talked about visualization now we take once again this topic into consideration to make our film look at its best but if the former vision we created was a matter of setting up the story now our final effort for the look of the movie will be matter for the eye of the audience and its judgment designing a film tells all about the effective look and staying original and focused on this matter helps the work be itself original and different from all other movies that might have the same features since from the very beginning of a movie we are led into a particular state of mind and all the elements have preferably to make the atmosphere appropriate to the context while for the first 4 elements our judgment is objective and we can tell if the choice of the design production is contrasting the atmosphere and thus it results incoherent for the overall our sentence is personal and general to have an example of how dramatically different can be the design of two movies we watched the film
1685940 thats real progress because it puts the governor and the democrats on a very similar page in the overall budget architecture

1685974 when jesus would walk along the shore of a fishing village a life hardened fisherman would see jesus and shout out oh shit
1685975 the reality and message of jesus life are amazing you may see organized religion and the church as a negative option for your spiritual life but i encourage you to look at the actual life of jesus as a positive choice for your spirituality
1685976 people sometimes treat others as objects to satisfy their own needs rather than as persons to be loved and cherished how easy it is to be deceived by the many voices in our society that advocate a permissive approach to sexuality without regard for modesty self respect or the moral values that bring quality to human relationships this is worship of a false god instead of bringing life it brings death
1685977 maybe immodestly dressed older women think that theyre beyond the age of posing a temptation and maybe they are however they are giving bad example to others most notably their own daughters and grandchildren they too are committing scandal those who see them will think
1685978 the good of our soul is more important than that of our body and we have to prefer the spiritual welfare of our neighbor to our bodily comforts if a certain kind of dress constitutes a grave and proximate occasion of sin and endangers the salvation of your soul and others it is your duty to give it up o christian mothers if you knew what a future of anxieties and perils of ill guarded shame you prepare for your sons and daughters imprudently getting them accustomed to live scantily dressed and making them lose the sense of modesty you would be ashamed of yourselves and you would dread the harm you are making of yourselves the harm which you are causing these children whom heaven has entrusted to you to be brought up as christians
1685979 the high number of petitions signed by the citizens of gainesville serves as an indicator of the power held by citizens over elected officials who choose to push a far left national agenda
1685980 the concept of gender identity was fashioned by radical homosexual groups and advocates to protect the bizarre sexual behavior of a few people
1685981 in practical effect these types of ordinances end up being used to intimidate and prosecute christians and anyone else who raises objections to this form of deviant behavior
1685982 extremists with special rights agendas can be stopped even in a liberal university town
1685983 their successful petition drive demonstrates that government still belongs to the people who want liberty and justice for all not special rights for special groups

1685987 hopefully i can go no 1 but its not in my hands right now
1685988 my competitive nature is that i want to go no 1
1685989 i cant say that 100 percent its going to happen
1685990 i can play well in miami with udonis haslem and then also step outside
1685991 scared you dont know where youre going to end up
1685992 hard worker a good rebounder and an all around nice guy
1685993 me and dwyane really bonded over the last month or so we went to dinner hung out and worked out with each other lifting weights
1685994 d wade is a great guy a great role model and a great professional that i wouldnt mind looking up to him and playing alongside him and learning from him
1685995 they asked me to tell them what happened and how you got to usc and to tell me about you and rodney guillory the intermediary and the allegations
1685996 they didnt care what louis johnson a former mayo insider who spoke to otl and provided documentation about gifts and funds funneled to mayo was saying was right or wrong because it really has nothing to do with the nba or their organization but they just want to know what happened
1685997 they wanted to see my all around game and show i could shoot the ball and handle it and show my defensive skills
1685998 hopefully they liked me enough to find a way to get me
1685999 id love to play in chicago thats my dream just to play at home and bring fans to the stadium and just have fun
1686000 i think im ready if not the most ready to contribute right away
1686001 i can bring it every night and be a winner i can bring the intangibles every night
1686002 everything would be perfect it would be a dream come true i swear
1686003 ill probably faint if they call my name ill need a paramedic close by
1686004 ill hate it anybody would hate their hometown not taking you knowing that it could happen
1686005 but the biggest thing was playing in the nba my work ethic isnt going to change
1686006 its not something that is dismissed i understand that but we do have a decision to make and it ends up being a business decision and that dictates how well decide to go forward we still have a week and we havent made up our mind
1686007 with derrick hes a special talent at a position that you can have him at for the next 10 to 12 years and feel very good about it
1686008 then you can make the argument that michael is a guy who can flat out score and in our league youve got to put the ball in the basket
1686009 its a tough decision because i think michael will come into the league and score
1686010 thats what he does derrick can come in and have an effect on games without scoring youre looking at what fits for how you want to shape your roster for the future
1686011 to play a certain style it opens up the floor more
1686012 scoring aspect is incredibly important and michael has done some things in college that were incredibly impressive
1686013 watching his workout tuesday you could see how easy the game is for him beasley
1686014 we have a really talented young team that needs some direction in some areas and a point guard would help
1686015 another scorer would help too its not as cut and dried as most think
1686016 it couldnt be better to have a young talented team that i feel underachieved last year and then to have the no 1 pick
1686017 how fortunate can i be but in saying that we have a lot of work to do
1686018 we were looking at being at nine in the draft lottery and we end up at no 1 we count our blessings and whatever we do we cant go wrong
1686019 i told people that maybe it comes time for a change and they were looking for a coach who was upbeat and did things differently
1686020 from the time these kids were sophomores in high school we knew that whenever they were draft eligible that they would dominate the first part of the draft
1686021 i knew that whenever they chose to go into the draft that this would be a banner year
1686022 you could tell that by the time we were all seniors in high school that we could all go to the draft just after one year
1686023 its one of the best classes in a long long time
1686024 it might be one of the best classes possibly ever
1686025 i knew at the 2007 mcdonalds game that we had a lot of good players in this class
1686026 i didnt know the impact on college basketball but i knew we would all do some special things
1686027 i just knew during the aau games that this was a really talented class
1686028 hes someone that gets lost in the shuffle but he might be as good as anybody else in the class
1686029 one of the better freshman classes ive ever seen its one of the most unique freshman classes since theyve all exited for the nba at once instead of varying times
1686030 you knew they were going to be great but being a great prospect and becoming great players is a difficult task
1686031 usually someone stays longer and some of the development might be slower but all of the guys played great and all decided to go
1686032 they all went to college and succeeded for a reason
1686033 i remember going to see these underclassmen in high school and they dominated every game they played in theres no doubt in my mind that this group of guys was going to perform at a high level
1686034 it was an exceptional year and its not a normal thing where they all play well develop and have the ability to leave
1686035 and this is not something that will become a yearly thing
1686036 what turned it for me was when i saw him cry after an aau loss and the other dudes were racing to get to mcdonalds
1686037 i just hate losing and i know on the next level ill have to get used to it and hopefully i wont tear up more at the next level
1686038 im really competitive if people say i cant shoot then in a drill ill try to outshoot them i just hate losing no matter what it is ill do it to win winning is the goal for me
1686039 he hates to lose cal was clear that he cant lock himself in his room when they lose
1686040 what i like most about derrick rose is that when the lights are on he takes his game to a different level
1686041 the significance of the game raises his game to a higher level hes a big game big time lights on guy thats when he shines best those guys are few and far between every big game he played our game texas he was phenomenal
1686042 barring injury hes your point guard the next 15 years
1686043 if you can get one like him you do it
1686044 you have to have the habits and the work ethic to truly chase it he does
1686045 it was win win win win and when the ncaa tournament came derrick was going to be the best player at his position
1686046 it just so happens that the other young players lost earlier in the tournament like o j mayo of usc and thats why the spotlight was on him
1686047 hes his own worst critic and he internalizes his game and if he makes a mistake it takes a while for him to get over it
1686048 of course i said the bulls and everyone was laughing because they said its not going to happen
1686049 then it was just crazy it was like one in a thousand and they got the pick god must have had something to do with it
1686050 hes not doing this so he can be on mtv to show his crib
1686051 thats not this kid he doesnt need someone to say hey look whats in my refrigerator hes driven like tiger woods hes got it hes unique like that
1686052 what turned it for me was when i saw him cry after an aau loss and the other dudes were racing to get to mcdonalds
1686053 i just hate losing and i know on the next level ill have to get used to it and hopefully i wont tear up more at the next level
1686054 im really competitive if people say i cant shoot then in a drill ill try to outshoot them i just hate losing no matter what it is ill do it to win winning is the goal for me

1686056 what i like most about derrick rose is that when the lights are on he takes his game to a different level
1686057 the significance of the game raises his game to a higher level hes a big game big time lights on guy thats when he shines best those guys are few and far between every big game he played our game texas he was phenomenal

1686067 thats not this kid he doesnt need someone to say hey look whats in my refrigerator hes driven like tiger woods hes got it hes unique like that
1686068 i still want to go to arizona but if things dont go right im considering going overseas
1686069 the first time i took it i didnt try the second time i did so i had to take it a third time
1686070 mentally i know i can play in the nba but physically is where it would hit me
1686071 i just think i would develop more if i went overseas and i would have played pro ball for a year but if i went to arizona we would have a good team because chase is coming back
1686072 it makes sense were trying to get the eligibility issues sorted out the main thing is that hes considering doing something different
1686073 it makes sense its one of the smartest things ive heard its a viable thing i have personally spoken to teams internationally in europe asia and africa who are interested in this taking high school graduates
1686074 kids know its a business they see this as an option to work a viable option
1686075 brandon mentioned players like tony parker and jose calderon point guards he admires who developed their game overseas and had no college
1686076 brandons main goal is that he wants to play professional basketball to take care of his family
1686077 the reason why i would consider going overseas is to play pro ball for year and develop
1686078 i just want to be ready next year for the draft and come out and show i dont have any weaknesses
1686079 and i hope to know what im doing by july
1686080 i want to get this story out get some feedback and know whats out there for me before i make my decision
1686081 man i would say at least three to four years
1686082 i dont think it will happen within the next two years its so gutted and the talent isnt what it used to be in indiana its going to take time
1686083 he showed up to practice if he was hurt he never said it
1686084 it was a tough situation and sometimes you could see that all of the player defections were going to happen with a new coaching staff
1686085 im not surprised the crazy part was how good we could have potentially been but sometimes there was no team concept and you could tell during certain parts of the season that we werent together collectively as a team
1686086 chase wanted to go back to school and i think hell do really well
1686087 it was a tough year last year coach olson is back so things are getting back to normal
1686088 i tried to make the best of it im still in a good position so i cant complain that much
1686089 he looks great hes moving at a good pace and everything is getting better gillispie said
1686090 these guys arent americans you dont think they could be muslims do you
1686091 making good work seems to require some humility some tears and some fear
1686092 i was not interested in making a record about the d word i got all that stuff out of my system on the last record 2005s pensive songs for silverman which was deliberately stoic this new album is really about me being free which is why it feels cathartic and expressive its about me coming back to being myself
1686093 i came out of the courthouse kissed the ground and walked straight into the studio i felt like a bottle of champagne that had been shaken for 18 months and popped open in the studio thats why this record has so much energy
1686094 it seems like the time has come to release the collection this year
1686095 the songs are timeless and have become classics in their own right
1686096 it seems like the time has come to release the collection this year
1686097 the songs are timeless and have become classics in their own right
1686098 were still in the early stages but this is a lifelong commitment on my part
1686099 im coming out from behind my singing voice to express myself in broader terms and help give a voice and lend support to those who dont have the same opportunities as i do
1686100 it was only once we started talking about the idea that it sank in how many singles theres been from what about me right through to loud and in pieces all these songs mean so much to me and showcase a journey that ive been through with my songwriting and recording my career in general its great to have the new songs on the album as they are just a taste of what weve got planned for next year

1686107 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1686108 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1686109 the vr simulation project is a collaborative effort between unsw and the
1686110 after the lambdatable unveiled in 2007 the university of illinois at chicagos uic electronic visualization laboratory evl will develop the omegatable a new virtual reality display
1686111 to investigate multi user multi modal interaction over a shared visualization sand box using a variety of physical data manipulation tools
1686112 this powerful virtual reality device will enable scientific communities to view share and interact with large scale 2d and 3d data at the same time and will enable computer scientists to study the integration of multi sensory touch and gestural interaction techniques for seamlessly manipulating both 2d and 3d data
1686113 lambdatable is a 24 million pixel table oriented display system built using six lcd displays tiled in a 2 3 configuration with each lcd having a resolution twice that of high definition television the resolution of omegatable will be at least 24 million pixels and will have the ability to display 2d and autostereoscopic 3d simultaneously
1686114 development of omegatable and omegadesk instruments for interactive visual data exploration and collaboration
1686115 advanced visualization instruments serve as the eyepieces of a telescope or microscope enabling researchers to view their data in cyberspace and better manage the increased scale and complexity of accessing and analyzing the data the omegatable and omegadesk are such eyepieces the former supports multiple users sitting or standing around a table and the latter is a single user device that will ultimately replace the desk in one s office both unify ultra high resolution computer enhanced collaboration workspaces and autostereoscopic virtual environments with multi touch sensitive surfaces so that users can intuitively point write touch and manipulate the information displayed and communicate and share this information with remote colleagues these instruments act as digital assistants anticipating and enabling those who work with them benefiting global scientific collaboratories as well as providing a foundation for new computer science research
1686116 we have not had any contact with them because their phones are off
1686117 long live china long live the communist party long live peace
1686118 i hope everybody will share our passion for these games
1686119 you people used to call us the sick man of asia
1686120 a moment of great pride to the 1 3 billion chinese people
1686121 these games should contribute to promoting the olympic spirit of friendship openness and peace
1686122 in the years since china won the bid and even in recent days theyve used the games as a pretext to crack down on people and not just tibetans but the chinese themselves
1686123 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1686124 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1686125 i will be patient and i will be consistent i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1686126 the human rights abuses inside the country still exist and persist the north korea leader has yet to fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1686127 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1686128 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace thats my hope for the sake of our children
1686129 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1686130 i enjoy coming to a free society where people are able to express their opinions and your country is a free society
1686131 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1686132 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1686133 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1686134 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1686135 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1686136 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1686137 but home and gas prices are two things consumers can see and feel in a tangible way

1686139 in the latest version of the islamic penal codes bill which has undergone several modifications such punishments are not mentioned jamshidi said the reformist

1686141 the implementation of stoning has been suspended for several people who have received this sentence jamshidi said without giving a number
1686142 two of them have been pardoned by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and then sentenced to about 10 years in jail he said
1686143 and the verdict for two others has been changed to lashes he said adding that other cases were under discussion by the judiciarys clemency commission

1686145 never waver in the cause to ensure legal protection for every human being from the moment of conception to natural death
1686146 pope benedicts visit was an enormous gift to us millions of catholics are now more willing to live the catholic life more actively but it is up to us to follow through on this opportunity
1686147 let us be co workers in the renewal of the church that our great pope is leading
1686148 it may seem too ambitious to talk about transforming the world much less doing so by trying to create a civilization that is very different from the one we now live in but the earliest christians did precisely that they did so by their example by holding out the possibility of a life that is higher more beautiful and above all more authentic than the vulgarity violence and greed of the ancient pagan world
1686149 gentlemen we have the power given to us by the holy spirit to transform the world in the same way
1686150 never waver in the cause to ensure legal protection for every human being from the moment of conception to natural death
1686151 today we constantly hear about change we must remember that real change means building a culture of life and real change means building a civilization of love and that means truly transforming our politics in this process of change dealing with the abortion issue is fundamental
1686152 certain moral issues that affect our most fundamental values as catholics and as citizens
1686153 this is especially important since catholics confront a moral dilemma when deciding how to vote can we support a candidate who may be attractive for many reasons but who supports abortion some partisan advocates have sought to excuse support for pro abortion candidates through a complex balancing act they claim that other issues are important enough to set off a candidates support for abortion
1686154 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who support a culture of death its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
1686155 must be in the forefront of efforts to defend the sanctuary of human life the institution of marriage
1686156 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1686157 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1686158 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1686159 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this
1686160 suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness

1686163 kentuckians like all americans are hard hit by record high gas prices
1686164 these tough times call for creative solutions and i believe allowing kentuckians the option of using an electric vehicle is one of those solutions electric vehicles may help ease the burden on the pocketbooks of hard working kentucky families as well as reduce their carbon footprint
1686165 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information

1686174 weve asked the supreme court of the united states to reverse the decision of the west virginia supreme court of appeals on the basis that justice benjamins refusal to step down violated hugh caperton and his companys constitutional rights to due process under the law
1686175 what we believe and we share this belief with president bushs former solicitor general ted olsen is that harman mining did not receive what its constitutionally entitled to and thats a fair hearing
1686176 it has long been recognized that there is a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators due process therefore requires recusal only in those rare cases wherein a judge or justice has a direct personal substantial or pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case
1686177 no independent expenditure group ever gets people to vote for you at least from my experience
1686178 and certainly at the end of my race i was feeling i was just wishing theyd all go away because i was tired number one but number two i was starting to see my i was sensing my numbers were starting to drop
1686179 sure i think this will be a very difficult aspect of the case for the petitioner should this be granted i think the court will struggle with that because 39 states elect their judges people obviously contribute to campaigns
1686180 the court isnt about to strike that down as a violation of due process then the question is if giving some money is o k then why is giving too much money not o k
1686181 there are about 8 000 petitions filed each year only about 70 are granted
1686182 this case might have more of a chance than others this has been an extraordinary line up of facts in the state court system weve got a number of different recusals a lot of accusations going back and forth by the media and the justices themselves so theres sort of a messiness in this proceeding that might make the court think it needs to step in
1686183 there is an ongoing problem that states need to deal with when it comes to the fact that most contributions are going to come from people who have cases before these judges
1686184 he knows exactly what we want in every document having shahlavi at the firm literally saves me one day a week
1686185 the idea with someone like a gc is to let the investment professionals source deals and let those that can execute them go get em done

1686236 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package

1686243 i just knew that i had to build a wall i built massive buttresses supporting the cliff and the wall just went up
1686244 about two years ago we had very very heavy rainfall and that completely saturated the earth and we had some drop off about a foot dropped off which was alarming
1686245 i think we must try and protect obviously the areas where the most valued assets are and thats obviously peoples properties

1686248 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1686249 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1686250 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1686251 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1686252 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1686253 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
1686254 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1686255 nocera hopes that within 10 years this will be used

1686262 the endlessly fascinating puzzles that make being a lawyer fulfilling
1686263 most employees want two things someone to emulate and someone to inspire them seeing someone like you that has achieved a certain level of success can be truly inspiring
1686264 one of the reasons women leave law firms in higher numbers than men is because they dont often see someone like them getting ahead
1686265 a good cover letter grabs the readers attention and motivates him or her to read the resume and set up an interview your resume and cover letter together determine whether you get an interview with a particular employer
1686266 many employers read cover letters first and if they do not like them they read no further
1686267 i think its very important for the sector because its a very good piece of evidence the industry itself thinks that following this very substantial fall weve had theres good value around
1686268 stronger for longer is still the name of the game
1686269 you might be surprised that on an absolutely worst case kitchen sink set of assumptions anglos is trading on only 8 9 time 2009 earnings rumours will now start again that anglos is a target
1686270 the credit crunch has reduced the field of potential players and bhp billiton and norilsk who we both feel would like this asset are otherwise occupied
1686271 xstrata is paying a fairly hefty multiple to buy lonmin so you can imply from their 33 pound offer that they see that the pgm market will be at a higher price in 12 months than where it was today
1686272 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1686273 its a bit opportunistic because all the mining shares have been so battered in the last six weeks or so
1686274 obviously xstrata has taken advantage of market weakness mining shares have got so ridiculously cheap i suppose its not impossible there will be bids for others
1686275 we find it difficult to see any other bidders coming out of the woodwork for lonmin so unless shareholders reject the deal we believe it is likely to go ahead
1686276 the accomplishments of women lawyers who have excelled in their field and have paved the way to success for other women lawyers
1686277 commercial lawyers have some level of image problem within the business community
1686278 lawyers do not make good managers it is quite unsuitable for lawyers to move into business
1686279 they are in charge of sizeable international businesses that makes them astute businessmen not just lawyers
1686280 lawyers have organisational skills and insight into the corporate world and are often giving advice on a strategic basis so they do bring these skills to the table many of the worlds top bankers trained as lawyers
1686281 to play commercial roles in their client businesses before they retire
1686282 want more options than simply retiring in their early 50s and spending the next 30 years hacking their way around a golf course
1686283 credit related expenses were far higher than what guidance had been
1686284 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1686285 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1686286 i think now is a particularly opportune time to buy the worlds largest fast food company
1686287 yum brands operates 35 000 restaurants under the kfc taco bell and pizza hut brands
1686288 for starters yum keeps extending its streak of impressive results for the seventh quarter in a row it beat expectations earnings per share increased 16 for the quarter and 28 year to date not to be overlooked either is the fact yum raised guidance again
1686289 this quarter fewer than 5 of companies in the s amp p 500 can boast this triple whammy beating earnings and revenue estimates and raising guidance ironically while most of the other triple whammy stocks enjoyed hefty single and double digit run ups on the announcements yum sold off
1686290 and heres where i think most investors are missing the boat and once again focusing too heavily on the short term yes yums in a pinch food costs are rising and consumers are spending less
1686291 in other words margins are getting squeezed and the company like most others isnt about to raise prices for fear of destroying more demand but margins are only off about 1 across all divisions hardly an amount to panic about
1686292 moreover sales are still increasing at double digit rates so even if yums making a little less on each one pound burrito at taco bell or variety bucket at kfc net profits are still increasing
1686293 not to mention this margin contraction is a short term phenomenon weve already seen commodity prices pull back and this will continue the more demand lightens up bottom line sooner than later yum will get out of this pinch
1686294 even if the margin pressure persists a little longer than we expect it will do little to undermine the long term fundamentals working in the companys favor namely international expansion for six years running yums added at least a thousand new international locations
1686295 ceo david novak expects 2008 to be no different in fact worldwide he expects the company to open 1 600 new units thats 4 4 per day making yum the fastest growing retailer in the world
1686296 of course growth in china is propelling this massive expansion operating profits for yums china division alone jumped 38 in the most recent quarter and it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future
1686297 with only 2 726 china locations yums still in the first inning with the bases loaded and no outs of a tremendous growth story management estimates that china can conservatively support 20 000 locations thats the equivalent of 36 more years of growth at current rates
1686298 and when you tack on a massive 4 billion stock repurchase program a five year average return on equity of 60 a dividend thats quadrupled in four years a non cyclical industry world class leadership and new efforts to reignite same store sales in the united states i have little reservations recommending this stock
1686299 to be clear yum will not be the markets next rocket stock jumping 100 or 200 higher in a short period of time but we can count on it to conservatively deliver annual returns of 20 to 25 and in this market we shouldnt downplay such reliability so by all means keep buying

1686529 enkele jaren geleden stond er alleen nieuws over irak in de krant nu wordt het nieuws volledig beheerst door de economische malaise en de vraag welke van de presidentskandidaten barack obama of john mccain in staat is om ons land weer op de rails te krijgen
1686530 die breng ik normaal gesproken door bij mn ouders in wisconsin al of niet gecombineerd met een reis binnen de vs ik ben ook al tweemaal in europa geweest in duitsland waar wij oorspronkelijk vandaan komen maar een europese reis zit er dit jaar niet in de vliegprijzen zijn enorm gestegen en als ik mij dat al zou kunnen veroorloven zou ik in het dure europa door de sterk gedaalde dollar nauwelijks nog geld hebben om uit te geven
1686531 en verder ga ik lekker lezen in central park als het tenminste niet te warm wordt
1686532 wij zien dat mensen lang van tevoren geplande reizen drastisch inkrimpen of zelfs volledig schrappen van bescheiden reizen twee staten verderop tot exotische reizen naar de tropen door de stijgende energieprijzen gaan alle prijzen omhoog ook de algemene kosten van het levensonderhoud mensen gaan dus bezuinigen ook op het vakantiebudget vaak is die vakantie voor velen het hoogtepunt waar ze al een heel jaar naartoe leven
1686533 die trend zette tenminste voor wat betreft de autosector vorig jaar al in wij zien nu voor het tweede achtereenvolgende jaar minder mensen op de weg tijdens traditionele topdagen zoals bijvoorbeeld 4 juli onafhankelijkheidsdag wij merken ook dat mensen minder verre vakantie reizen plannen logisch als je kijkt naar de recordprijzen die men tegenwoordig voor benzine betaalt
1686534 natuurlijk weten amerikanen dat in europa benzine nog duurder is
1686535 maar als je gewend bent om minder dan de helft te betalen van de huidige prijs dan is ruim 4 dollar per gallon duur bovendien rijden veel amerikanen in energieverslindende autos dat je je met een zuinige viercilinder auto net zo goed kunt verplaatsen als met een benzineslurpende achtcilinder begint pas langzaam tot veel amerikanen door te dringen
1686536 de kern van deze onderhandelingen was dat het een ontwikkelingsronde is dus de allerarmste landen moesten er beter van worden en die zouden er ook beter van worden ze konden zonder importheffingen op de europese en amerikaanse markten hun landbouwspullen verkopen en we zouden subsidies verder gaan afbouwen
1686537 late alhaji babatunde jose was a rare breed of professional competence and integrity his contribution to the growth of the journalism profession is invaluable and his death is a monumental loss to that profession and the country
1686538 he was an epitome of journalism excellence and should be seen as a role model for media practitioners in nigeria

1686561 het dorp barneveld dat evenals een eiland door de zee aan alle zijden door de heide omringd was
1686562 in het koude graf dat zoo nabij de plek was waar hij de heldenziel had uitgeblazen om zijnen ruiters het leven te redden

1686568 such severe natural disaster has just proved that our government team is very strong and can accept such challenges and properly respond to them

1686570 people can recover from even the most serious and persistent mental illnesses such as schizophrenia major depression or bi polar disorder studies suggest that individuals recover or significantly improve when provided the appropriate treatments and support systems over the last 30 years an unwavering effort to use more effective and lower cost alternatives to long term institutionalization led to psychiatric rehabilitation services
1686571 psychiatric rehabilitation promotes recovery full community integration and improved quality of life for persons who have been diagnosed with any mental health condition that seriously impairs functioning psychiatric rehabilitation services are collaborative person directed and individualized and an essential element of the human services spectrum they focus on helping individuals re discover skills and access resources needed to increase their capacity to be successful and satisfied in the living working learning and social environments of their choice
1686572 it is the principle behind numerous evidenced based practices such as assertive community treatment and supported employment services as well as emerging practices such as peer support programs psychiatric rehabilitation services directly address the high risks that many persons with serious and persistent mental illness experience of repeated hospitalizations high utilization of emergency room services low levels of functioning in the community homelessness and unemployment
1686573 they show women in various states of undress including full frontal nudity
1686574 it is something which has been building up for my client for the last 25 to 30 years
1686575 there was a tray of cakes left over from the buffet my friend put three cakes in his mouth so i tried four
1686576 they were small only an inch and a half across but i struggled with four my friend must have told adam what we were doing and he put five cakes in his mouth
1686577 i could see that he was struggling to eat them but then he walked across to the toilets i thought he wanted to spit them out i didnt know he was choking at that point
1686578 i only realised how serious it was a minute or two later when other people ran to help him
1686579 i realised adam was in trouble as he walked towards the toilets his body was convulsing
1686580 there was cake around his mouth and i could hear and see that he was trying to cough i ran to the toilet and started slapping his back as hard as i could
1686581 then i tried the heimlich manoeuvre but he collapsed on the floor and i called for an ambulance
1686582 clearly any activity involving putting large amounts of food in the mouth is dangerous
1686583 we need the public to help us piece together the information so we can discover the truth
1686584 the dog has very distinctive markings so i believe someone will recognise his description
1686585 when i attended the dog had been cut down from the tree but the twine was so tight around his neck i could not get my fingers underneath it
1686586 the dog was heavy and it would have taken a very strong person or possibly more that one person to have hung the dog
1686587 i simply cant comprehend what has happened to this young animal and how it was found in such appalling circumstances
1686588 i find it difficult to put my thoughts into words after removing the body of this dog
1686589 this was his first visit to an eisteddfod and he loved it down here
1686590 a landlord in a pub near the festival also asked me to teach him a few essential phrases so that he could make the pub more welcoming for eisteddfod visitors
1686591 someone said to me it was appalling i didnt speak welsh it makes me squirm
1686592 others have said if you are not a welsh speaker you cannot call yourself welsh
1686593 i would not dream of going to france or spain and not learning the language
1686594 people support the eisteddfod far better in north wales than they do in the south
1686595 in mold last year they worked hard for the eisteddfod people embrace it but i would say things like this get lost in a big city
1686596 there is something for everyone no matter what background or nationality it is an experience of welsh culture and its steeped in welsh history
1686597 there is a clear case for a new prison that can cater for inmates from north wales and their families
1686598 as a council we will be looking to discuss the announcement and its implications with the ministry of justice as well as hywel williams mp and other local representatives at the earliest possible opportunity

1686601 early on it was suggested that this would be a simple project because people in merthyr tydfil only eat pie and chips
1686602 that type of stereotypical image can be found if you go and look for it but in our experience its certainly not the norm
1686603 its to raise awareness of the fact that merthyr is a diverse community people from all over the world come to merthyr and we eat as many different foods as there are nationalities
1686604 its to highlight that and to get away from that common stereotypical view that people in merthyr dont eat very good quality food
1686605 i particularly wanted to reveal something about the people taking part in the project
1686606 little things about their tablecloths how they put their knives and forks down the fact that this woman has a goldfish signifies as to who these people are
1686607 with a lot of my friends its like a running joke you know you come from merthyr incapacity benefit capital and stuff like that
1686608 i think everyone does think we live on chips and turkey twizzlers
1686609 i just love cooking and i like to cook things from scratch and now ive got children im keen for them to know that things can be made easily and taste nice
1686610 if the two kids that have moved out are coming over i do it for them all they love it
1686611 its all cooked in one pan and you cook the chicken first then half fry the cauliflower and the scallops then you put them on top
1686612 when thats nearly done you add the rice and turn it upside down on a tray
1686613 i also do a salad youve got to have it with salad
1686614 my sister does all the cooking i never cook if i can help it

1686632 the car was already well alight and a passer by who had tried to get the man out had been driven back by the heat and smoke
1686633 we managed to open the drivers door and the sergeant undid the mans seatbelt but then the officer himself was overcome by the fumes
1686634 the flames were about 20ft 7m high and the heat was tremendous but i was able to drag him out and pulled him about 400 366m yards down the road in case the petrol tank exploded
1686635 it was a split second decision and i knew that it could go up at any time but the over riding urge was to get the man out
1686636 it was an exceptional act of courage which deserved to be acknowledged
1686637 vele digitale goederen en diensten worden steeds meer bestempeld als absoluut noodzakelijk vooral in de leeftijdscategorie onder de 35 jaar
1686638 toestellen zoals de iphone dragen ongetwijfeld bij tot de bekendheid en het gebruik van mobiele muziekdiensten mensen die vandaag vijftien of twintig jaar oud zijn zullen wellicht rechtstreeks kopen met hun mobiele telefoon die zal de volgende jaren de drijvende kracht zijn achter de groei van de sector
1686639 weliswaar zullen de meeste transacties beperkt blijven tot bedragen tussen drie en vijf dollar maar toch zal er een voldoende aantal consumenten zijn die hun mobiele telefoon zullen gebruiken om muziek games tickets infotainment en andere digitale goederen te kopen
1686640 dat zal het totale bedrag aan transacties tegen 2013 verzevenvoudigen

1686645 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1686646 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1686659 they were very eager to take the right action which was to apologize to their hosts
1686660 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1686661 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1686662 we offer our sincere apologies to bocog the city of beijing and the people of china if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent
1686663 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly
1686664 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended
1686665 we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1686666 you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment and in this case some of them did
1686667 were not chastising anybody they came forward of their own volition
1686668 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1686669 they were overly cautious those athletes have written an apology to bocog
1686670 we believe hopefully this will be the last incident of this kind
1686671 i think there were a few mike stands that stayed in the truck investigators are going to look for any elements that can help them try to find possible suspects

1686679 i dont want to forget the hungarian gp because in a certain way it was one of the best races i ever had in formula one but it didnt end as the others with a win
1686680 it was a shame because i really think that me and the team deserved the success we had a perfect race at a very important moment of the championship
1686681 when the engine failed i had a strange feeling it was like a nightmare and i wanted to wake up but i couldnt because i was already awake it was an incredible disappointment this sport can be really cruel
1686682 looking at the standings at least i can stay calm because not even lewis won but we cant throw away points like that
1686683 we lost ten but the positive aspect is that weve demonstrated that were strong
1686684 the team has done some great work over the whole weekend in terms of strategy and eliminating the problems we had in england and germany
1686685 superleague is an exciting new concept and looks to bring together two of the most popular sports in the world

1686687 we intend to be as competitive on the track as we are on the pitch and we hope our fans will join us in supporting the team at donington park on august 30 31 for the opening race of the season
1686688 although the team driver does not have to be the same nationality as the club we certainly have no shortage of british drivers who are very keen to drive for tottenham hotspur
1686689 england was one of the final pieces of the superleague puzzle we had to complete and we are thrilled to have a top line club like spurs join our championship

1686701 im sure if you would plug him into a power station he would light an entire town
1686702 he was relentless he worked like an animal i do not think anyone in africa can work like he had this is an end of an era in namibian journalism
1686703 smittie who might himself have coined the phrase of george orwell that in times of universal deceit telling the truth will be a revolutionary act was of the publish and be damned school of journalism who gave the baptism of fire into the craft when i started out in the mid 70s
1686704 love him or hate him and many did in probably equal proportions smittie began to speak out against injustice at a time when it was not popular to do so often coming into open conflict with the afrikaner hierarchy in the apartheid years
1686705 he called south africa the foreign occupational force and while this country was under south african rule he always propagated for a free namibia he was always anti apartheid
1686706 i think he enjoyed the controversy but he was very powerful when he knew he was right that made him fearless as a family we were always comforted by the knowledge that he was right when he said he was
1686707 he had an incredible nose for news he would get stories where no one else cared to look
1686708 a moment of relief at the end of a hard days work
1686709 there is no other journalist like him sometimes smitties reporting bordered on the unethical the sex pages of the windhoek observer were often regarded as distasteful but he had a tremendous amount of energy as a journalist who brought to light political and business misdeeds and corruption and for that he deserves respect
1686710 he was the most experienced reporter on legal matters he was always on top of things
1686711 he was our father friend advisor he was a good man
1686712 i think he pushed his staff hard because he saw some potential in everyone and he was keen to have everyone do better every time
1686713 smittie will for sure go down the annals of history as a tireless thorough heroic and legendary fighter for the right to freedom of expression and opinion and as a role model for most of us in this field
1686714 smitties body has gone silent to most of us in the field of democracy human rights and good governance his spirit lives on eternally

1686721 the title came from a piece of poetry that magogo wrote it came from the realisation that our identity is complex and that there is an unseen force that join us together as human beings

1686723 i will not dare say that i am now more of a dancer but i can say that just working with these dancers has made me aware of my body as an instrument that i can use for poetry

1686741 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1686742 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1686743 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1686744 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds

1686750 we feel better at least there is someone around that you can trust and knows how to help you
1686751 if you look around and see the soldiers you automatically feel safer
1686752 i believe we are on the right track to guarantee more safety for citizens to give them the feeling that the state is there and it is serious about fighting crime
1686753 the soldiers make you feel safer but its sad that we need them
1686754 i think it is a good measure as long as it is temporary
1686755 if it lasted longer it would give me a sense of militarization
1686756 no one is afraid of the military but to use them in cities is a media move to cover up the cuts to security forces

1686762 the thought of wiping out another 100 000 people was too horrible

1686819 during the 1780s many if not most americans believed that the nation would inevitably divide in two as a foreign traveler remarked in 1781 the possibility of a separation of the federal union into two parts at no distant day was a matter of frequent discussion and seemed to be an opinion that was daily gaining ground

1686830 seven years after anthrax laced letters terrorized an already frightened nation a new suspect suddenly emerged in the public eye this week but he was gone just as quickly committing suicide before he could be charged with murder and adding another dramatic twist to the bizarre episode the governments working theory that brilliant but troubled army scientist bruce e ivins released the anthrax to test his cure for the toxin answers some of the questions perhaps but many details remain unclear i think the fbi owes us a complete accounting of their investigation and ought to be able to tell us at some point how were going to bring this to closure said former senate democratic leader tom daschle of south dakota whose office received a letter containing the deadly white powder in 2001 its been seven years theres a lot of unanswered questions and i think the american people deserve to know more than they do today ivins unexpected emergence as the top and perhaps only suspect in the anthrax attacks follows on the heels of the governments exoneration of another army scientist in the case last month the justice department cleared ivins colleague steven hatfill who had been wrongly suspected in the case and paid him 5 8 million
1686831 over the past week the media was gripped by the news that the fbi was about to charge bruce ivins a leading anthrax expert as the man responsible for the anthrax letter attacks in september october 2001 but despite the seemingly powerful narrative that ivins committed suicide because investigators were closing in this is still far from a shut case the fbi needs to explain why it zeroed in on ivins how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media and how he or anyone else could have pulled off the attacks acting alone i believe this is another mistake in the investigation
1686832 usamriid doesnt deal with powdered anthrax i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
1686833 i have been a close friend of dr bruce ivins for years the fbi needed a scapegoat especially after stephen hatfill whose foot the fbi ran over won a 5 2 m lawsuit against them

1686836 people mostly say their government should not take sides in the israeli palestinian conflict just three countries favour taking the palestinian side egypt iran and turkey and one is divided india no country favours taking israels side including the united states where 71 per cent favour taking neither side
1686837 the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima a military base that was because we wished in this first attack to avoid insofar as possible the killing of civilians
1686838 all major factories in hiroshima were on the periphery of the city and escaped serious damage

1686843 thousands of children trapped in the thirty three schools that were destroyed
1686844 the most powerful blow ever delivered against christian civilization and the moral law
1686845 when you deal with a beast you have to treat him as a beast it is most regrettable but nevertheless true
1686846 understanding the atomic bomb and the japanese surrender missed opportunities little known near disasters and modern memory
1686847 would not be as devastating to the city and the people
1686848 a post war myth 500 000 u s lives saved
1686849 history collective memory and the decision to use the bomb
1686850 is far worse than gas and biological warfare because it affects the civilian population and murders them wholesale
1686851 seizing the contested terrain of early nuclear history stimson conant and their allies explain the decision to use the bomb
1686852 the potsdam proclamation offered the military die hards in the japanese government more ammunition to continue the war than it offered their opponents to end it
1686853 it does seem very likely though certainly not definite that a synergistic combination of guaranteeing the emperor awaiting soviet entry and continuing the siege strategy would have ended the war in time to avoid the november invasion
1686854 im confident that when i come to work tomorrow ill be safe

1686856 there was warren zevon for one there was also hunter s thompson
1686857 actually listening to joe biden sound self righteous about anything makes me want to puke my guts out
1686858 and its ugly little secret is that it really doesnt mind being in the position its in politically irrelevant and permanently relegated to the sidelines tucked into its cozy little cottage industry of polysyllabic ivory tower criticism
1686859 youre just another msm whore left gatekeeper paid off by corporate america
1686860 im never comfortable when people call me a lefty if anyone were to ever ask id say im probably more of a libertarian than anything else i believe in capitalism small government etc
1686861 stay dumb and drink beer and vote republican because no real liberal voice the kind that speaks the rock bottom undeniable truth ever enters their lives
1686862 people just dont have the cash to go out right now
1686863 they couldnt wait for their new car their new house and if you asked them how they would pay for it theyd say well get lots of overtime but now theres no more overtime and they cant afford the repayments and theyve lost their credit their cars and a lot of them are losing their homes
1686864 its not surprising that they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or anti immigrant sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
1686865 dont cling to religion they value their faith you dont cling to guns you enjoy hunting or collecting or sport
1686866 i remember getting up milking the cows walking four miles to get the school bus walking four miles back in the evening and milking the cows again before bed
1686867 with all that fundamentalism around me as a child id had to live in my head a lot i thought places like venice only existed in my head
1686868 all of a sudden there were people i could talk to about rimbaud
1686869 i was a redneck kid just out of the navy but id been a reader all my life
1686870 sold more cocaine to hunter thompson than i ever want to think about
1686871 to settle some scores with the bigoted murderous redneck town i grew up in i love em but they need a good ass kicking
1686872 the first question asked after the death of a father is who gets daddys guns
1686873 the crack of a distant rifle or the wild meat smell of a deer hanging under a porch lightbulb on a snowy night still bewitches me with the same mountain folk animism it did when i was a boy
1686874 when the left began to demonise gun owners in the 1960s they not only were arrogant and insulting because they associated all gun owners with criminals but they also were politically stupid
1686875 solidly fundamentalist and neoconservative where nearly everyone over 50 has serious health problems and poor credit
1686876 these days the neighborhood looks as if it was painted by edward hopper then bleakly populated with gangstas old men with 40oz malt liquor bottles hard working single moms and kids on cheap busted tricycles
1686877 he tells me things like i helped cast out a demon the other day joey i wish you could have been there
1686878 the last time i saw him alive we talked about it
1686879 he asked me will you be saved will you join me on canaans shore i feigned belief to give a dying man solace
1686880 our average customer wanted to be the middle class person they see on television
1686881 every day we saw folk who were simply trying to get what madison avenue the centre of the us advertising industry says they should have the new car and the new house with the wide screen tv and they were willing to pay all of their income to get it
1686882 in those days i could have got a ham sandwich a mortgage
1686883 they moved it so there would be more room to fight
1686884 in years past there might have been an armed rebellion against oppression
1686885 now they just seem to take it on the chin
1686886 i thought her husband did a really good job politically
1686887 i dont vote party or colour or any of that stuff
1686888 i vote for the person who will do best for us it could be obama but right now i dont know
1686889 the best kept redneck secret is we all have black members of the family
1686890 those kind of votes will cancel each other out what decides it is the 10 15 in the middle who are actually paying attention
1686891 cant keep the same chain of thought from the beginning of a speech to the end
1686892 its not so much that we cling to guns and religion but guns and religion cling to us as a matter of culture
1686893 its a kind of inchoate anger that nobody knows what to do with nobody knows its name or face
1686894 he looks as dumb as we feel when you see a president who looks aw shucksy about everything you kinda like that around here
1686895 what the democrats have done is lose contact with the people
1686896 isabelle bordage is still horrified after someone called her about her then lost dog foxie and told her he had left it dead in a parking lot and its legs were cut off
1686897 this is the danger of these private arrangements if its on consent theres very little investigation
1686898 probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing the worst
1686899 there are obviously very strict standards to become a foster parent
1686900 its now clear that in fact he has a very strong defence to this extradition
1686901 he should now be released pending the completion of the extradition proceedings
1686902 id been in the woods there or four times or more picking in the same area but i think i set my pail down i had a plastic butter dish and i thought id fill it then go back to my pail but i couldnt find it
1686903 i think i made too wide a circle and got in territory i didnt know
1686904 i sat between these two rocks and i looked up and there was a wolf looking at me i kind of swore at him and told him to get out of there and he run away he went
1686905 i got down on my hands and knees and brushed the scum off this pond and was going to have a bit to drink and my arms give out and im right in the pond over my head
1686906 i cant swim but i came out i lost my glasses but i came out
1686907 i fell off rocks i hurt my knee i hit my head and blacked my eye i just had a terrible time walking but i managed
1686908 i kind of prayed that they would come over me but they didnt and i couldnt walk down there because i couldnt see
1686909 it was a terrible time and we didnt even know shed been missing she was already gone all night and all day before we realized she was missing so it was quite a length of time already before wed even started the search and it was just a terrible thing to go through
1686910 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1686911 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1686912 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1686913 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1686914 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1686915 this would presumably indicate that the foot belongs to a new missing person
1686916 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1686917 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1686918 so i dont rule it out we find things on beaches all the time that come from all over the world so who knows
1686919 well be consulting with oceanographers yet again to see if that is a possibility and we will be comparing the information obtained from the sherrifs department with our list of missing persons to see if we can make a possible link
1686920 theres a couple of things that come to mind immediately
1686921 in the last couple of years weve had these tsunamis where thousands of people have died you cant help but think is it related to the tsunamis
1686922 we urgently need this new law to regulate the timber market so that consumers are not made unwilling accomplices of forest crimes it is unthinkable that forest ecosystems are degraded for the sake of cheap garden furniture paper tissues and disposable construction material
1686923 when the market was buoyant if a developer did breach a contract for whatever reason suppliers and subcontractors would have been unliely to bite the hand that feeds them by suing and could probably quite easily find another job to take its place
1686924 i wouldnt have said this at the end of a quarter but after four quarters its time to take stock bnp paribas is clearly different from the rest
1686925 it is well noted we have shown interest we have had discussions with madrid over it and they are ongoing the window is still open and we are still talking to
1686926 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
1686927 this report contains unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1686928 gather evidence showing the implication of the french state in the genocide carried out in rwanda in 1994
1686929 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda moving beyond our difficult past remains intact
1686930 this report is an important step of which france should be happy
1686931 for diplomacy it is a very good basis the relation between rwanda and france should be based on the truth
1686932 the government has asked the courts to use this report we hope that legal proceedings will follow
1686933 in the past few years we have seen an insidious attempt to rewrite history it aims to turn france from an involved party into an accomplice to the genocide
1686934 during my time as head of french diplomacy we did everything we could to help the reconciliation of rwandans
1686935 the fall in the readiness to place orders in the industrial sector seen in recent months is continuing
1686936 demand from abroad is slowing more sharply than domestic demand which is also on a downwards trajectory as a result prospects for industrial production all in all have worsened
1686937 the support from already received orders is drying up very quickly suggesting an end to the boom days in industrial production is close at hand
1686938 in this report there are unacceptable accusations made against french political and military officials
1686939 one can question the objectivity of the mandate given to the independent commission charged by the rwandan authorities with gathering evidence showing the french states involvement in the genocide committed in rwanda in 1994
1686940 we cannot of course be surprised by the conclusions of this commission given its name
1686941 our determination to build a new relationship with rwanda beyond this difficult past remains intact
1686942 truth is difficult to come by and a lot of us dont hear it enough were probably not brave like him solzhenitsyn
1686943 no one can hide forever one mistake karadzic made was enough to lead to his arrest
1686944 the regular exchange of information is under way between security agencies on finding and arresting
1686945 these activities will continue until mladic is arrested or surrendered
1686946 the whole country remains their hostage they have either to surrender or to be arrested very soon to allow the country and its citizens to have the status they deserve
1686947 this is a major phenomenon that could endanger the cinema and audiovisual industry
1686948 it was a successful meeting we have an agreement to release more than 150 prisoners in israeli jails before the end of this month
1686949 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1686950 this accident is a very sad and disastrous event in our mountaineering history
1686951 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy
1686952 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1686953 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1686954 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1686958 soldiers guarded him in the labour camp and now they are around him here she said
1686959 the gulag archipelago which was not officially published in the soviet union until 1989 although it circulated underground the work inspired a generation of soviet dissidents
1686960 matryonas place in the journal novy mir in 1963 she still remembers the details 45 years later
1686961 this is a man i had always wanted to see she said
1686962 it is just too bad it was only after his death
1686963 this is a growing business with excellent prospects for success
1686964 as the owner and operator of some of the countrys leading sports and entertainment websites were excited about bringing a unique experience to our digital audiences

1687008 previous research has shown that a childs risk of developing asthma is lower if he or she is exposed to bacteria or bacterial products endotoxins in early life hygiene hypothesis probably because it assists in the development of a childs immune system however our research suggests that one possible mechanism for this hypothesis may involve the chemicals found in domestic cleaning products these chemicals have been linked to increased risk of asthma with additional evidence from studies of workers who have exposure to cleaning chemicals
1687009 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
1687010 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
1687011 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1687012 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1687013 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
1687014 by measuring the air quality in both areas we will be able to show the efficacy of the bricks

1687017 mps1 is a rational target because of its critical role in preventing aneuploidy
1687018 this work presents the first crystallographic structure of human mps1 an important regulator of chromosomal stability and a potential target in cancer therapy our research has revealed several important structural features and additional binding sites that could be exploited for the development of specific mps1 inhibitors
1687019 interactions of s aureus with fibronectin were first reported more than 30 years ago and yet we still dont understand precisely how and why the bacteria target this human protein
1687020 our studies provide a significant step toward solving that issue and could help the future development of new treatments for rare but serious conditions such as infective endocarditis an infection of the lining or valves of the heart
1687021 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
1687022 environmental change is one of the big challenges facing the world today these long term data on the seasonal appearance of flying aphids not only show that there are already noticeable changes in the uk climate but they also provide the knowledge which will help to mitigate the consequences
1687023 the effects of todays rough economy can certainly be felt on most everyones pocketbook
1687024 when trimming grocery lists or school meal plans to save money its important to remember the nutritional and economic value that nutrient rich foods like milk provide for our children milk cheese and yogurt are especially critical for growing children as they contain a unique combination of nine essential nutrients critical for bone health and development
1687025 in the current study we focused on preexisting psychiatric risk factors for postpartum suicide attempts resulting in hospitalization most importantly a prior psychiatric or substance use diagnosis among postpartum women significantly increased the risk of a serious postpartum suicide attempt one implication of this study is that screening for past history of psychiatric and substance use diagnoses as part of routine prenatal care may be a means of identifying women at high risk of postpartum suicide attempt although a recent review of prenatal screening for depression cited insufficient evidence to recommend screening as a way to improve outcomes
1687026 future studies should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period if found to be effective such interventions may prevent the devastating impact associated with postpartum suicide attempt

1687028 it appears to be true that lianas grow more rapidly at higher levels of c02
1687029 but there could be other explanations for the increase in lianas too weather could be a factor
1687030 if lianas can grow far more than trees during seasonal droughts then global increases in drought from such events as el ni o or la ni a may be responsible for the documented increases in liana abundance

1687273 in my opinion mr dogg is abusing the legal system to oppress an innocent person who should be held up as an example for teens everywhere he did not trademark all uses and meanings of the word snoop and this product in no way creates any confusion or association with his likeness or brand
1687274 in that case you had a single person able to hold an entire multimillion dollar company hostage so that it lost millions just waiting for the case to be heard you also had an open intent by the company to invoke the image of spike lee among others heaths mother came up with the name snooptunes and she strongly dislikes rap music she had no intention of invoking a gangsta image for her teenage daughters product moreover there is no economic hostage opportunity for dogg we are talking about a start up that needs capital to grow not a company with coffers to pay off frivolous lawsuits just to avoid the cost of fighting this case will have to be resolved on the basis of its legal merits and though i am not an attorney i do not believe he is in the position of power on that subject

1687289 weakening in the governments long held position that settlements were illegal and an obstacle to peace
1687290 entertaining the pioneers of this colonization movement has certain given the strong impression that britain tacitly endorses it or no longer objects to it
1687291 strongly in favor of expanding these settlements and even return settlements dismantled in the 2005 disengagement plan
1687292 we would like to know what steps are being taken to ensure that this never happens again and that british tax payers money is spent entertaining those who violate the fourth geneva conventions and whose very presence has been an obstacle to a vital and much needed peace deal in the middle east
1687293 i should like first of all to reiterate our firm position that all israeli settlements on occupied palestinian territory are illegal under international law you will indeed have seen that the prime minister spelled this out very clearly during his recent visit to the region and made clear including in a speech to the knesset on 21 july that we want to see an immediate freeze of settlement activity and indeed withdrawal from them
1687294 our embassy in tel avivs contacts with the settler community have been with the goal of setting out the british governments view on this issue and to seek to convince them that settlements are a significant obstacle to peace but you are right that their presence at this event was not helpful and the embassy is reviewing its procedures to ensure that it does not happen in the future

1687547 bishop moxon who is one of three new zealand archbishops is saying little doubtless he sees it as a debate to be held within the confines of the church but whether he likes it or not that is not possible it would be useful to know just where a head of the church stands
1687548 we at st peters cathedral welcome all people young and old male and female gay and straight black and white rich and poor because god does not discriminate against anyone
1687549 although our bishops have asked us to exercise restraint and to refrain from comment i am concerned that these requests have been regarded rather lightly and at the way in which views have been expressed particularly the passage below
1687550 if the homosexual couple are seeking to acknowledge the presence of god in their life together and are seeking gods grace to help them to be gracious to one another i would find it difficult indeed to withhold a blessing
1687551 i think everybody in the bullpen is finding out how tough todd jones job was thats what i think
1687552 its a tough job everybody thinks they can get the 27th out its a little tougher than people think
1687553 it was a heck of a battle but if you cant hold one run two run leads late im talking about anybody youre not going to win the game
1687554 when you need three outs to win the game and lose it its tough luck
1687555 what can you do were all professionals here turn the page
1687556 we had zumaya coming in just didnt get it done tonight
1687557 i thought i played the ball perfect everything was right i dont know what happened at the last minute
1687558 its going to be a great chance to see the new guys
1687559 a lot of young guys are going to play more
1687560 i dont know that they had all the talent but they played team football
1687561 they played great defense and they ran the ball i thought that was just an awesome job of coaching football
1687562 these guys were in first place before i got here
1687563 i feel like usually im probably the loud one before the game but in no way shape or form am i on this team
1687564 i came up as a second hitter so i really wasnt thinking about home runs
1687565 even now the main thing is getting guys over and getting them in its not hitting the ball out of the ballpark but that is what people are fascinated with is the home runs
1687566 when i had the initial conversation with him i explained we were not asking you to be our everyday center fielder were only asking you to go out there when you feel great
1687567 i look forward to assisting both the riding and the next candidate in the upcoming election said morrissey a former provincial cabinet minister however a number of new opportunities have arisen in the private sector which make my continued candidacy untenable especially given the continued uncertainty over an election date
1687568 after a great deal of careful consideration and consultation i believe another individual should be offered the opportunity to contest the riding on behalf of the liberal party of canada
1687569 u kidding masa u got a bunch of fans to celebrate for u
1687570 i knew right away when the decision was made that we would be real strong this season
1687571 there were a lot of guys who also wanted more than what we had in 2007 and i knew that they knew what it took
1687572 we had a few guys grumble about playing time but it was nothing out of the ordinary
1687573 this team played together all season with a common goal and they achieved it as a unit
1687574 this team is very good our pitching is lined up and a lot of the other teams in the tournament have similar records to us
1687575 we are going to play like we have played all year and see if we can pull it off
1687576 gt greece post left fielder matt bellucco makes a diving attempt at a ball hit into foul territory during saturdays american legion district 7 championship played at newarks colburn park
1687577 it was an amazing accomplishment for this team and i am very proud of the way they played and handled themselves throughout the season
1687578 the aluminum bats were definitely an advantage for us from using wood all year
1687579 every player became a better hitter from using wood for the first 30 games of the year we now take swings at better pitches and that is going to help us in the state tournament
1687580 as long as the bats stay hot and the pitching and defense play the way they did all year the sky is the limit for us this week
1687581 every team has a comparable record as us but monroe county is one of if not the most competitive league in the state and that prepared us immensely to get to this point
1687582 she has been so great with the team coming to all of the games and trips
1687583 they are all like little brothers to us and i wanted to make them a part of it
1687584 she asked me suspiciously why he was there before the game and i just made up an excuse like he had a day off and wanted to watch us play
1687585 it was really a special moment and a great day
1687586 it was a young team and i thought they had a lot of potential
1687587 i love the fans too the fans are amazing every time i have come here i have enjoyed it
1687588 we thought he would be a great addition and he is proving to be so far we have had our eye on kawika the last couple of years so we knew a lot about him
1687589 the fans were incredible arrowhead stadium was probably the loudest place i have ever played in it was just a great experience
1687590 we like to fly around we like to hit people well see when the games start how we handle adversity but so far everything has been going real good
1687591 we have a lot more confidence out there and it comes with the new additions we got like kawika mitchell and marcus stroud
1687592 we have guys who can help us be a really good defense i think that confidence was the biggest thing that was missing from last year
1687593 i want to help this team get back to the top and get to the playoffs
1687594 i want to win our division and make a run and get that trip to hawaii
1687595 this is a community project and its too late to turn back he said in an interview this week
1687596 we need to move forward and make it a success
1687597 im all for the wellness centre says a former town councillor privately
1687598 but im not for the town of montague paying the entire price
1687599 have you ever heard of a rink going bankrupt said bagnall a former montague town councillor and finance chair
1687600 we have to move forward and we will find a way
1687601 verantwortung f r das land zu tragen hei t aber auch den staffelstab rechtzeitig zu bergeben
1687602 ich denke dass es nun an der zeit ist ein paar g nge zur ckzuschalten
1687603 trotz unterschiedlicher auffassungen musste ich auch akzeptieren dass mein bruder ich und unsere familien nicht zu seiner zweiten hochzeit eingeladen waren
1687604 ich gebe zu dass mich diese vorgehensweise damals befremdet hat
1687605 der umgang mit ihrem tod war f r die familie eine riesige belastung da ein selbstmord immer zu viele fragen offen l sst
1687606 heute bin ich frei heute kann ich sagen ich bin ich ich bin walter kohl
1687607 kurz gesagt mein leben war in gro en phasen von ungerechtigkeiten und belastungen gepr gt denen mein bruder und ich machtlos gegen berstanden ich f hlte mich ob dieser erlebnisse und erfahrungen jahrelang innerlich tief verletzt und reagierte bis vor ein paar jahren mit zorn und wut das war ein fehler
1687608 die erfahrung lehrt dass besonders junge leute am wochenende und in den nachtstunden sich alkoholnachschub an tankstellen besorgen
1687609 der alkoholmissbrauch durch jugendliche wird in brandenburg leider zu einem ansteigenden problem
1687610 denn unter alkoholeinfluss geschehen in dieser altersgruppe herausgehoben viele gewalttaten
1687611 alkohol hat im stra enverkehr ohnehin keinen platz insofern ist es mir g nzlich unverst ndlich dass alkoholhaltige produkte das oftmals zentrale sortiment unserer tankstelle ausmachen
1687612 diese entscheidung haben wir aufgrund der sach und rechtslage erwartet
1687613 die fifa hat es leichtfertig verpasst fr hzeitig die geltende rechtslage anzuerkennen
1687614 wir haben keine offizielle mitteilung bekommen die spieler bleiben teil des teams und werden gegen belgien spielen
1687615 messi will das ganze olympische turnier spielen er ist f r die startelf vorgesehen
1687616 die fifa ist berrascht und entt uscht ber die entscheidung aber wir respektieren sie dennoch ich appelliere an die vereine lasst eure spieler teilnehmen es w re ein akt der solidarit t in perfekter bereinstimmung mit dem olympischen geist zudem w re es wunderbar f r die spieler die fans und f r den fu ball insgesamt
1687617 ich bin traurig f r die athleten die davon tr umen hier zu sein wir werden hart mit der fifa daran arbeiten dass in zukunft die besten nachwuchsspieler bei olympia sind die klarheit h tte vor zwei drei monaten kommen m ssen
1687618 ich bedaure dass der cas den olympischen geist bei der entscheidung nicht ber cksichtigt hat
1687619 deep rooted conspiracy between the bomb blasts that took place in karnataka and gujarat and the cash for vote scam
1687620 that is i do not believe that theres such a thing as skill in security selection and i favour vehicles that transact as little as possible
1687621 because its well diversified biased towards small and value stocks and passive
1687622 i recommend very few adjustments in allocation very small changes opposite very large changes in valuation for example if the market rises or falls by a factor of two over a short period you might consider lowering or raising your equity allocation by a few per cent
1687623 i like his zest hes a smart guy he knows what to do he has good fundamentals hes a solid player hes got a good attitude about what hes doing
1687624 theres a lot more thinking a lot more line calls you have to put the entire offensive line on the same page thats where paying attention in meetings and watching olin kreutz helps
1687625 coach hiestand stresses he wants us to come out and be physical and come off the ball and get after it thats what poles has been trying to do
1687626 he might not be perfect all the time just like me last year you are green when you are a rookie you dont really know what to expect or what to do but you want to come on and work hard
1687627 we will give everybody an opportunity that we feel has a chance of helping us this year we will let them play and not let them play late in games were talking about early so we get a good read on exactly what they are
1687628 you get a chance to look at all of the players
1687629 but its also a big opportunity for someone like myself to step up and show what ive got there are so many veterans who arent getting reps on the line its an opportunity for me to show i can play at this level
1687630 they put me at center they put me at guard i have to show i can play both the more you know the better
1687631 youve just got to look good and youve got to play well no matter where you are at
1687632 i have no idea thats the tough thing i just have to be mentally prepared to play both who knows i could end up at tackle
1687633 i was given certain funds to work with and i wanted to do something different to promote and reward fast times
1687634 the festival of races there did something similar with open runners last year awarding 200 to men who ran sub 15 00 and 200 for women who cracked 16 50
1687635 i find courses that are marked in kilometer splits easier to run even pace on
1687636 i think its nicer at times because during the race you have more check points and those points are shorter so its easier to get feedback on your pacing i know many times runners naturally slow down between one mile and two miles having additional check points at 2k 1 2 miles and 3k 1 97 miles could make it somewhat helpful to avoid this lull
1687637 when i first tried getting use to the kilometer splits i was confused and didnt understand
1687638 but then i did some research and found a converter and realized if i wanted to run under 16 minutes i should be aiming for 3 05 3 10 per kilometer which is about 4 58 5 07 per mile
1687639 this race is a great opportunity for high school runners to do a fitness test right before their season starts and it gives them a chance to win a cool prize which will probably be helpful for the upcoming season
1687640 i am asking each of you to step up your efforts to increase savings i ask that you be creative and take action now
1687641 the high price of energy is hurting our businesses and our families anything we can do to reduce fuel consumption will ease the burden on our budget and on taxpayers
1687642 im glad that governor gregoire has started to recognize the budget crisis shes created she had to know that by increasing spending 33 percent in her first term she was heading the state toward a budget deficit
1687643 in addition to a hiring freeze we should also freeze salary increases for politically appointed state employees further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year
1687644 early morning trying to get the creative juices flowing before going to the studio while attempting to ignore the horrible stench in the air amp in the brown water caused by the local paper mill
1687645 this should be clear that this report is not just going to lie down put into some store somewhere its a report thats going to be used its a report that is going to help in bringing to justice or in making attempts very serious attempts to bring to justice people that were involved in committing genocide in this country
1687646 this is a story of much greater significance than just my sister or one woman her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1687647 everything interfaces with security influences it and is influenced by it we must remember that it will all be meaningless if israel should be weak vulnerable and surrounded by enemies
1687648 the report was aiming to assess the conservation status of all primates so 634 species and the findings of the report are very very worrying for the conservation of primates 48 percent were classified as being threatened with extinction and thats an unprecedented rate among species and groups of species that have been assessed in the past

1687652 in my mind there can only be one justification for abortion excluding medical necessity and rape womens primacy over her own body

1687654 when tv channels show an e mail from indian mujahideen they are misleading the people we should not pre judge anything let a fair investigations take place

1687659 apples 2 0 1 firmware update accomplishes what hackers had claimed apple couldnt do it relocks an iphone to at amp t the original boast was predicated on the fact that through all of its prior updates apple had never updated the baseband cellular radio firmware well 2 0 1 breaks this tradition and it breaks unlocking
1687660 weve come to realize that visual computing is a platform in its own right
1687661 without this ecosystem our hardware wont get used the way it should be
1687662 as well as engines for graphics that game startups use to get into the business there are hardware and software companies with applications ranging from airplane design to medical research to special effects animation
1687663 from 2007 to the first half of 2008 vulnerabilities affecting web server applications accounted for 51 percent of all vulnerability disclosures
1687664 without a unified process for disclosing vulnerabilities the research industry runs the risk of actually fueling online criminal activity
1687665 there is a reason why x force does not publish exploit code for the vulnerabilities we have found and perhaps it is time for others in our field to reconsider this practice
1687666 please dont spoil my clients and said there was a electricity failuer when there was no power failuer as the other pumps were working fine
1687667 we expect apple will consolidate its lead in the retail music market as cd sales continue to slow
1687668 amazons cd buyers tend to be older so they havent abandoned the cd format to the extent seen in the average music buyer
1687669 songs refrain it is clearly similar to super freak so probably falco borrowed it but whether hammer borrowed from both is hard to tell
1687670 lance is a pc guy he doesnt care about the mac
1687671 not for nothing but pc magazine has been covering the mac since 1984 we regularly test apple products and many of them win our editors choice award
1687672 if you found the percentage of billionaires and multiply that by the percentage of people who become olympic decathletes you could probably get a close estimate the really important thing is just how much a human being really can do theres such a huge range of performance and ability you can tap into

1687748 i have been teaching in a rural community where the poverty rate is hovering around 70 the teachers and children cant drink the water in the school building there is still lead paint in some of the older classrooms there is toxic mold and chilling cold all winter
1687749 the teachers in that building work harder and give more heart and soul to that community than any other teachers ive met yet there have been 5 principals in 7 years every year they are asked to go back to the community and do more with less to fix the broken child achieve gles be hqts and on and on and then be labeled as an identified school for nclb not only points out the inequalities in our school communities it takes a narrow look at the challenges of our communities living in poverty
1687750 how are families supposed to cope they are so concerned with heating their homes and finding work that education is on their back burner what will it take for our political parties to engage in this conversation authentically
1687751 i have yet to come across one educator who entered teaching with the strict desire to find what is broken with children and yet one of the overarching effects of nclb in prek 12 education head start is included now too
1687752 nclb and its sweeping and powerful aftershocks continues to point many toward who needs to be fixed in our classrooms who the heck decided our students were broken broken hearted maybe but broken and in need of repair no hopeful for us to sit with them and listen to their wisdom their connections the multiple and brilliant ways they make connections in what they are learning and their lives you betcha
1687753 start there and see what happens with our successes in the classroom our parent communities and our conversations beyond what ive learned from my work with young people is that our students just want us to show up in their lives like we do in our own

1687837 its a family concern theres a father and a son and they run everything
1687838 yes i suppose so no one knows just how much it takes but we never worry because theres never a shortage the boss always seems to have enough hes a very creative guy and the money is well just there in fact those of us in the organization have a saying about our boss he owns the cattle on a thousand hills
1687839 no its just a saying we use to indicate his wealth
1687840 they have a spirit that pervades the organization it works like this the father and son love each other so much that their love filters down through the organization so that we all find ourselves loving one another too i know this sounds old fashioned in a world like ours but i have people in the organisation who are willing to die for me do you have that in your business

1687887 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1687888 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1687889 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1687890 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1687891 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1687892 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1687893 this isnt exactly what i pictured of when i thought of medical school
1687894 the surgeons develop an increased efficiency less errors more fluid movement basically theyre just better
1687895 we can always tell the surgeons who are gamers because theyre naturally better
1687896 but what were finding with the wii is that the surgeons that use it regularly are achieving results that far outstrip those who have just gamed before and thats because the wii is very different
1687897 the whole point about surgery is to execute small finely controlled movements with your hands
1687898 then we saw people using the wii and noticed the precision of some movements looked very similar
1687899 you dont gain a lot from swinging an imaginary tennis racket
1687900 a laparoscope is inserted into the abdomen through small incisions theres a camera in the probe and surgeons work off monitors very small instruments are used and they are controlled by the smallest of hand movements
1687901 during minimally invasive surgeries there is reduced exposure of vital organs meaning a reduced risk of infection there is also reduced blood loss meaning reduced need for transfusions and patients can get out of hospital and back home sooner
1687902 in the countries i work in where risk of infection is high and supply of blood and beds is short any cheap development that can lead to fewer open procedures is incredibly exciting
1687903 but what makes it exciting are minds like dr kahol and smiths who look at everyday inexpensive technologies and think how could i use that
1687904 well i know i should really buy one for home but i still keep holding out hope that the hospital might give me one for research

1687915 just having a green roof may not mean anything in terms of preventing water from reaching the street level for instance
1687916 green roofs have to be done right and our hope is to help manufacturers understand how to improve their designs
1687917 thats a huge difference to have a 20 or so degree temperature drop
1687918 after you choose a manufacturer tell them what kind of plants and what other features you want
1687919 its up to them to then tailor the green roof to your needs
1687920 epa not only appears to have received limited information but worse epa is saying almost nothing about it

1687923 sepa anticipates that utilities will quickly become the largest and one of the most important customers for the solar industry
1687924 whether solar electric systems are developed by utilities their customers or solar companies the utilities proactive engagement with emerging solar technologies is important to the solar industry as a whole this market survey and resulting rankings provide a baseline against which increased utility activity can be measured in the future
1687925 these top 10 rankings highlight solar leading utilities that have put significant efforts into facilitating what have traditionally been customer based solar solutions
1687926 what has become apparent however is that over the next few years there will be an unprecedented level of new utility engagement in the solar industry that develops both centralized and distributed systems in new and unique ways several u s utilities some of whom arent in these rankings yet are positioning themselves to be the solar industries largest and most innovative customers

1687968 the things hoover believed in efficiency enterprise opportunity individualism substantial laissez faire personal success material welfare were all in the dominant american tradition the ideas he represented ideas that to so many people made him seem hateful or ridiculous after 1929 were precisely the same ideas that in the remotest past of the nineteenth century and the more immediate past of the new era had had an almost irresistible lure for the majority of americans

1687975 my view is that taking all the new data into account that there is really no material change in our expectations for the u s economy since i last reported to congress a couple weeks ago
1687976 if the housing sector begins to stabilize and if some of the inventory corrections that are still going on in manufacturing begin to be completed theres a reasonable possibility that well see some strengthening of the economy sometime during the middle of the year

1687983 confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1687984 we believe that the evening standards front page story today titled prince philip defies cancer scare is a serious breach of prince philips privacy
1687985 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
1687986 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1687987 we will continue to observe this long standing practice but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1687988 we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy and we will be taking this issue to the press complaints commission

1687993 there were alternative olympics set up in barcelona and they had gotten as far as printing the programs but then the spanish civil war broke out
1687994 the nazis they used those games in order to prove to their own people their international legitimacy
1687995 you may be seeing some parallels with the current games
1687996 there was a nonviolent protest and the government opened fire and killed about 250 people and the international olympic committee said this was a domestic issue and should not be addressed by the olympic movement
1687997 you can shoot down 250 people on the street but dont ruin our medal ceremony
1687998 people are completely oblivious to the fact that people were massacred in the streets of mexico city it shows how images and media can create our perception of a historical event
1687999 however that was an event that created its own history
1688000 if that hadnt happened you wouldnt associate the 1972 games with terrorism
1688001 the beijing olympics mark the moment in human history when china which is farthest from the political centers of the west both culturally and geographically is incorporated into the world system to a degree never seen before
1688002 because of the intense interaction and high level of collaboration with the outside world required to organize the olympic games many chinese people are just now realizing that their old way of doing things did not reach international standards and that they did not understand the west as well as they thought they did
1688003 the impression they make on the rest of the world is secondary
1688004 whats important is to show their own people the 95 percent who arent communists that the rest of the world acknowledges the communist party as the legitimate leader of china
1688005 if the u s president will stand next to their leader thats fine

1688022 why should i react to it i dont have any take on this could it be for reasons related to numerology if its numerology i hope it works for her

1688051 replogle was founded the same year frank lloyd wright was turning 63 he continued to practice nearly until his death at 91 amazing the world with his architectural ingenuity and designs his unified creative vision encompassed the buildings and residences he designed as well as their landscaping art glass furniture lighting and floor coverings today his genius and timelessness endure in our globes
1688052 we immediately felt comfortable with replogles commitment to the design sales and marketing that would be required to make this a successful product line
1688053 we think that mr wright had an admiration for globes we had not thought about this as a product line until we found the original sketch drawing of the globe stand mr wright designed this stand was never produced privately or commercially the inquiry by replogle to the frank lloyd wright foundation initiated the process to add this product to our authorized licensing program
1688054 we are very excited to have replogle globes as an official and authorized licensee the globe stands they produce will be a great compliment to the furniture and other decorative products from our frank lloyd wright collection product line
1688055 replogle is honored to produce this new line of globes its fitting that our two organizations with large global visions should combine to produce a new line of world globe models that are reproductions and adaptations of the renowned architects designs
1688056 each globes design is exact to frank lloyd wrights designs each piece identically matches the dimension and geometry of the furniture its based upon the richly stained maple and oak wood species were carefully chosen to replicate the prairie period every stand like every globe its holds is a hand made work of art
1688057 the replogle prototype and production teams attention to detail was impeccable and we are extremely pleased with the quality
1688058 the frank lloyd wright globe stand is an actual reproduction and interpretation of mr wrights design and it turned out exactly as was originally intended based on the drawing
1688059 just after replogle became a licensee and they were working on the first five prototypes i made a trip to the price tower in bartlesville oklahoma while touring the building we entered the office that was occupied by mr price in a triangular corner across from his desk was a large globe resting on a trapazoid copper stand designed by mr wright the story goes that mr price wanted a large wall map placed in his office mr wright convinced him that he should have a beautiful globe and stand to match the other design elements in the room instead well mr wright prevailed as we rotated the original globe we noticed the manufacturer was replogle globes it was like an endorsement
1688060 each globe is steeped in history provocative representations of americana while communicating the universal appeal of wrights work
1688061 wrights style is as much contemporary as it is traditional fitting into almost any design scheme furthering this breadth of possibilities the globes in this collection are both large enough to serve as a rooms focal point and small enough to serve as decorative accent pieces while remaining functional and inspirational

1688065 in the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided for in our extended package we think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive
1688066 i think that the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies so i think the most important thing we can do is let the political directors have their conference call and decide on their next steps
1688067 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1688068 we dont have the decent and responsive statement from the iranians
1688069 the question posed is clear and calls for a simple answer does iran accept the
1688070 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1688071 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
1688072 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes

1688074 todays announcement marks a responsible and measured approach by the government to ensure canadas housing market remains strong and to reduce the risk of a u s style housing bubble developing in canada
1688075 weve seen an inclination now a trend toward longer term amortizations and smaller down payments and that is a matter of some concern
1688076 i think you have a clear case of the government sitting down and looking at its risk exposure and wanting to review that
1688077 cmhc supports the new parameters we also support their efforts to maintain the strong canadian housing market
1688078 why get people overextended nobody wins by getting people right to the end of the cliff
1688079 things here are not like they are in the u s where they had those ninja loans no income no job no assets its only going to hurt the consumer
1688080 its a bit like closing the barn door after the horse has already run down the road
1688081 ive seen part of the operation and it is impressive downside is that it makes it harder to check quality of building mattamy sold me a house without electrical power and illegally wired code the furnace to the house next door putting my family with two small children at risk
1688082 its a tough market and you have to do things over and above to get a home sold these days so we threw it out there
1688083 for the right property as long as you have a willing buyer and seller it can really enhance your marketing efforts
1688084 for young urban buyers its just perfect but you really dont get to experience that when you just go in during daylight hours so the thought of spending the night in a property would allow them to go out to dinner enjoy some nightlife and walk home and you can only experience that in an overnight stay
1688085 the home gets a wonderful sunset view that he got to experience he got to experience the mornings there the clouds set down in the mountains and the stars at night which you can see here and you cant in a lot of cities

1688089 sales were down 18 per cent from the 2007 total of 10 451 which was the best performance ever for that month
1688090 nevertheless the 8 600 figure is the fifth best june on record and indicative of an active healthy market
1688091 with summer coming and a 22 per cent increase in inventory to nearly 27 000 this june over last
1688092 the canadian recreational property market has been notoriously short of supply for several years
1688093 but dont expect to see bargain basement prices or fire sales
1688094 the recreational market continues to experience solid demand a trend that is expected to continue throughout 2008 the influx of new listings has yet to translate into downward pressure on recreational property prices prime waterfront properties while more plentiful than in years past will still command top dollar
1688095 however at this price point it will be rare for these properties to have water access
1688096 the housing meltdown in the u s combined with a canadian dollar at par created serious investment opportunities for properties in florida arizona texas and california
1688097 this is the dominant difference between the canadian and u s experience
1688098 indeed the u s has been characterized by an abnormal rise in delinquencies and foreclosures or large negative equity positions in canada speculators may be quickly dumping properties on the market to get out while the times are good but individuals that have a principal dwelling are not under financial duress this distinction is crucial to evaluating the impact of weaker home price performance on personal wealth and consumption canadian consumers are nowhere nearly as leveraged through their home equity as american consumers are
1688099 there was no initiation of fire from our side at all
1688100 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
1688101 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1688102 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran the six countries are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another resolution
1688103 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic

1688125 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1688126 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1688127 i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1688128 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
1688129 and of course there are added sensitivities with our faith given the
1688130 im pleased by the overall performance of our businesses so far this year particularly in light of the challenging economic environment and that were on track to achieve our business outlook
1688131 this resilience reflects the strength of our brands our expertise and our scale which we think give us a sustained advantage in creating packaging and distributing the industrys most compelling content such as the dark knight sex and the city and the closer
1688132 i am so uninterested in aggression and so comfortable with this situation that i can yawn
1688133 apart from the large size of the recent capital increase key question marks continue to hang over global risks control as well as efficiency of capital allocated per activity the analysts said
1688134 at present we do not see how aig could quickly reduce its large exposure to the subprime market as well as to the financial market as a whole
1688135 i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement id be as surprised as anybody else
1688136 i dont think its the kind of thing you say no to andrea the answer to that is yes i love my day job im not looking to change but if someone who will be leading the country comes to you and says i need your help i want you to do this of course if you care about serving your country that is the kind of thing that you do
1688137 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1688138 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1688139 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1688140 this speech puts together what the president has been saying for seven and a half years but does it in a very focused way
1688141 is one of the most important relationships that we have in the united states and the speech is being given on the eve of his trip there so he thought it was appropriate to talk about it at this point
1688142 absurd to try to sustain the claim that americas policies are principled while then effectively standing back and saying we will watch from the sidelines while the chinese do what they do
1688143 what is happening in anambra state is like tsunami i want to take record of all erosion site in the state so that when we talk about the problem people will see it
1688144 we will even present it to the united nations un and ensure that we attract internaitonal donors and also to the federal government to support us
1688145 we expect a high level of transparency and accountability from the people who will manage the foundation and we know that those problems are caused by climate change and global warming
1688146 happens is that that fund is tranfered to the presidency through the secretary to the federal government sfg which is not right
1688147 so we are now say that this thing cannot continue like this we want to the prsident and told him that we must have a law like the niger delta development commission nddc that will take care of the application of the ecological fund the bill is now on the its second reading in the senate
1688148 all the observed loopeholes in the operation of the ecological fund are what we are trying to correct in the bill
1688149 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1688150 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1688151 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1688152 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1688153 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1688154 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1688155 baden baden ist auch mit dem spielgeld der russen so sch n geworden

1688158 i wouldnt necessarily make the conclusion that just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer that that provides a smoking gun that he must be using this for sinister purposes
1688159 i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury
1688160 and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr ivins they ought to see that as well
1688161 we were disturbed to learn that china has refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously
1688162 i asked for a reason and they said we dont give reasons
1688163 i said who else can i speak to about this and they said there is no other recourse
1688164 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists
1688165 but these are legitimate olympians with a history with the olympics id sure like to know what the international olympic committee has to say about this i think its really disappointing
1688166 these findings of a significant association between perceived racial or ethnic based medical discrimination and cancer screening behaviors have serious implications for cancer health disparities
1688167 we cannot know whether the reported events represented actual discriminatory acts or if perception of discrimination was accurate clearly more research is needed to confirm these initial findings and to explain the gender differences as well as to explore important subgroup differences
1688168 some persons may delay or avoid getting screened for cancers and that this delay may be associated with racial or ethnic based experiences they encounter within the medical setting
1688169 perceived medical discrimination and cancer screening behaviors of racial and ethnic minority adults
1688170 i said i was happy to be a reserve so i knew i would be in limbo and that it would be hard
1688171 ive been told to train as if im going to the olympics and thats what im doing ill be ready if i do get called up and if i dont ill be fit for a marathon in the autumn
1688172 ive had so many injuries over the years that i really know what paulas been going through and i feel for her
1688173 i know what its like to build up your hopes and have them thwarted and wouldnt wish that on anyone else
1688174 when i was younger my dream was always to compete at the olympics but i had so many injuries that id given up hope
1688175 if youd told me a year or 18 months ago that id be a reserve for beijing i wouldnt have believed you
1688176 i have cross trained for a cross country race a few years ago and was surprised at how fit i got that shows you dont have to train just by pounding out miles on the road
1688177 innovative companies are exploring opportunities for expanding mobile messaging access to web sites as well as targeting customers with content and ads
1688178 to be successful with these enhanced services companies that supply mobile messaging products and services must understand the regional distributions for customer type payment preferences message delivery method and usage
1688179 we are instructing drivers not to idle for more than three minutes
1688180 from what we have seen over the past 12 months and what we are hearing in the media i would expect that we will go over the 2008 budgeted monies during the next year
1688181 would withhold federal funds from any school that lets students sing the star spangled banner or say the pledge of allegiance in a language other than english
1688182 the lack of access to psychiatric care is creating a very dangerous situation for people with mental illness and for emergency patients in general
1688183 theres a growing number of people with mental illness in the state
1688184 its a shared problem it impacts the hospitals the sheriffs departments the mental hospitals it impacts all of us
1688185 we have rampant overcrowding people are going to emergency rooms because thats where you can get care
1688186 if we dont have beds for people coming into the emergency room we still accommodate them
1688187 we still assess them and get them referred to the appropriate facilities
1688188 our dilemma is having to hold an individual until a bed is available
1688189 deutschland ist von einer rezession weit entfernt die entwicklung in den ersten monaten des jahres war sehr stark deshalb stemmt sich der bdi gegen das schlechtreden der stimmung

1688197 diese entscheidung haben wir aufgrund der sach und rechtslage erwartet
1688198 die fifa hat es leichtfertig verpasst fr hzeitig die geltende rechtslage anzuerkennen
1688199 wir haben keine offizielle mitteilung bekommen die spieler bleiben teil des teams und werden gegen belgien spielen
1688200 messi will das ganze olympische turnier spielen er ist f r die startelf vorgesehen
1688201 die fifa ist berrascht und entt uscht ber die entscheidung aber wir respektieren sie dennoch ich appelliere an die vereine lasst eure spieler teilnehmen es w re ein akt der solidarit t in perfekter bereinstimmung mit dem olympischen geist zudem w re es wunderbar f r die spieler die fans und f r den fu ball insgesamt
1688202 ich finde es gro artig dass mir der verein die m glichkeit gibt an olympia teilzunehmen und sich die sehr komplizierte situation damit entspannt
1688203 ich bedaure dass der cas den olympischen geist bei der entscheidung nicht ber cksichtigt hat
1688204 ich habe nie wissentlich gedopt aber nach den unterlagen kann ich heute leider nicht mehr ausschlie en dass ich von den rzten ohne mein zutun und wissen mit illegalen mitteln behandelt wurde

1688209 der umgang mit ihrem tod war f r die familie eine riesige belastung
1688210 trotz unterschiedlicher auffassungen musste ich auch akzeptieren dass mein bruder ich und unsere familien nicht zu seiner zweiten hochzeit eingeladen waren
1688211 ich gebe zu dass mich diese vorgehensweise damals befremdet hat
1688212 der umgang mit ihrem tod war f r die familie eine riesige belastung da ein selbstmord immer zu viele fragen offen l sst
1688213 heute bin ich frei heute kann ich sagen ich bin ich ich bin walter kohl
1688214 kurz gesagt mein leben war in gro en phasen von ungerechtigkeiten und belastungen gepr gt denen mein bruder und ich machtlos gegen berstanden ich f hlte mich ob dieser erlebnisse und erfahrungen jahrelang innerlich tief verletzt und reagierte bis vor ein paar jahren mit zorn und wut das war ein fehler

1688221 ich denke das ist systematisches doping das w re im neuen wada code ein vergehen das zu einer vierj hrigen sperre f hren k nnte
1688222 wir sind in einer schwierigen situation aber uns systematisches doping zu unterstellen ist vorverurteilung
1688223 als in den usa der balco skandal bekannt wurde hat doch auch niemand gesagt der ganze us sport sei darin verstrickt

1688227 im moment wissen wir noch nicht ob das vorkommen von perchlorat eine gute oder schlechte nachricht f r die mars expedition ist
1688228 aber wir m ssen uns nun gedanken dar ber machen wie wir uns leben auf dem mars vorstellen
1688229 das sind zum jetzigen zeitpunkt allerdings nur spekulationen so michael hecht einer der nasa chefanalytiker
1688230 noch wissen wir nicht ob die zwei teel ffel voll marserde die bedingungen auf dem gesamten oder zumindest einem gro en teil des nachbarplaneten widerspiegeln
1688231 h tten wir das gas nachgewiesen k nnten wir uns absolut sicher sein dass es perchlorid auf dem mars gibt

1688235 in den n chsten beiden spielen geht es jetzt um alles wir brauchen siege sonst war der punkt heute viel zu wenig jeder muss seinen teil dazu beitragen dann schaffen wir das auch
1688236 our performance on friday was reasonable the performance on saturday in qualifying was good to very good but our performance in the race was completely different
1688237 it looked like we werent there that the race went on without us
1688238 at no point did robert or nick come close to the lap times they did in qualifying and i have to admit i dont know the reason yet
1688239 what we certainly will look into is the equation of car set up tyres and track conditions
1688240 if you look at roberts qualifying time he should have been able to fight at the front but in reality in certain phases of the race he was the slowest car on the track
1688241 in the last two years weve been on the podium
1688242 so there must be another explanation behind this disappointing performance we were not just slow we were also inconsistent
1688243 like at ferrari we also witnessed one car was doing much better than the other there was something out there we did not understand
1688244 based on the performance and points yield of the budapest weekend youd say we could not regain second place
1688245 but naturally we will not twiddle our thumbs as we still have developments in the pipeline aerodynamic as well as mechanical
1688246 i dont want to deny that the last races didnt go as i wanted every time something strange happened and we didnt manage to find the best possible set up for the car
1688247 we tried to find a good compromise but it didnt help weve got to solve that problem now for the upcoming race at valencia the qualifying was the decisive moment also at budapest in a negative way
1688248 this short break comes at the right time we have to recharge our batteries after six months of giving it all racing and testing so were ready for the next race and for the finale of the season
1688249 hubi pa auf dich auf du sollst mal kanzler werden
1688250 opponieren und intrigieren d rfen wie sie gerade lustig waren
1688251 firstly i was so pleased for heikki he deserved this victory and it was great to celebrate with him and the rest of the team afterwards for me it was an unusual race i didnt expect felipe to be so strong particularly in the first stint and i was pushing the whole way to keep up with him the car wasnt at its best in the opening laps but after the first stop i was able to stabilise the gap and start clawing it back bit by bit until i had the tyre problem
1688252 it was a sudden puncture it must have occurred at turn one and the tyre was flat by turn two so i had to travel a long way back to the pits at reduced speed after that i needed to look after the super soft tyre because i had a longer than expected final stint to the flag but the car felt good and i just kept pushing until the finish and picked up a useful handful of points after a day like that youve got to look at the big picture and given the problem we had with the tyre and the difficulty looking after the car in the final stint i cant really complain about finishing fifth salvaging the maximum possible points from a difficult race is always important with the championship as tight as it is you cant afford to drop too many points so i cant be too disappointed to have come away from a difficult race like that having extended my lead in the world championship
1688253 ive had a busy few months ive worked hard both on and off the track and while ive enjoyed it done some brilliant things and been to some amazing places im looking forward to having some time to myself for the next few weeks i dont have any work commitments so i can literally be on my own and spend time with my family and friends ill be using the time up any way i want to but itll basically be a mixture of total relaxation and in the second half of the break intense training i love training and i find it a good way of relaxing
1688254 proper recovery is very important for the first few days after hungary im just going to rest and recover get as much sleep as possible and then start focusing on a certain area of my body that perhaps needs more attention than others ill continue to work on my cardio fitness too do some running and cycling the constant travelling and racing does take its toll on your body and my aim is to make sure i start the second half of the season feeling as fit as when i started the year in melbourne
1688255 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team it showed us in no uncertain terms that we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia you can never under estimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident that we wont be taking anything for granted i know that everybody in woking stuttgart and brixworth will be working flat out to make sure we can be strong in all the remaining races
1688256 ive had a look at some onboard footage of the track and will be working with the team over the break to prepare for the event from the footage the track looks amazing i love street circuits but this circuit looks extremely fast and unforgiving in some places as a driver its always fun to come to a new circuit i really enjoy driving at new places and feel confident i can pick up new circuits quickly it looks like being an amazing event
1688257 were so inclined towards traditional first world markets and the real commercial excitement generated is coming from eastern economies

1688260 john mccain is looking for someone for vice president who has more economic expertise than he does so congratulations to all of you youre on the short list
1688261 her own exhortation to her supporters plus the sense of urgency about doing everything we can to help barack obama become the next president of the united states has motivated an awful lot of us
1688262 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way
1688263 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people
1688264 what was good about this was that we got everybody involved

1688266 theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1688267 were not going to run a campaign like he did in the primary every time somebody brings up a challenge to who you are and what you believe youre a racist thats not going to happen in this campaign
1688268 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist
1688269 i am happy to have won the league as acting head coach but what impresses me more is my ability to defeat teams that are coached by male coaches

1688274 water was rushing down the main road and the road was flooded
1688275 there was a whoosh of water and a geyser effect
1688276 there was crashing from the kitchen as water dislodged pots plans and moved furniture the furniture blocked his egress from out of the kitchen
1688277 i was really frightened he was going to drown i kept shouting but there was no response
1688278 he was soaked but i didnt know if he had been in the water or was just wet due to rain
1688279 i supported him under his armpits his head at no time went under water
1688280 we lifted him into the boat with help from a neighbour we conveyed him to dry land
1688281 we are happy about prof sherwin nacuas release the other day but most of us still fear for our own safety here
1688282 aside from our security concerns we are very much disturbed because under the prevailing situation most of the faculty members as well as the students are planning to move to other schools
1688283 the vessel has reached the so called position where the master had to take his extra ordinary diligence and must undertake his overriding authority as we call it to take evasive action to save the vessel and the lives of the crew and passengers on board but in a way he failed
1688284 to make things worse it was also indubitably established that the accused overpriced the construction supplies and materials in the amount of p512 967 69 to the disadvantage and prejudice of the government
1688285 public officers with special technical knowledge and trainings hence must be accorded great weight in all aspects
1688286 the prosecution was able to prove with testimonial and documentary evidence taken individually and collectively that unravel the chain of processes that show the involvement of all the accused in a scheme successfully maneuvered by the concerted efforts of these public officers led by accused nava who was holding the highest position to defraud the coffers of the government
1688287 it is safe to conclude that the mayors bodyguard was clandestinely in connivance with the killers
1688288 the manner of the killing considering the numbers of calls received by the mayor before the commission of the crime and the movement of the vehicle from a drug store to the gasoline refilling station could have been neatly arranged and set up

1688294 we did not know that the government of mauritius has signed a declaration to commit itself that by 2005 there should be 30 women in politics
1688295 irrespective of the sadc declaration we are prepared to take up the challenge and we are ashamed to see that there are so few women in politics
1688296 she is well surrounded and we respect her and protect her a lot
1688297 there are two women councillors in my village and whenever our meetings finish late or there is a function in our village i make it a point to leave them in front of their doors in my taxi mauritius is becoming a dangerous place and women cannot walk alone at night
1688298 i did not even realise that by giving them free transport at night i am also encouraging them to keep up their good work at village councils until i attended your workshop on gender
1688299 i am a taxi driver working with tourists in a five star hotel i lost two days salary by attending this gender workshop but i do not regret it as two days salary is nothing compared to what i have learnt
1688300 i know they have always been side lined due to their multiple roles
1688301 i still remember how my neighbour was getting up at 4 00 a m preparing breakfast for the family then fetched grass for the cows milked the cows before going in the sugar cane field to work as a labourer after work she came back home to cook and look after the house she was the last one to eat and she ate on her own very often her husband came back drunk and beat her for no reason at all i have even heard him saying that there is too much salt or not enough salt in the food and she got a good beating for that
1688302 we are ten children in my family and very often my dad came home drunk and for no reason at all he would beat my mother it is time that we all give a helping hand to prevent domestic violence
1688303 all my children two girls and one boy get the same treatment i am building a house for my son at the moment and as soon as i have saved enough money i will build for my two girls as well

1688313 i believe it is important for political parties to try to maintain the highest political standards so voters can have faith in the integrity of our system
1688314 so if chairman rivera believes jack davis broke the law i applaud him for coming forward but if he really believes in honesty and integrity he will return the tens of thousands of dollars he has taken from the man he now describes as a lawbreaker

1688316 this was the gist of the notice it said the guide is definitive reality is frequently inaccurate
1688317 this has led to some interesting consequences for instance when the editors of the guide were sued by the families of those who had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet traal literally it said ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal for visiting tourists instead of ravenous bugblatter beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists they claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more aesthetically pleasing summoned a qualified poet to testify under oath that beauty was truth truth beauty and hoped thereby to prove that the guilty party in this case was life itself for failing to either be beautiful or true beyond truth beyond beauty or must the path from truth to beauty leave one feeling soiled definitively inaccurate

1688324 el pspv tiene como objetivo prioritario conseguir la reducci n de residuos algo que se puede lograr con campa as de concienciaci n y sensibilizaci n hacia la poblaci n
1688325 es algo a lo que las empresas contratadas para la limpieza diaria y recogida de residuos se comprometieron en 2005
1688326 a pesar de esto hasta este momento s lo existen los que est n en patraix y en la calle leones los cuales llevan mucho tiempo
1688327 este es un compromiso que realizaron las empresas de limpieza y hasta ahora no han creado ninguno
1688328 a n quedar a por se alar en que lugar en el que se deber a construir el tercero
1688329 la alcaldesa dijo que quer a construir cuatro uno en cada punto cardinal pero lo que exigimos al grupo popular es que agilice cuanto antes la puesta en marcha de estos emplazamientos porque permitir an la recogida selectiva de productos dom sticos con cierta peligrosidad y una mayor limpieza en las calles
1688330 a pesar de que la ciudad se ha ampliado tan s lo hay de media una papelera por cada 65 habitantes
1688331 esto demuestra que aunque injustamente las papeleras no se distribuyen dependiendo de la poblaci n ni en igual proporci n en toda la ciudad
1688332 que sirvan para concienciar a la gente sobre la reducci n de basuras
1688333 en los ltimos a os las campa as realizadas por el partido popular son poco ambiciosas poco intensas y les falta un mejor dise o
1688334 de los cerca de 600 000 euros que se destinan a publicidad 100 000 euros son utilizados para stands en expojove con la finalidad de llamar la atenci n en la recogida selectiva
1688335 el resto son d pticos tr pticos campa as para la recogida de excrementos caninos o cu as de publicidad en alguna emisora pero nos parece que se podr a hacer algo m s

1688351 el ayuntamiento est en todo momento en colaboraci n con la conselleria para actuar de manera urgente cuando aparece una plaga de este estilo que pueda suponer un problema para los ciudadanos y el entorno natural de nuestro t rmino municipal
1688352 consistir en la retirada manual de las acequias del jacinto de agua una especie originaria de la cuenca amaz nica que es la causa de graves problemas ecol gicos y de salud humana
1688353 el da o en la salud puede surgir porque las formaciones de esta especie son el medio id neo para la proliferaci n de mosquitos adem s de que es una especie invasora que puede llegar a generar p rdidas econ micas
1688354 en esta actuaci n se van a seguir escrupulosamente sistemas naturales de erradicaci n que no perjudiquen el medio ambiente porque la retirada se producir de manera manual y sin utilizar ning n tipo de herbicida que puede ser contraproducente con el entorno
1688355 la buena acogida dispensada durante el pasado mes de julio al bibliob s municipal demuestra que para los ba istas y usuarios de las playas ha sido un servicio muy apreciado y demandado sus ratos de ocio en la playa se han visto enriquecidos con el disfrute de la cultura
1688356 emulando las actividades que regularmente se realizan en las bibliotecas municipales dispone cada d a de un cuentacuentos que ameniza las tardes a los m s peque os
1688357 no es suficiente para los valores contables de sus obras
1688358 siendo la tendencia en todos los museos del mundo contraria a contratar dicha cobertura
1688359 no se ha podido facilitar un listado por elementos y ubicaci n ni un resumen global que permita asegurar el control y la supervisi n del mismo en todo momento
1688360 viene a poner de manifiesto que algo est fallando en materia de pol tica industrial en la comunitat
1688361 cuando el sector de la construcci n est pasando por serias dificultades que afectan claramente al mercado de trabajo
1688362 en aras de potenciar alternativas productivas capaces de generar empleo y riqueza en la comunitat

1688367 tiene que actuar con lealtad y en colaboraci n con la generalitat
1688368 no es una novedad porque hace meses que se dijo
1688369 hay una partida finalista y expresa en los presupuestos para la firma del convenio
1688370 lejos de criticar al que quiere ayudar al gobierno de manera leal lo que tiene que hacer es colaborar para agilizar una firma que a quien m s interesa es al estado
1688371 en vez de hablar m s habr a que trabajar m s

1688376 tan s lo reconoce las realizadas por valor de 209 000 euros

1688378 la falta de espacio hace que utilicen una misma sala como biblioteca aula de inform tica y de direcci n
1688379 s lo hay una forma de hacer las cosas hacerlas bien
1688380 en vez de disculparse se dedica a echar tierra sobre las relaciones hist ricas con esta ciudad y a descalificar al partido socialista

1688382 a cuyo acto por su trig simo aniversario no ha acudido ning n representante del equipo de gobierno
1688383 demuestran que el n mero de visitantes recibidos entre enero y mayo ha bajado casi un 10 por ciento respecto al mismo periodo del a o anterior
1688384 parece que le haya molestado que el pspv hable de turismo y parece que a n le hayan molestado m s las propuestas positivas y concretas
1688385 no destin un euro a la ampliaci n de las instalaciones en los ocho a os que estuvo al frente del gobierno de espa a

1688387 for most of the 20th century missouri was one of americas political bellwethers it has voted for every presidential winner but one eisenhower in 1956 since 1900 from the 1960s to the 1990s it mirrored national trends by moving its congressional politics from pretty solidly democratic to leaning republican
1688388 if claire wins this toss up race it is likely that democrats eyeing the 2008 candidacy for president will take notice of her rural strategy given the recent grim history of democratic electoral defeats in states with large rural populations its a strategy worth serious consideration
1688389 if you are looking for a single state that is a metaphor for the nation you would be hard pressed to find a better metaphor than missouri
1688390 deep in south central missouri where wooded cattle farms mingle with wal marts jesus billboards dot the highways radio runs from rush limbaugh to dr laura and carrying a concealed weapon is legal a rebellion is brewing against republicans
1688391 both candidates have that problem of connecting with rural voters
1688392 meanwhile in various states scientific issues are turning up on important ballot initiatives in missouri a high profile measure would amend the state constitution to protect stem cell research
1688393 i will put anything in a trust that needs to be put in a trust to make sure that there are no ethical questions

1688395 en el problema del dise o de una red cada p jaro codifica una posible red con todas sus tuber as de determinados di metros y otros elementos y con un coste asociado determinado

1688404 was not a question of principle it was a question of tactics
1688405 i cant pretend that im brave and that i can beat the whole world
1688406 wait a minute chaps some good may come of this
1688407 i went to see him to tell him what are you doing it was an unbelievable initiative he took a massive risk
1688408 once you arrive at the beachhead then you allow the people to move on hes not a bubble gum leader chew it now and throw it away
1688409 as if there arent enough lawyers out there inventing lawsuits now were going to invite the public to do so
1688410 i think this is nothing more than a referral service
1688411 it encourages if not creates lawsuits our countrys courts are clogged with unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits which delay if not obstruct the access to courts of people that really need to get there that have serious legal grievances
1688412 with our system they can either find a lawyer or find out by talking to our lawyers that they dont really have an interest in that case
1688413 i dont think whocanisue com is going to by itself increase the number of lawsuits there are but it may make people more aware of what their rights are
1688414 its a good thing to the extent people are vindicating their legal rights to the extent they didnt years ago
1688415 conforma una infraestructura b sica que en caso de producirse un incendio permita una actuaci n r pida segura y eficaz de los medios de extinci n
1688416 para reforzar el mantenimiento de estas zonas se ha buscado la utilizaci n de sistemas alternativos como el pastoreo controlado entendido ste como elemento de control del exceso de vegetaci n y que se desarrolla mediante un r gimen de subvenciones al que pueden acceder los ganaderos
1688417 la nueva presi n a la baja de los precios en origen
1688418 contribuya a dar una mayor transparencia a la cadena agroalimentaria
1688419 garantizar un precio justo para todos los agentes de la cadena incluidos los productores
1688420 they were very eager to take the right action which was to apologize to their hosts
1688421 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1688422 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1688423 we offer our sincere apologies to bocog the city of beijing and the people of if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent
1688424 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1688425 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1688426 we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1688427 you never want to go to somebody elses place and cause any embarrassment and in this case some of them did
1688428 were not chastizing anybody they came forward of their own volition
1688429 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1688430 they were overly cautious those athletes have written an apology to bocog
1688431 we believe hopefully this will be the last incident of this kind
1688432 this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1688433 im saying not to kill innocent animals theres nothing negative that goes into that
1688434 i go to the office in a swim suit im comfortable with shedding a few more items of clothing i dont think its too crazy or risque
1688435 you have concerns im not out here taking my clothes off were doing it in a very positive way
1688436 im not trying to be in everybodys face and be harsh or negative i want to be calm and yet get my voice out there im doing it for all those animals who dont have a voice
1688437 i think some people were scared of what this might become
1688438 i think they tried censorship but it was not successful amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced
1688439 im hopeful things will change here but im not optimistic this is a message for the world
1688440 but things are changing five years ago you would never have considered doing things like this
1688441 the chinese team is in good condition but its not as easy as it was when only the
1688442 i think the pressure on them is too high with all the eyes of china on them sometimes we chinese expect too much i will be happy if they make the top four
1688443 i keep saying im not sure if this is true or not true im making the team and now im the first guy coming to the stadium and the whole world will be watching me carry the flag there are no words to describe it
1688444 in america everyone has a chance to do all these things
1688445 you follow the rules people will choose and if im blessed to get that opportunity ill get it
1688446 this course is very very very difficult i feel exhausted because its difficult everywhere you never have five meters to relax
1688447 the water changes so much that every time you come down its different its new water and the water flows differently
1688448 this is the most difficult artificial course in the world
1688449 even for the top guys they wouldnt feel comfortable of nailing it so theres room for the underdog to come through here
1688450 the way the course is configured you just take a lot of hits on the way down
1688451 speed and strength will be less important than good boat control
1688452 with this kind of difficulty of the course i think everybody will have mistakes i dont think theyll be a perfect run
1688453 david douillet told me not to go to the opening ceremony because it means standing up for three hours i need to conserve my energy so i dont want to take any risk i want to stay in my bubble and stay focused
1688454 having lost my grandmother to cancer its not an easy battle and i know his goal was to swim at the olympic games and hes doing that
1688455 hes positive and hes excited to be here and were all supporting each other in everything we do and he seems like just a normal guy
1688456 eric has been quite inspiring in many ways the way hes handled this has put all this into perspective for all of us weve taken a step back and realised there is more to it than just swimming
1688457 he gives you a sense of the bigger picture look a lot smaller when youre dealing with something like cancer
1688458 its been pretty easy to keep focused a lot of times when we get to an event like this you put a lot of pressure on yourself
1688459 ive probably got an out with cancer that puts things into perspective for me theres a lot more to life than just the olympic games
1688460 when you look at what he did after he was diagnosed and treated for it you cant help but be inspired by that
1688461 the goal now is to win the gold medal that beijing organizers will hand out august 20
1688462 youve got to train like you are on a mission to take him out
1688463 i hung in there and i eventually caught up and mastered the workouts
1688464 i also grew as an athlete now i am more diligent i work harder and i am more patient
1688465 it was personally devastating to see what happened to her
1688466 i feel a greater responsibility to be clean it would have been great if my role model could have been clean and still been my role model
1688467 if unchecked drugs threaten to choke the life out of the sport
1688468 i have a moral obligation to do my best to beat drugs to the punch and metaphorically choke the life out of drugs drug cheats and their enablers
1688469 its even more of a blow to athletes who are trying to do it the right way it affected sponsorships a lot of companies didnt want to take a chance on athletes who might test positive these are opportunities missed
1688470 i believe far more sponsors would be more enthusiastic about us if they got the sense there is a moral indignation and a commitment to really manhandle drugs to get them out of our sport
1688471 dope cheats didnt do a bad thing for themselves they did a bad thing for the games
1688472 if more stuff comes out what we will try to do is focus on our races and put on the blinders and let everybody know this is the us team and we have decided to do it clean
1688473 were pretty confident were clean were making up for other peoples past misdeeds
1688474 i think the general public views them with some nuance of skepticism
1688475 some people will not forgive when they feel they have been lied to
1688476 the economy is simply too weak to withstand a rate increase
1688477 labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1688478 at least its not going to be as steady a run up as it looked for so long
1688479 i think the fed should have signaled that it is more worried about inflation than a lack of growth
1688480 could be to depress economic growth by taking away buying power from the consumer whose wages have not kept up with inflation
1688481 certainly i expect they are going to raise interest rates before the end of the year
1688482 the player is here and will remain with the team he will start thursdays game against ivory coast in shanghai from the beginning and im sure he can be with us for the rest of the competition
1688483 not at this time no i have spoken with him and he wants to stay here with the rest of the team
1688484 i hope this decision will not have any effects on other teams with players who are coming to this tournament every coach would want messi in their team hopefully barcelona can take the decision that he stays here
1688485 surprised and disappointed by the cas decision but we respect it
1688486 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympics it would be an act of solidarity in perfect harmony with the olympic spirit it would be wonderful for the players for the fans and for the game itself
1688487 fifas opinion has not changed the olympic football tournaments are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1688488 it stands to reason therefore that it is not only the player who will benefit from such an experience but also his club i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration
1688489 we are pleased with the cas decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1688490 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1688491 it is sad for the athletes concerned they were dreaming of the games but obviously there are some issues between the players and the clubs
1688492 in this horrible situation who can say ill even be alive in 2012
1688493 a lot of my friends neighbors people i work with in the sports world have been abducted hijacked or even killed
1688494 even when her mum used to ask her to get some stuff from the shops she would go running for it it was all built in
1688495 until this there was nothing exciting that ever happened in beijing
1688496 the big malls i do worry it will effect our business
1688497 but i believe if you need a smoke you dont go to a mall youll come to the closest place
1688498 its a long term effort and were making an effort
1688499 the games have done much to improve air quality the traffic status and the overall way the city is run
1688500 peoples minds have to change to protect the environment to improve their behavior you have to change the mind first
1688501 let the world know that the chinese have a great determination to do the changes for us this is just a start to show the whole world
1688502 the chinese culture has so many small customs i hope the world will see
1688503 even as the western culture is rushing in the chinese culture is overwhelming
1688504 we want to use the good of the west and use it in the way of our life
1688505 it is positive to experience the negative attention from the rest of the world because it will improve beijing and help its citizens
1688506 you guys are the ones who are talking all about it im not saying anything
1688507 im just going through doing what i have to do to prepare myself the best that i can to be as fast as i can
1688508 thats my goal and thats what im going to stick with
1688509 i havent said anything about breaking any record going after any record my goals havent been published
1688510 i think michael is a fantastic swimmer and i think if anyone in the world can possibly do it is michael
1688511 i think it will be a great story over the nine days of competition there will be a lot of people watching hoping to see history
1688512 ive been working over the last few weeks to fine tune a few things and hopefully improve the 400 im
1688513 physically hes much stronger and more mature so hes got a lot more power and still has the fitness
1688514 emotionally hes much the same guy handles challenges very well
1688515 the biggest advantage he has now is hes been through the process before so he knew what to expect and hes handled all of the other things that come with the better
1688516 its fun for us to be here not everyone gets the opportunity were lucky to have the opportunity to come over here and swim for our country
1688517 in the village we have like six guys in our apartment its fun
1688518 love never dies a natural death it dies because we dont know how to replenish its source it dies of blindness and errors and betrayals it dies of illness and wounds it dies of weariness of witherings of tarnishings
1688519 this is the world we now live in and we are responsible for creating this world
1688520 hey i heard cochabamba on the news on the radio last week
1688521 terminal 5 is going through a large series of trials
1688522 every system is being tested essentially this is to bring all systems up and working by oct 1
1688523 what is the dis coloration on the board where the leash photo was taken
1688524 were managing the firm to not have to access the government support
1688525 they can come out just as easy as they went in
1688526 la paz bolivia ap a senior u s diplomat tried to improve rocky relations with bolivias leftist government on wednesday and local officials say he offered to cooperate in attempts to extradite a former president and defense minister
1688527 conspiracy theories not one of them is validated by proof on the other side a few weeks ago a group of bolivian army officers closely linked to evo morales were captured minutes after they attempted to commit a terrorist attack against a tv station in yacuiba the vehicles they used in their operation had been rented by the venezuelan embassy in la paz as it has been proven beyond any doubt by the ongoing investigations
1688528 yall are so black and white as if it is bolivia vs the usa
1688529 remember that in the end bolivians will always say f u to the usa no matter if its podemos or mas
1688530 lets all remember that the players here are children the coaches are volunteers please refrain from yelling
1688531 jesus christ kick their asses giants you are losing to a girl
1688532 this was a test of the emergency politically correct broadcast system it is only a test in the event of a genuine breach of the marin politically correct security system you will be told which npr station to turn to for information
1688533 we have the possibility of preventing crashes from happening altogether
1688534 at least 50 children are injured weekly and at least two children die every week from injuries sustained when a vehicle backed over them
1688535 we had a great chemistry in the first film and really good friendship
1688536 as much as we could we stayed in touch in the three years between the two movies im particularly close with amber because on the campaign trail together for hilary clinton we all like to keep in touch because we like each others company
1688537 at the core carmen is dealing with the same issues she was dealing with in the first movie which is her issues with abandonment
1688538 in the first movie her father is moving on without her and this time around its her friends are moving on in an easier way than she is and her mother is remarried and pregnant
1688539 so again her world is moving on without her when shes quite happy with the way things are
1688540 shes upset about being abandoned by her friends and her mother and shes stuck in her shell until she realizes that its time to move on before she becomes an unhappy person
1688541 i was really interested in this notion of how friendships evolve in the first movie the friendships were really sweet and a lot of the conflict came from each of the girls individual lives and stories there wasnt a lot of conflict within the friendship
1688542 what i was excited about this time around was the focus of the friendship and how it was changing with my character and ambers character tibby theyre both so lost in their own struggles that they cant be there for each other i liked that the friendship was getting more complicated
1688543 i think in terms of would i have needed to see this when i was a kid the idea is a little bit selfish to be frank
1688544 but when salma hayek came to me with the idea ugly betty i thought to myself god this is the kind of show i would want to watch if i was a girl sitting at home or even now when it comes to sisterhood and when i read those books and was such a huge fan theses are stories i want to watch as movies
1688545 i pick things that way because im a young woman looking for inspiration
1688546 i think that resounds with other women who feel similarly
1688547 2007 was a year of contrasts for the bolivian economy on the positive side there were record levels of exports and net international reserves combined with a reduction of 57 in the external debt furthermore for the third year running there was a budget surplus and continued growth 4 2 in 2007 as a result of this situation the local currency revalued against the us dollar for the second year running in 2007 by 4 48
1688548 i suggest he wear the mizuno vs 1 volleyball kneepads they are well padded and resist wear and tear the most
1688549 ive got a few bridges to repair but i was only doing my job
1688550 when we started as guerillas we walked from sudan to ethiopia carrying food and ammunition on our heads
1688551 now with the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement the spla has been transformed into a conventional army there is a tremendous change
1688552 during the war we were thinking of fighting now we are thinking of human resource development
1688553 this is what we have been dreaming of it was difficult it was hard but we are on that track
1688554 there are repeated reports of a lack of discipline by certain members of the spla
1688555 this is well known within the spla and senior leadership as well and something they would like to bring better under control
1688556 they need to move away from a situation where some people fear either the police or the army
1688557 in the west they say rome was not built in one day
1688558 for 21 years the spla has been a guerilla army you cant expect it to change in six years since the interim peace agreement
1688559 that alone to be achieved within three years is really incredible
1688560 we want to win the election of 2009 as sudanese and capture power in khartoum through elections
1688561 n o fizemos um bom trabalho na classifica o o que afetou a nossa prova tivemos dificuldades para encontrar desempenho e foi duro disputar com as toyotas e renaults vamos esquecer esse resultado e voltas nossas aten es para val ncia
1688562 infelizmente peguei tr fego antes da minha ltima parada que permitiu o nick heidfeld me ultrapassar o carro estava com problemas com os pneus agora focar na pr xima etapa e ver o que podemos fazer
1688563 foi uma corrida decepcionante foi uma pena mas n o fomos r pidos o bastante
1688564 my reason the less i use the book the more they learn without a textbook i can create curriculum that engages students by relating science to their everyday lives lessons become clearer when i link the topic to an issue that affects them personally
1688565 i dont believe in that holiday i am a insert other belief system here newest keno games online highest amount bet or folded two weeks later we were building an advanced six camera control system slowly getting out of debt and rebuilding relationships in his life
1688566 did demons da vinci code and digital fortress just to see what

1688568 when they retreated it allowed the fire to consume a bigger area
1688569 mas vamos estudar os dados para ver se eles t m algo que permita um reabastecimento mais r pido
1688570 se nos basearmos na nossa performance em budapeste certamente voc dir que n o mas ainda temos o que melhorar no f1 08 vamos ter novidades mec nicas e aerodin micas no carro e o desenolvimento n o vai parar n o estamos satisfeitos com os ltimos resultados
1688571 foi algo completamente inesperado e tenho que admitir que ainda n o sei as raz es para explicar isso mas estamos verificando todo o carro para saber robert deveria brigar pela vit ria mas em algumas fases da prova ele tinha o carro mais lento da pista
1688572 our goal is to offer the best customer service and the widest range of pop culture items on ebay at down to earth prices
1688573 i use this at least 3 times a day in my home gym
1688574 i am distraught it was only yesterday that i found out that it was all over so it hasnt really sunk in yet
1688575 although im bitterly disappointed i think ill look back on my career and feel incredibly fortunate
1688576 i want to express my thanks to gloucester for all the care and support the club has given me and for the help they have pledged to keep giving me
1688577 i won 12 trophies at leicester there was a five year period when we won everything there was to win we were the manchester united of rugby and i count myself very lucky to have been a part of that
1688578 there are very few players who have achieved what leon has during his career and we are as disappointed and upset as he is that his career has ended in this fashion

1688595 in the case of bolivia velde 2003 finds that foreign direct investment may have accounted for a significant part of the observed increase in urban wage inequality during the period 1987 97 with foreign direct investment correlated with lower real wages for skilled and unskilled workers
1688596 regression results show that neither education nor financial market development interact significantly with fdi in their effect on growth
1688597 what is even more remarkable is if you put in context that the neoliberals did this while 1 there were global crisis in dev countries real thai russia and 2 they shifted an economy from being mostly drug state based to a market economy
1688598 now living comfortably in the us you might not be aware of the extreme poverty in bolivia should it surprise you that people are willing to be used for b 50 when you buy a girl in el alto for b 15 you should know that miners for one are willing to die for much much less

1688612 but the interesting thing about velde and this line of study is that fdi foreign investment has worked in most countries done little to help in a few and failed in bolivia the reasons seems to be the inflexible nature of bolivias job market

1688623 we have noticed with concern that for the past one year rvrs presence in uganda has not been felt in terms of established administration rvr seems to have concentrated on establishing themselves more in kenya than in uganda
1688624 i would like to remind rvr that this is a joint concession maintain constant contact and response with the government in connection to matters relating to the concession at the moment there seems to be a breakdown in communication

1688629 it would appear the woman had spoken to the men about smoking earlier this week this morning when she was at the station she was walking past the same men when one them pushed her and she fell onto the track
1688630 she suffered a fractured wrist and bruising to her legs she was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released
1688631 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured the third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train
1688632 i got here at around 8am and there were three police cars
1688633 i heard from other people that a pregnant woman had been pushed on to the track after she asked the men to stop smoking
1688634 there are many better ways of spending public money than arguing in the courts which of two or more publicly funded bodies should pay for care costs where each party agrees that one or other of them must be responsible
1688635 the philosophy that incurring cost does not matter provided it comes out of someone elses budget is to be discouraged
1688636 it is not satisfactory when two publicly funded authorities engage in expensive litigation to decide which of them should pay for the care in her home of a woman whose mental and psychological conditions require constant and expensive care
1688637 in the end the money for the care and the money for the litigation is all coming out of the same purse
1688638 are primarily for health care or for care which a social services authority should undertake
1688639 now maintain that the care is not such that their social services department should be required to undertake it
1688640 both parties agree that one or other of them has to be responsible there can be no gap
1688641 has for a long time now been proceeding very slowly it has to be said towards a further assessment of pes care needs
1688642 i understand that this is in the context of a fresh multi disciplinary team recommendation to the effect that pes care needs are indeed primarily health care needs
1688643 which would not in the first instance require proceedings in court
1688644 upon the assumption that the pcts decision under challenge is upheld this would mean that manchester city council is responsible for her future care unless of course the secretary of states decision were to be successfully challenged

1688650 the last major remnant of saddam hussein s nuclear program
1688651 it seems the presence of the yellow cake which was not concentrated enough to make a bomb but could be used to make a dirty bomb was known to the us government and us army and even the un but its presence was not publicized for fear that it would be looted bush will be vindicated after all

1688655 u n inspectors had documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 persian gulf war there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 the senior u s official said
1688656 u n inspectors had documented and safeguarded the yellowcake which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 persian gulf war
1688657 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
1688658 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
1688659 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
1688660 w e urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
1688661 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
1688662 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
1688663 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs reports indicate that biological chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre gulf war status in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
1688664 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and th e means of delivering them
1688665 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
1688666 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
1688667 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
1688668 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
1688669 i will be voting to give the president of the united states the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam hussein because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security
1688670 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years we also should remember we have always underestimated the progress saddam has made in development of weapons of mass destruction
1688671 he has systematically violated over the course of the past 11 years every significant un resolution that has demanded that he disarm and destroy his chemical and biological weapons and any nuclear capacity this he has refused to do
1688672 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
1688673 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
1688674 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real
1688675 well my guess is because saddam still ran the country and still dictated where the inspectors could go and what they could do
1688676 he had that yellowcake for a reason and it was not peaceful
1688677 550 tons of yellowcake are not some feat of magic that just appears
1688678 yellow cake alone is not considered potent enough for a dirty bomb
1688679 also can be enriched for use in reactors and at higher levels weapons
1688680 interesting how so many of those who support cuchi cuchi worshiper and his band of monolito lovers also supported a mass murderer like saddam hussein is it me or is there some sort of correlation there
1688681 those of us you argue against were completely against sadaam we were also against the bombing to death of innocent iraqi civilians we were also against destabilizing a country and leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people
1688682 in vics comments above he seeks to vindicate bush by creating a false dilemma for those of us whose love of the usa is such that we cannot remain silent when our leaders engage in evil
1688683 there is no principle requiring one to intervene in the affairs of other nations about whose internal affairs we might not be informed we leave it to our elected representatives to deal diplomatically and lawfully with the leaders of other governments
1688684 i hear youre in town today would you like to meet with the congressman
1688685 or conform your lawful political opinions to legal methods of expression
1688686 my prayers go out to them and their wives and children as well as to the bolivian pilot
1688687 people make a judgment about you in the first five seconds after they meet you
1688688 and they are making a judgment about who you are
1688689 where do you want to be three years from now where do you want to be professionally where do you want to be socially
1688690 the first thing you need to do is find out what the fashion culture is where you are going
1688691 in italy you could probably interview in a paprika suit if thats a color that works for you i wouldnt recommend that in japan theyre not fashion forward in the business world
1688692 you need to consider whether you can wear open toed shoes sleeveless shirts or shorts to work thats your responsibility as a person going from one country to another
1688693 we had to consider that she was a female doing business in the middle east
1688694 coming to work in a short skirt would not be looked upon well
1688695 alterations and tailoring have a lot to do with how an article looks on you
1688696 its better to buy a size too big than a size too small the worst that could happen is people will think you lost weight
1688697 as americans i think we need to respect the people and places we visit you need to remember that you are a guest its not just the fashion part of it but the intellectual part as well you can have the right outfit on but if you dont have the right attitude it isnt going to work
1688698 americans think white socks are acceptable that is a big mistake youll see educated powerful people wearing white socks they should know better
1688699 one major faux pas is to be caught in a time warp wearing clothes that are totally outdated for women this would mean frosted blue eye shadow or bright red lipstick
1688700 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were able to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all
1688701 it is a complete work of fiction there is no leadership challenge
1688702 david has done what he set out to do to show very clearly that he is prepared to take on the leadership
1688703 it is not for him to bring down a prime minister and he does not know what will happen to gordon next that is for others to decide
1688704 but he wanted to make it very clear that he is up for this if it comes to a contest putting alan milburn forward as a proposed chancellor would show everyone how serious about rescuing the labour party david is
1688705 im not sure its a very good thought and im not sure it will do david miliband a lot of good
1688706 this has been described as the most valuable domestic burglary ever committed in this country the collection is described as priceless
1688707 there is a difficulty in putting a value on antiques and antiquities some of them very precious and very rare but it is tens of millions of pounds
1688708 cases of this gravity must attract heavy sentences because of the deliberate criminality organisation and sophistication of their planning and the effect on the occupants
1688709 this must be one of the most serious examples of conspiracy to burgle ever to come before the court considering the amounts involved
1688710 little of the property has been recovered and is no doubt well hidden in the countryside or passed on for disposal
1688711 you have no respect for peoples property or the law so i have no alternative but to impose severe sentences
1688712 this report confirms that we have a good grip of the issues facing our rural areas
1688713 mr taylors vision of a living working sustainable countryside and the desire to create a lasting legacy of places in which people want to live certainly reflects the way the assembly has approached planning for the next 20 years and beyond in the south west
1688714 our mychoicehomebuy product is already proving to be very popular and its great to see it benefiting such a hard working couple as elisa and marco
1688715 the equity loans we offer act similarly to a large cash deposit making the purchase of a home much more affordable to customers and giving excellent protection to lenders mortgages
1688716 we were so pushed for space we even had to resort to putting our wedding presents in a shed initially the couple were concerned about the costs of buying a home outright on the open market and were considering their options when a friend told elisa about mychoicehomebuy
1688717 my friend explained how we could apply for the scheme through the mho housing options service even though we werent key workers i found further information online but it was good to have someone i could trust telling me about how it all works said elisa
1688718 viewing the apartment was very exciting it was perfect everything from the flooring to the heating the kitchen and the garden was newly done after two hours we decided to make an offer although our monthly outgoings have increased we know the 1 200 monthly cost is manageable and is a sound investment for our future
1688719 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1688720 i am very proud of the staff members who have put in the time and effort into this study
1688721 i know officers that have completed the nvq are really impressed with the new skills they have learnt and some are looking to further their knowledge and undertake additional courses
1688722 the largest number of staff worked towards gaining their nvq in customer service
1688723 this has been an important initiative for south essex homes in that south essex homes is a very people focussed business as such it was felt to be important that the staff who have contact with their customers understand how their behaviour can impact on the service and experience of all the residents
1688724 it is totally overwhelming for her she told me she dearly hopes that her information helps but i do not think it is fair that portuguese police have revealed her details
1688725 she doesnt want to talk to anyone at the moment she has come here to do her days work but more than 30 journalists have come in to try to talk with her
1688726 there are about 20 outside right now she is suddenly hollands most in demand person i do not think it helps
1688727 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1688728 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1688729 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1688730 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1688731 pinnacles experience of managing social housing has given us tremendous awareness of the high levels of worklessness amongst social housing tenants and the concentrations of economic inactivity in particular communities
1688732 our approach has always been to put residents the customer at the heart of service delivery by providing solutions which promote sustainable communities and improve the quality of life for residents
1688733 pinnacle people is a natural step towards integrating housing and employment services which will benefit communities where we work
1688734 our services offer innovative solutions for success delivered within neighbourhoods and in partnership with residents
1688735 we offer people the route to self sufficiency and independence creating choice in place of dependency we also have an uncompromising commitment to place our services are designed to leave a lasting legacy
1688736 the decline in many traditional local industries which were once thought of as established such as knitwear and hosiery has had a knock on effect on the business communities of many of north leicesters outer city estates
1688737 were confident the new greenacres centre will bring back some of the much needed local business activity creating a thriving centre and strengthening the community spirit were grateful for natwests help and look forward to a long and mutually rewarding relationship
1688738 weve been very impressed with chaos business plan and future aspirations for the greenacres centre
1688739 they had a clear vision for the project and we were able to tailor a funding package accordingly we look forward to supporting them and wish them much success in their endeavour

1688742 sometimes when the past is lingering and staring at you in a drawer it can be upsetting
1688743 these figures reveal a basic lesson that could be key to the survival of many developers in the current market location
1688744 investland went through a similar experience when we first entered the residential market in the early 1990s putting a great deal of effort into identifying areas that we felt would become popular for home buyers a few years down the road
1688745 our experience has shown that building high specification projects in locations that we believe in will deliver results in any market of course this is easier said than done
1688746 identifying locations that will grow in desirability is far from being a simple task but if done right it can be the best way for developers to extract value from a challenging market
1688747 good locations can also be fashioned so if a developer shows enough commitment to an area and works hard at being a regenerative influence it is possible to create the kind of location that the study suggests home buyers are looking for
1688748 that level of development can mean taking a risk but this survey has shown that its a risk worth taking it is not enough to simply generate an adequate end product developers still need to understand the implications of geography and infrastructure and exactly what represents a good location to the consumer
1688749 look this race stuff is a bad tired joke and is the ugly politics of yesterday the simple fact is that if barrack hussein obama was for lower taxes less government a strong national defense more domestic oil supply and finishing the job in iraq i might not be here now hed likely be the gop nominee for president so enough with this childish nonsense if democrats have a problem with race as showed up in their primary if racism is alive and well in their party thats their problem and im not going to stand by and have that sort of nastiness foisted on the country as a whole by the media or anyone else republicans are about issues first last and always and would be more than happy to have barrack as our nominee if he had better politics and policies regardless of his skin color
1688750 dont pick a fight with an old man if he cant fight you hell just kill you
1688751 though i personally believe civil disobedience was appropriate in that october but lets not debate that here
1688752 sorry but that is the crux of the case the mas has already killed several civilians under the same operating logic that goni did so it looks like they want it to have it both ways
1688753 now if you want to ignore this then feel free but the main argument for their asylum still stands they cannot possible get a fair trial
1688754 now i guess that you were not in la paz during those days because 1 that was not civil disobedience it was closer to armed rebellion and 2 their grievance no gas for chile did not justify their use or violence or laying siege to the city

1688775 big oil is more interested in pumping up prices and pumping up their own profits rather than pumping more oil

1688784 if i am elected president we will work to prevent venezuela and bolivia from taking the same road to failure castro has paved for cuba and we will broaden and strengthen ties with key states like brazil peru and chile
1688785 colombia is a beacon of hope in a region where the castro brothers venezuelan president hugo ch vez and others are actively seeking to thwart economic progress and democracy
1688786 it is disingenuous of mccain to suggest venezuela is not democratic
1688787 i guess they never shot down that one tv station youre right they didnt they revoked the public license at that tv station can still be caught on cable

1688805 gt greece post left fielder matt bellucco makes a diving attempt at a ball hit into foul territory during saturdays american legion district 7 championship played at newarks colburn park
1688806 it was an amazing accomplishment for this team and i am very proud of the way they played and handled themselves throughout the season
1688807 the aluminum bats were definitely an advantage for us from using wood all year
1688808 every player became a better hitter from using wood for the first 30 games of the year we now take swings at better pitches and that is going to help us in the state tournament
1688809 as long as the bats stay hot and the pitching and defense play the way they did all year the sky is the limit for us this week
1688810 every team has a comparable record as us but monroe county is one of if not the most competitive league in the state and that prepared us immensely to get to this point
1688811 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote he also says no to nuclear storage and no to reprocessing i could not disagree more
1688812 so if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in 10 years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1688813 we can do limited off shore drilling with strict environmental oversight while giving tax incentives to get detroit to make hybrid and electric cars
1688814 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1688815 im a huge comic book fan and ive wanted to do some comic book work for a while now and what better way to get my start than with a wrestling comic so when headlocked writer creator mike kingston asked me if i would be interested in doing a cover i jumped at the chance
1688816 the mans been on television in movies and hes a household name to three generations of wrestling fans so were obviously very pleased to be publishing jerry lawlers first comic book work
1688817 ive always been a huge lawler fan i used to trade for tapes of memphis wrestling back before you could find everything on the internet getting to work with him and actually getting to watch him physically paint the cover has easily been my career highlight thus far
1688818 its a story about all the crazy stuff that goes into what you see on television when a guy shows up on a wwe show he most likely already has four to seven years in the wrestling business but you rarely hear anything about that headlocked is the chronicle of that journey for mike hartmann
1688819 he approaches wrestling the same way he did acting he bulks up just like an actor preparing for an action movie and he moves to philadelphia which is essentially hollywood for aspiring wrestlers because of his background were able to put a little more focus on the craft of professional wrestling and examine its place as a true performance art
1688820 there are a lot of coming of age themes in headlocked the story is just as much about hartmann becoming a man as it is about him becoming a wrestler hes a nineteen year old college kid who has given up his relatively safe existence to chase this crazy dream and at the same time hes almost totally reinventing who he is from the ground up hes pretty much out there on his own in a new city trying to forge this new identity for himself while navigating through the darker underbelly of the wrestling business as a total outsider
1688821 hartmann has just moved to philadelphia having secured a tryout with the legendary leo
1688822 i knew right away when the decision was made that we would be real strong this season
1688823 there were a lot of guys who also wanted more than what we had in 2007 and i knew that they knew what it took
1688824 we had a few guys grumble about playing time but it was nothing out of the ordinary
1688825 this team played together all season with a common goal and they achieved it as a unit
1688826 this team is very good our pitching is lined up and a lot of the other teams in the tournament have similar records to us
1688827 we are going to play like we have played all year and see if we can pull it off
1688828 she has been so great with the team coming to all of the games and trips
1688829 they are all like little brothers to us and i wanted to make them a part of it
1688830 she asked me suspiciously why he was there before the game and i just made up an excuse like he had a day off and wanted to watch us play
1688831 it was really a special moment and a great day
1688832 i was literally in my car and thought paris must respond its her duty as a citizen
1688833 within three hours i was on the phone with her and she was into it
1688834 mccain made one huge mistake he drifted into the world of pop culture and thats paris world she owns that world
1688835 our next goal is a town hall style debate between paris mccain and that sea creature that washed up in montauk

1688846 my original concept was to have the entire restaurant cast in the shape of a hotdog and bun
1688847 but the contractors told me that it would cost too much
1688848 originally maurie and flourie were made out of papier m ch but that only lasted two years
1688849 then we made new ones out of silastic plastic strips but like the paper it did not do well in chicagos harsh weather the third version made of hard plastic fared a little better but the fiberglass seems to have worked the best
1688850 apparently the owner collected indian paraphernalia and saw this giant figure of geronimo on a reservation in arizona
1688851 in about 1966 he had to bring the statue back on a flatbed truck but that was only the beginning of the huge problems he faced in putting it up because it was near midway airport the owner had to get a variance and the wind and weather in chicago made it necessary for him to reinforce the buildings roof and put in all kinds of cables and wires
1688852 if you were in the local library and looked out the window at a certain angle toward his crotch geronimos thumb stuck up and out like a giant flesh colored penis
1688853 it caused such a stir that playboy came out and took a photograph of it
1688854 i think that in the old days a giant fiberglass figure was a way to make your business a landmark
1688855 you could tell customers drive down the highway till you see the big indian now we have cell phones to call for directions or gps to tell you exactly where to go but most of all these figures were silly and a lot of fun which is something that i think we are losing as a society

1688879 watkins glen has always been a so so track for me weve had decent runs but dont really have the solid finishes to show for it we had a good test at road atlanta a few weeks ago to prepare for this weekend were taking the same car we took to sonoma and i think the car was pretty good out there we just had some bad luck that day
1688880 it was really important the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our racecar each and every race its a tough battle right now for us to come out of pocono and gain two positions in the chase is a credit to kenny francis and all the guys that work on this budweiser dodge theres still a lot of racing left but pocono was a good weekend for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team
1688881 momentum is good its confidence its good for a driver good for the team and good for the people back in the shop you could lose 50 straight races and win one and its like you forget about all that stuff its a relief and it feels so good because of how hard it is to win these races for a driver and the whole team company i think winning races and running up front is as much of a confidence builder that you can have in racing
1688882 i am more scared when he takes me on a drive
1688883 im not scared when hes on the track as hes really good obviously having won monaco and the british grand prix
1688884 im more terrified when he takes me on a drive especially through the canyons in la wow but hes great and i trust him
1688885 i can handle los angeles driving stop and go im good at that
1688886 we just see each other as normal people were very private and we keep to ourselves work is different and we both lead public lives but were just two normal people who are passionate about what we do
1688887 with its black and white recreations the movie often has the urgency of a heist thriller and comes to resemble a dissection of the conspiracy of a clandestine cell of terrorists yet the ultimate act buoyed by an insistent score drawn from michael nymans back catalog grows immensely illogically beautifully thrilling
1688888 you remember that wonderful scene in robert altmans film the chandler adaptation the long goodbye
1688889 there is some moviemaking in that if fact since youve seen the movie a couple of times youre probably glimpsing a blueprint of the world trade center early on in that opening sequence which as you say sets up a kind of somethings going on people are getting together theyre up to no good theyve got a plot against something obviously there are sort of morbid dimensions to it and we were deliberately playful about it but of course i was aware of some of the obvious underlying connections with later events the idea was not to show your hand too much or to be too crude about it but of course a bunch of foreigners hanging around a new york monument photographing it examining it for its possibilities for a spectacle its all implicit in the story one doesnt have to try too hard if you tell the story thats just going to come off of it i think it would have been a mistake to go any further with it
1688890 yeahhh i think everyone will have a slightly different response on that level to a lesser or greater degree yknow quite frankly what is it that one would show you at the end how would we do it the last thing you want to do is to confuse these two events even as you rightly point out there are interesting kinds of implicit parallels and some of the imagery even of people looking up one is the inversion of the other during philippes walk you see people looking up with joy and awe and wonder and you see the kind of imagery with very different and much more disturbing expressions around 9 11 and the terrible disaster there it was a very easy choice to make going a defining choice going into the project there was a little pressure from producers who say should we get philippe to give us his views and im saying very clearly no i dont think im ever going to do that the last thing you want is repeat imagery that for me is already been repeated and cheapened and diminished and exploited as well the other thing about what happened on 9 11 has been exploited by politicians in a particular kind of way the whole thing is so ugly and foul and vile and we lost innocence in new york city theres something about new york in the seventies that was far from innocent but this bold act was possible at that time we have lost something you cant barrel through jfk anymore with a bow and arrow in your suitcase
1688891 isnt that what old people get when they go outside in winter without a coat

1688908 and fiu would still rank over any university on the south american continent
1688909 the article above claims outright that morales had a hand in organising the march against the embassy however it provides no evidence even circumstantial to back this up he then bases the rest of the article on that assumption
1688910 the folks standing around the shirtless campesinos are also of indigenous descent in fact i couldnt find a single euro face

1688916 how many lives and confrontations would have been avoided if in that moment we had approved the law
1688917 well now that wouldn t be legal last night a taxi driver and i came up with this metaphor what if after we agreed that id pay 15 bolivianos to go from cochabamba to tiquipaya i announced on arrival that 5 bs seemed a fairer price and paid that neither does the bolivian constitution allow for such sudden one sided changes

1689232 its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas
1689233 its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1689240 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1689241 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1689242 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1689243 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1689244 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1689245 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1689246 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
1689247 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
1689248 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us

1689259 i know what its like to build up your hopes and have them thwarted and wouldnt wish that on anyone else
1689260 when i was younger my dream was always to compete at the olympics but i had so many injuries that id given up hope
1689261 if youd told me a year or 18 months ago that id be a reserve for beijing i wouldnt have believed you

1689283 the priorities for my parents werent sports they were to put bread on the table to move ahead and become good american citizens
1689284 outreach programs would make things easier for people less fortunate help the kids who have potential to maybe find the road to the next level
1689285 right now there is no road its bushwhacking your way through to the other side and most of them get lost
1689286 the parents dont know their way through the system a lot of the kids cant get scholarships as easily as african americans can
1689287 i need to find out more i dont have all the answers
1689288 we have to do more to take the fine young athletes that exist among new americans and find some ways of creating opportunities for them they are underrepresented
1689289 i did have some classmates that were discouraged by parents to play sports and many were very talented
1689290 they would start the season on a sports team and halfway through quit because they couldnt make practice they had to baby sit or run errands for their moms
1689291 in commerce more parents now see that their children can represent the u s at the olympics
1689292 the city does a good job of giving their olympians a lot of recognition so residents are forced to become familiar with the olympians and that accessibility gives them hope and encouragement
1689293 the spanish networks need to do their part in exposing hispanic athletes in the nontraditional sports so that parents can see all the options their kids have

1689306 bob schaffer rejected what his son had on that website

1689310 at some point if the legislature doesnt do something then the local governments in the front range in the metro denver region will have to take action ourselves
1689311 the main point was to stress to the legislature how important adequate transportation funding is to the state and to the economy of the state
1689312 it is true that there was not substantive transportation funding out of the 08 legislative session but what did come out was an increased recognition of the urgency and importance of the issue and that is productive
1689313 we prefer to address transportation funding needs and mechanisms on a statewide basis
1689314 i believe after this election well see more cooperation on both sides of the aisle

1689316 it clearly lays out the case that cindy mccain is not only the dealer of a drug
1689317 but the dealer of a drug far more harmful than marijuana

1689324 i just found out that they did charge casey formally today which is a good thing because look what they charged her with to me that is actually almost a victory for the home team today because they obviously have not found anything
1689325 every moment that passes i die a little bit inside every day not having her
1689326 she is a part of me and without her i feel incomplete
1689327 we bring caylee and everybody is going to know and casey is not going to be this monster that everybody has painted her out to be
1689328 as much as i wanted to see casey today and visit with her i couldnt
1689329 i did get to meet with her attorney and he is going to be able to speak with her in private with my thoughts and the things that i want to talk to her about
1689330 i had all of these mixed feeling about should i go or shouldnt i go
1689331 bottom line was that i made the decision this morning that i wasnt going to go
1689332 it was a meeting at our request just to touch base with them and see where we are all at
1689333 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1689334 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1689335 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1689336 todays indictments are a reminder of a growing threat that every american faces in the 21st century the fact that each individuals greatest asset is their names their identity
1689337 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1689338 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1689339 to me its inexplicable they could come up with this ruling hes admitted it
1689340 just because you say im sorry should not satisfy the legal requirements to pay a fine to the state when you violate a law

1689384 the way the gaa works you might have a three year term but i have never stayed in any job when i wasnt wanted and that would be the situation now im willing to live by my commitment but obviously ill have to sit down with the county board and see what they want i have to sit down with tommy lyons and kieran gallagher i would probably want to continue but well see how the dust settles itll be down to other people it wont be totally my decision it never is thats the way it goes
1689385 if anybody would look back on what i said when i took this job people are going to have to hold the nerve
1689386 ive a fair idea i know what needs to be done
1689387 mayo will always be a force in football possibly even in the short term i think the experience that was gained by some of those lads this year will be huge going into the coming season
1689388 you have tom keith higgins trevor howley aidan kilcoyne aidan campbell tom parsons a lot of young players a number of other ones would come into the mix what i would have seen is the development of that 2006 u 21 team along with the peadars gardiner and the james nallens
1689389 james nallen was a wonderful example this year he took the winter off and didnt play any league football but kept himself in shape came back when we gave him the call and he had a wonderful game out there
1689390 david heaney got some criticism after the connacht final but i think he did exceptionally well also its about getting that blend between the experienced lads and the younger lads
1689391 when you add this to losing to galway by a point its very disappointing
1689392 i felt at half time that we could push on and win the game
1689393 there were a number of harsh calls but i think when you lose a game you just have to face up to it and take it on the chin
1689394 we had to change our tactics somewhat from the galway game
1689395 you pick your team on the resources you have and you tweak it but i would have to give our lads huge credit for the way they ran themselves silly out there
1689396 it was a lonely two weeks for ronan and a lonely three weeks for trevor in the sense of the individual work they had to do away from training the first time they got in to do a bit of football was last thursday night it was a big blow to lose two players of that calibre from your starting line up but thats what you have a squad for i dont want to make excuses but pat harte was struggling from a tummy bug also and did well to last the first half but thats what every team has to take they are hammer blows but you just motor on its as simple as that
1689397 we are in the middle of a seven week programme and working with 70 children boys and girls between the ages of seven and twelve with the assistance of the ballyhaunis refugee centre
1689398 i would say our activities have been very well receieved mayo is a massive area of course involving many people at all levels of football
1689399 the support i have got from the junior leagues and the womens leagues and mayo schoolboys leagues has been outstanding and we are working together as a football partnership for the betterment of all
1689400 we meet on a regular basis and the work of rolling out the many football programmes is only coming to fruition now
1689401 the elite players training programme is up and running and we are working towards having some more good quality coaches in place by september
1689402 been on our radar due to the fact that it is a town thriving with development opportunities
1689403 our research shows that the people of telford appreciate value for money
1689404 we have thousands of quality products at unbelievably low prices and with the current credit crunch i feel that its our duty to bring these products to the people of shropshire
1689405 were delighted to welcome the range into the centre its terrific to be able to welcome a retail success story to the area and to announce the creation of so many jobs

1689408 this game will do us a lot of good mayo are a quality side and it was a big test for us
1689409 there was a period early on in the second half where we seemed to lose our way and we were staring at the brink of going out it certainly wasnt pretty but we managed to turn it around
1689410 it is due to the forecast which is currently saying heavy showers so we feel its better to be safe than sorry
1689411 the gross overloading and sewage problems in castlebar at present
1689412 the council would not agree with that measure proposed by the fisheries board i can understand the position of the fisheries board but it is not fair to penalise the people who want to live in castlebar its not right to hinder the people who have rights and pay taxes they are not to blame this is the responsibility of the minister of the environment john gormley who has not approved the finances to get this thing going they are hitting the wrong people the fisheries board should get behind us in lobbying the minister for the environment for the funds to get the town sewerage plant up and running
1689413 it is unfortunately inevitable that when you are responsible for large buildings like hospitals and their extensive grounds you will face problems with pests
1689414 this is why we have a contract with a pest control company to help us ensure that these issues are managed effectively in our buildings and grounds
1689415 remarkably no birds were injured or killed in the fire and this is credit to the team
1689416 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1689417 no plans at this time to relocate ballina district court office
1689418 while solicitors support the efforts made in the past by the courts service in seeking to improve court facilities and applaud the work done on some courthouses in the county the decision to cease from the 1st january 2009 to hold district courts in ballyhaunis ballinrobe and charlestown particularly smacks of bureaucratic administrative convenience and centralisation which should have no place in the administration of justice in modern ireland
1689419 i just cant afford to do it anymore the prices are going up faster than im selling the petrol and diesel the price is going up four or five cents sometimes more than three times a week the shop will still be going but the petrol pumps just arent sustainable anymore
1689420 i had to make a difficult decision i dont regret it as a business decision but i do regret it for my customers now they dont have any petrol for a six mile radius
1689421 when id get a fill of petrol and diesel it would cost me between 30 000 35 000
1689422 thats about 10 000 more than the same time last year customers have been very understanding and id like to thank them for being so loyal over the years
1689423 overall food prices are rising but retailers are keeping increases well below the extra supply and operating costs they face
1689424 falls in the prices of oil and some world food commodities such as wheat and soya provide hope but most retail costs remain sharply up on a year ago and are still rising
1689425 fifty five per cent of people are now cutting down on their grocery spend as their other bills increase
1689426 so while food inflation increased again in july savings will need to be made by shopping differently to help pay for the other increases in household spend such as energy and fuel
1689427 the marked jump in shop prices in july may exert some late pressure for an interest rate hike on thursday
1689428 however it remains odds on that the bank of england will keep interest rates unchanged as evidence is mounting that the economic downturn is deepening and widening
1689429 indeed we believe that mild recession is now more likely than not
1689430 most of the residents are wondering what is the point of it
1689431 they feel it is a waste of money that could be better spent on other things in the town
1689432 it will enhance the recreational amenity of the river and i hope it will become an iconic symbol of ballina which will attract residents and visitors alike
1689433 everyone in inverclyde will be delighted to hear this this shows people have been listening i am delighted it appears there were some people prepared to hear the many valid arguments put forward
1689434 if the health board had accepted the recommendation of the independent scrutiny panel all those months ago then we would not have had all this uncertainty
1689435 the health board has seen sense once again the inverclyde community demonstrated it can influence decisions and challenge the people who take them
1689436 i am personally delighted and the whole community can take great satisfaction from this including the tele which is often the glue that holds these campaigns together
1689437 this feels like winning the lottery it means people will be able to have their children in a good unit that belongs to inverclyde
1689438 all the folk in inverclyde from the young to the elderly deserve a big thank you
1689439 the four men who were in the car jumped out and started running
1689440 i felt really down i didnt want to do anything anymore i had never felt depressed before but this completely took over i should have been counting my lucky stars to be alive after the car accident but that feeling had wore off
1689441 i had a pressurised job but i found out quickly that i couldnt deal with pressure any more
1689442 i know when people look at me that there shouldnt be anything wrong with me i look fine physically but if people could only see inside any one of us is only a hairs breath away from depression
1689443 without the centre i dont know what would have happened to me and people like me it really is a lifesaver
1689444 they forget that these services are what keeps us going we can go to the centres and relax and forget about our problems for a while we also get to support each other in a fun and relaxed environment which is very important for people with mental illness
1689445 some of them are very nervous and anxious about the future this is bringing worry on them at a time when they really dont need it its tough enough to battle mental illness and then have an organisation that is meant to be caring withdraw services that are vital for vulnerable people
1689446 we have to do something we feel that things will only get worse our message to the hse is to leave us alone and dont take any more from us
1689447 we werent told a thing we started hearing bits and pieces and then services started to disappear weve been treated very badly
1689448 i suddenly realised that i was alone i couldnt deal with how i felt i felt very depressed about the whole thing
1689449 you make firm friends there and people look out for each other i found it really helped me when i needed somewhere to turn to
1689450 there is very little left but if that goes we have nothing at all there have been cutbacks everywhere
1689451 i was on the phone to my sister when she walked past i saw her looking back at me and then coming over i couldnt believe it lorraine is so beautiful and stylish and it was such a wonderful feeling to know that she admired what i had chosen to wear
1689452 although theres always a part of you hoping to be chosen you never really think itll happen i feel like charlie in charlie and the chocolate factory having found the golden ticket

1689468 while lefties moan that the world at large discriminates against them our sinister brethren have all the advantages in sports whenever they directly face right handers
1689469 there was a lot of work our businesses had been doing during the second quarter to adjust to the downturn which resulted in savings and reduced expenses
1689470 it appears all that work may not have been evident to the street
1689471 i think the black athlete has ultimately made a deep if subconscious impression on whites
1689472 the amazing thing about expensive sports attendance is that most often you can stay home and watch the game for free instead
1689473 how can we fans afford to pay these high ticket prices
1689474 come on out and see us live and its ok go ahead tape us making music
1689475 there are opportunities for the sport to adapt and there are signs that it is doing so

1689479 at the derby they let 20 horses run which is far too many so the most important race in america is more determined by luck than skill as the thundering herd blasts out of the starting gates
1689480 some of his friends were in yesterday evening and cannot get their heads around what has happened he was a lovely out going and very popular lad he was sporty and loved socialising and was a great friend to everyone very caring he was never down and always had a smile on his face and saw the funny side to everything
1689481 we are anxious to get the project completed as soon as possible as soon as it can be organised for the different people involved we hope to have most of the work done by winter
1689482 granddad fought a tough battle with cancer and was determined to do everything he could to raise money for the local cancer support group here in erris
1689483 before he died he said that he wanted donations instead of flowers at his funeral and for the money to go to the palliative care team to thank them for the amazing help and support they showed not just to him but to the whole family while donations were received they fell well short of what we know granddad would have hoped for unfortunately he cannot organise another raffle so we have decided to raise some money for this fantastic team in his name
1689484 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1689485 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1689486 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1689487 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the to express theirs
1689488 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1689489 ive been living here four years now and this situation has been a constant feature all that time in september 2005 there was a fatal road accident on this road and there have been five accidents on this stretch in the month of july
1689490 when the road is wet thats when the number of incidents increase were not talking about boy racers here bus drivers taxi men women out shopping have all gone off the road even a garda car has crashed here
1689491 theres going to be another fatal accident here if something isnt done the council is coming out here to replant the trees which are being hit by these cars can they not see that theres a problem
1689492 cars are mounting this footpath leading to the entrance to our town park which is used by so many people especially children i am fearful that pedestrians lives are in serious danger
1689493 with the amount of accidents occurring at this spot at alarming regularity its difficult to fathom why nothing has been done to make this section of road safe when this road is wet its like a skating rink
1689494 this section of road and indeed the n59 from the bishops palace to the entrance of carrabines on the sligo road is now a blackspot and i am asking the engineers and council managers to sit up take notice and do something about it
1689495 shoppers could not give tuppence for the aesthetics of a building
1689496 when they went to sell hopkins field the town council settled for a half a million pounds and they didnt want five retail units
1689497 i wish them well but i wish the planning and aesthetics had been done better
1689498 we run regular workshops and seminars around the country we get a lot of interest from both men and women but only about ten percent of the people at our seminars are women
1689499 we under stand that people can feel uncomfortable in the unfamiliar environment of finance and thats the whole reasoning behind the free workshops anyone can attend no previous knowledge is needed the workshops give a good grounding in investment and then anyone who wants to can do a full day seminar
1689500 the presenter simplified the whole process of investment and i realised i could take control of my own finances with confidence
1689501 garda on mobile patrol are detecting more drivers driving over the legal limit the morning after this year than in previous years in mayo
1689502 due to the influx of tourists the countys population increases significantly during the summer months we hope this awareness raising will act as an effective deterrent through the season said sgt joe mckenna at castlebar garda headquarters
1689503 many people believe the effects of alcohol will have worn off by morning and they will be fit to drive people just dont realise that they may still be over the limit and may get caught and lose their licence and also may suffer the effects of fatigue which result in one in five fatal collisions
1689504 at 30 i became a pub landlord but lost my wife soon after and i turned to food and beer by the time i was 35 i weighed 20 stone and had to give up playing my beloved rugby
1689505 i remember sitting down 26 times when i tried to walk a mile because my hips and knees were aching so much
1689506 because of my size i withdrew from family life and from society but didnt admit it to myself
1689507 i couldnt get weighed on domestic scales and it was a shock to discover i weighed 28st 12lb when i first stepped onto the
1689508 i spend a lot of time travelling and it has never been a problem i plan ahead i enjoy a breakfast of cereal and yoghurt buy sandwiches or a salad from the super market at lunch time and snack on fruit in the afternoon
1689509 i eat lots of fish and love lamb shanks or turkey steaks with lots of vegetables or large stir fry packs and i can still enjoy eating out at indian restaurants or takeaways
1689510 the doom and gloom forecast in the tourism and accommodation sectors will be surly to boosted by the influx of thousands of music fans from right around the country for the week long festival this year
1689511 it has been a tough summer for everyone the tourists are just not around and everyone is feeling the pinch hotels b amp bs restaurants and pubs are suffering this summer so we hope that the music festival will lift the spirits a bit before the season is completely over
1689512 we have really struggled to raise the money to keep the fabulous entertainment free this year were really calling on everyone to come out and support the bands which include sharon shannon mundy robert mizzell white water the walls and rag s
1689513 if were to keep the gigs free we need support i just hope that people come out and enjoy the music and give as generously as they can to the donation buckets
1689514 i have a business here a filling station which is open 24 hours per day seven days per week every week of the year
1689515 from here in erris to castle bar is a 100 mile round trip and last year i would have done that trip five days a week and if not then i was travelling outside the county one day alone i left here at
1689516 if the person who covered here was entitled to the minimum wage then i should also have been entitled to it the expenses themselves were not exorbitantly high compared to the work i did i travelled abroad to speak on numerous occasions and made many links with people who have made a huge contribution to the area i certain ly dont have to apologise for that and think i did a great job
1689517 if you look at them in detail they do not take in the sub committees and corporations outside of the council that councillors are on i do acknowledge that i am well paid but you will find i am not the third highest councillor if the figures are done properly
1689518 i dont dispute we are well paid but this is not a job for everyone we are always on call
1689519 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1689520 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1689521 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1689522 the commercial ad is exceptional and hits the mark for secret obsession we are anticipating a very successful global launch
1689523 teasing her viewers with her innocent but naughty schoolgirl appeal
1689524 this blue eyed cutie dreams of hosting a tabloid tv show such as

1689526 there were 60 crewmen eating salami sandwiches it really was the least sexy thing you can ever imagine
1689527 she and i have been asked that question a thousand times and we are sorry that we dont have any funny stories to tell you about it
1689528 we just end up seeing it on a billboard somewhere
1689529 but i think that its smart and its fine and its cool
1689530 everybody keeps saying theyre so racy of course theyre racy but you say theyre smart
1689531 the service is designed like a simple search engine utility which does not requires any registration process users can classify their search based on the boarding location and also select the type of bus which includes a c non a c seating or sleeper class
1689532 let me start out by saying that this isnt going to go over very well at all but that never stopped me before i have decided that it is indeed time to sue the us congress over the high price of energy and the bill they tried to pass earlier this year has opened them up to the suit
1689533 a rant about our federal debt and the bush administrations role in it
1689534 just a couple questions id really like answers to especially during this election cycle
1689535 between the categorical rule and the blanket exemption for background principles of state property law the supreme court has begotten a brave new form of eminent domain that enables the states to completely bypass the just compensation protection set forth by our founding fathers in the fifth amendment
1689536 that is he argues that private property should be subject to government planning restrictions if a developer building densely on its property creates a traffic burden on government roads
1689537 a us department of health and human services hhs draft document was just leaked that proposes to redefine nearly all forms of contraceptives especially birth control pills as a form of abortion and allows any federal grant recipient to obstruct a womans access to contraception including birth control pills pdf
1689538 what do salmon passenger pigeons american bison and wildebeest have in common they all are or were migratory and their populations either are declining or have become extinct in fact the populations of nearly all migratory animals from insects to fishes birds to mammals are suffering disproportionate population declines that sedentary species are not experiencing
1689539 we recently published an article titled removing the fossil fuel blinders which details the main problems regarding our current energy situation the damaged economy climate change and global national security we discuss factors that contribute to the current situation including government subsidies politicians overlooking truly clean alternative energy in favor of offshore drilling schemes and potential solutions and approaches we may take to abate the problems
1689540 neuropathy is a chronic and significant problem in hiv patients as there are few existing treatments that offer adequate pain management to sufferers
1689541 we found that smoked cannabis was generally well tolerated and effective when added to the patients existing pain medication resulting in increased pain relief
1689542 this study adds to a growing body of evidence that indicates that cannabis is effective in the short term at least in the management of neuropathic pain
1689543 hey lookie here i just pulled energy out of my ass

1689548 he always had this sense that he was going to get through this and that he wanted to give something back
1689549 i dont want to preach or give any advice i never really related a lot to that kind of art i want to let people take whatever they want from it im having fun
1689550 our next steps are to go after these reservoirs of hiv and although much work needs to be done to find and eliminate them infected people who have access to antiretroviral drugs and who take them as prescribed stand a good chance of leading normal lives
1689551 adding more drugs to current regimens will not further reduce the amount of virus in the blood
1689552 we have already reached rock bottom in using drugs to stop hiv from replicating the trace amounts of virus that remain are coming from viral reservoirs not active replication of the virus
1689553 the shoes should help me improve my swing and ill be able to walk the tournaments now
1689554 it got to a point where he couldnt keep up
1689555 it was such a relief to know what it was and what we were dealing with
1689556 this young girls feet were twisted and deformed like the limbs of an old oak tree
1689557 this was the kind of deformity a 90 year old might develop not a healthy adolescent it made quite an impression
1689558 there were definitely feelings of frustration he just couldnt keep up
1689559 dr pfeffer answered our questions the way wed hoped and we had total confidence he could do the surgery
1689560 i can tell her what cmt is all about and help her through it
1689561 there are a large number of americans with cmt who sit at home dont go to high school dances dont play sports dont get jobs all because they dont know what can be done for them
1689562 when you take away the burden of cmt these young people finally begin to fly
1689563 he worked quick he was in command of all of his pitches it was very impressive
1689564 he had end stage heart failure and was at the brink of death when he arrived output from his heart could not be maintained even though he was receiving maximum intravenous medications in the icu
1689565 we had to implant the device in an emergency operation he was then able to go home to wait for a donor heart and kidney to become available
1689566 i was scared and happy and surprised at the same time
1689567 he is a young guy with a great family without the transplants he would not have the quality of life that he now can expect and without the pump he would not have survived at all
1689568 our staff and transplant coordinators make every effort to help resolve financial insurance and funding issues and its very rewarding for us to see that patients receive the medical care they need
1689569 it is remarkable how big a difference having a constructive and supportive legislature even when money is still tight makes in campus morale and attitude there is a startling difference between the two universities uw madison and the university of minnesota right now

1689573 giungono dalle trincee delle guerre dimenticate dagli oscuri territori dove in agguato la morte dai sordidi recessi di unumanit negata e vilipesa ma sono lettere che inneggiano alla vita e trasudano speranza
1689574 violenze sessuali in ituri i civili sono sempre le prime vittime
1689575 i bambini non solo lottano contro laids ma anche contro il tempo
1689576 mentre continuiamo il nostro impegno per attuare strategie pi efficaci di prevenzione contro la trasmissione verticale da madre a figlio fondamentale che a tutti i bambini sia diagnosticata la malattia e che comincino la cura prima possibile o troppi continueranno a morire
1689577 sono cos pochi i bambini che nascono con lhiv nei paesi industrializzati che la ricerca sulle formulazioni pediatriche non una priorit per le aziende farmaceutiche
1689578 la maggior parte delle medicine al momento disponibili mal si adattano ad un utilizzo in contesti di risorse limitate poich si commerciano sotto forma di polveri che hanno bisogno di essere sciolte in acqua o di sciroppi dal gusto amaro che richiedono anche la refrigerazione e per quanto riguarda i farmaci approvati recentemente non abbiamo studi che ne attestino la sicurezza per uso pediatrico
1689579 i medicinali da soli non bastano a mantenere in vita i bambini con lhiv aids
1689580 sia i bambini che coloro che se ne prendono cura hanno bisogno di sostegno psicologico insieme al trattamento ed allattenzione medica in particolare quando crescono e diventano adolescenti ed adulti
1689581 running in place troppe persone still in urgent need of hiv aids treatment
1689582 der fund von perchloraten ist weder ein gutes noch ein schlechtes zeichen f r m gliches leben wird aber dazu f hren dass wir unsere vorstellungen ber leben auf dem mars neu berdenken m ssen
1689583 wir haben uns dazu entschieden obwohl wir mit der datensammlung und analyse erst zu 50 prozent fertig sind
1689584 noch m ssen weitere daten gewonnen und ausgewertet sowie erg nzende laboruntersuchungen gemacht werden
1689585 wir haben uns entschieden der ffentlichkeit wissenschaft in aktion zu zeigen weil es so ein gro es interesse an der mission gibt die ja schlie lich nach lebensfreundlichen bedingungen in der nordpolarregion sucht bislang wissen wir nicht ob der fund von perchloraten eine gute oder schlechte nachricht f r leben auf dem mars ist
1689586 h tten wir das entdeckt w ren wir uns absolut sicher gewesen
1689587 aber vielleicht haben wir es mit perchloraten zu tun die kein chlorgas freisetzen wenn sie erhitzt werden
1689588 we have attempted to show all known claims agreed boundaries and one thing that has not appeared on any other maps which is the number of areas that could be claimed by canada denmark and the us
1689589 we are talking 90 million barrels of oil nearly 17 hundred trillion cubic feet
1689590 i suppose for any state control over hydrocarbons is significant as other resources dwindle
1689591 the other factor is the melting of the polar ice and that is making it easier to explore the area which is why the oil and gas industry is looking at it
1689592 it is now becoming a potential area of development rather than a hypothetical one
1689593 it is vulnerable and extracting oil and gas is not an environmentally friendly activity
1689594 i think jay is a great acquisition for us and were still on the look out for more
1689595 hes had maybe one or two seasons where people say hes not fulfilled his potential
1689596 hopefully we can turn that around for him we seem to be a club that thrives on doing that with players
1689597 i think hes a quality player and hed give us something we havent got and would bring great competition
1689598 as the understanding of this phenomenon becomes more and more sophisticated we can expect its application in politics and business to become equally sophisticated by creating backlash in unusual ways and playing to peoples resentments about being called on their resentments
1689599 boy i feel sorry for these bastards how are they ever going to live down the fact we beat them
1689600 it will be difficult to break the top 4 for example i say ignore him and move on
1689601 hes an al qaeda warrior he has wounded and the people he has worked with have wounded the world
1689602 we will capture or kill osama bin laden some day you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general
1689603 a trial that depends on handicapping the defense cant possibly be fair
1689604 the military judge tried at times to mitigate the commissions most unjust rules but the flaws in the system won out
1689605 whatever kind of work you do or whatever ridiculous outfits you wear make sure that you have pretty underwear on
1689606 this set hits you at your natural waist so you wont want to wear it with your low riders i prefer to wear mine under my wrap dress but any dress will work fine you could also pair this with a high waist skirt and allow the lace to peek out a bit
1689607 the countdown has officially begun mark your calendars september 18th is the day of reckoning
1689608 for the last three years the entire team at mythic has poured their hearts into making warhammer online the next great mmorpg we are so excited to open up this world and share it with the fans that will live in it quest in it go to war in it and make it come alive

1689621 we are delighted to have an institutional investor of the calibre of credit suisse following last months granting of consent for our plant at stallingborough

1689623 they looked totally in love nancy jumped at the chance to take a picture of paul with us they told us they were on a trip and going to st louis before heading west no one could believe it was really him he was so laidback and ordinary
1689624 it is not true to say thaksin shinawatra is selling manchester city
1689625 he spoke with garry cook this morning and those were the sentiments he echoed in very strong terms
1689626 i would still like to strengthen and im confident well bring in at least two possibly three more faces
1689627 and if those players are of the quality of the likes of gutierrez and guthrie then well take our chances
1689628 by the time we play valencia on saturday and then manchester united a week later i would think we will be pretty much full strength apart from maybe mark viduka
1689629 there is competition for places which drives you on but until you are at the stage when you are not needed then you have to move on
1689630 ive not felt like that but who knows what the future holds or when your time is up at united
1689631 the manager decides that or if you feel you are not helping the team or playing enough games and then it is time to go
1689632 chelsea fc condemns all forms of discrimination in football and society
1689633 such allegations against our club are extremely serious and chelsea will not be making any further comment until we have assessed all the implications of the charge
1689634 we are working on a new uk anti doping agency and legislation is certainly a possibility
1689635 that is something we are currently discussing with our home office that is something that could be evolving in the next couple of years
1689636 there are discussions between uk sport which is changing its anti doping role the home office and the police about how this might be taken forward and legislation is one of the areas that might be looked at
1689637 im going to go with four fast bowlers and monty panesar
1689638 i think it is an aggressive move a positive move we need to take 20 wickets in this test you need to take 20 in any test and i feel a lot more comfortable with four fast bowlers
1689639 weve given responsibility to the batters to score runs with colly paul collingwood at five freddie andrew flintoff at six timmy ambrose seven and broad eight
1689640 i like steve and what he brings to the team hes had his ups and downs but i have a really good relationship with steve
1689641 he seems as excited as anything and he had a bit of a bounce in his step
1689642 im very happy to sign for fulham ive already spent three weeks with the team and we have a very good squad for the new season
1689643 i know they had a very hard season last year but im confident that this season it will be much much better im coming here to be successful
1689644 i know also the situation here with the goalkeepers ive known mark schwarzer for a long time and played against him in the past i know hes the number one but im here to give my best
1689645 i am distraught it was only yesterday that i found out that it was all over so it hasnt really sunk in yet
1689646 i just cannot put any pressure on the knee without it collapsing
1689647 although im bitterly disappointed i think ill look back on my career and feel incredibly fortunate to have played alongside some truly great players
1689648 i won 12 trophies during my time at leicester there was a five year period when we won everything there was to win we were the manchester united of rugby and i count myself very lucky to have been a part of that
1689649 i want to express my thanks to gloucester for all the care and support the club has given me and for the help they have pledged to keep giving me
1689650 leon is a fantastic professional a model for anyone wanting to reach the top in the sport and i thank him for the contribution he made to the squad last season
1689651 i was blown away when i was told it was a big surprise and a huge honour its fantastic
1689652 some of the most wonderful names in british sport have been olympic flag bearers
1689653 i really wanted to be picked but i didnt totally believe i would be
1689654 making the olympic games this time around was fantastic in itself but this has really topped it off its phenomenal
1689655 i made the commonwealth games in 1986 at the age of 16 so now im here at the grand old age of 38
1689656 its interesting going through the different scenarios from being one of the sheep and following and learning from the older more experienced swimmers to being one of the experienced swimmers and being looked up to and not watching your every move but they want to learn from you
1689657 i hope i set a positive example i really really am enjoying the experience
1689658 i didnt expect after missing out on athens to be here eight years on from my last olympic appearance
1689659 ive mellowed in my old age definitely im more experienced and the expectations are different too
1689660 when i was younger especially going to the games in seoul walking into the village i was like a rabbit in headlights i was trying to take everything in how big and massive everything was and i just got a little carried away
1689661 i didnt really focus on what i was there for whereas now im more experienced and im here to do a job and hopefully lead by example
1689662 in july i went under 22 seconds for the first time albeit in the new suit which i do think does make a difference
1689663 i came second in manchester and that was 0 10 slower than my fastest time so im in and around the best shape ive ever have been
1689664 i think i have learnt a lot over the years i do a lot more quality rather than quantity now during that two years break i kept myself in shape i went into the gym two or three times a week and just swum once or twice every month i enjoy going into the water so i kept myself in shape
1689665 i think mentally im a lot stronger but also there are other things in my life its not the be all and end all to me now were before i put so much stress on myself thats not saying i dont go into every race wanting to win every race but im a lot more relaxed about it
1689666 expectations would be to make the semi finals first of all make the top 16
1689667 i know world records have tumbled this year with the new technology but whats happening is that swimming isnt necessarily getting faster but the depth is getting so much deeper
1689668 in the 50 freestyle half a second will probably separate the first 16 so if you make it through to the top 16 then there is a chance to make it into the final and in the final anything can happen
1689669 we have to be a little bit patient i keep saying there are three positions i think we need strengthening in terms of cover or to challenge the players in them positions
1689670 we are trying extremely hard to make some signings but clubs do not want to sell their good players and i understand that
1689671 if somebody comes in for my good players it would have to be a very good offer for you to even consider it
1689672 we are trying hard but obviously the season is coming up very quickly
1689673 we have been linked with hundreds of players and i think it is unfair to comment on players who are under contract at clubs
1689674 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team
1689675 it showed us in no uncertain terms we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia
1689676 you can never under estimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year
1689677 who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident we wont be taking anything for granted
1689678 i know everybody will be working flat out to make sure we can be strong in all the remaining races
1689679 ive had a look at some onboard footage of the track and will be working with the team over the break to prepare for the event
1689680 from the footage the track looks amazing i love street circuits but this one looks extremely fast and unforgiving in some places
1689681 as a driver its always fun to go to a new circuit i really enjoy driving at new places and feel confident i can pick up new circuits quickly
1689682 what we would define as success this season is always a difficult question to answer
1689683 but it is clear there are two trophies we are focused on the premier league and the champions league
1689684 after that the fa cup but we will never go seriously for the carling cup again this year we will have the same philosophy on the carling cup
1689685 the premier league and champions league are the trophies we will fight for
1689686 we want to give hope and belief to all our supporters ahead of the new season and we know we can only do that if we play our usual game full of quality
1689687 it is not wrong to call arsenal a young side still but it is wrong to call us inexperienced
1689688 cesc fabregas for example has already played in a fa cup final a champions league final and also now a european championships final so you cannot say he has no experience
1689689 we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1689690 i didnt know he wasnt doing it its news to me
1689691 its not easy by any means hes a fun competitor to race against ive raced against him a few times four years ago i raced against him in athens and then last year as well
1689692 its disappointing a little bit but he has his focus and i have mine hes not the only person competing in that race and the rest of the field is a pretty strong field
1689693 im just going through doing what i have to do preparing myself as best as i can so i can swim as fast as i can
1689694 thats my goal and thats what im going to stick with i havent said anything about breaking any record or going after any record i just want to go out there and try something that i want to do a goal of mine
1689695 my goals havent been published bob bowman phelps coach and i are the only ones who know them and were going to work through this next week and a half and try to complete them all
1689696 ive been able to bounce back from my wrist injury earlier in the year
1689697 it wasnt easy but having bob and my trainer always working on it and finding exercises to stay in some kind of shape so that when i got back into the water everything was fine
1689698 we were able to work through everything pretty good and i remember saying at trials to bob that i think with the circumstances we had the past year it hasnt been a bad year so far
1689699 i swam in rome and paris did a few meets and did some okay times the best mid season times ive ever done so im pretty pleased
1689700 obviously breaking the world record in the 50 backstroke shows my speed but im just enjoying what im doing its not all about the process at the moment ive been enjoying my process and i believe what im doing is going to get the best on the day in the 100
1689701 holding the 50m world record im going to be out there at the 50 and hopefully pushing the big guys
1689702 im just excited to be here competing against the best in the world and im just going to have to see what happens
1689703 its been an exciting year for me to be honest
1689704 ive had a good run up in my senior career from 2005 but 2008 has been a bit different
1689705 i pre qualified in the 100 backstroke from the 2007 world championships so i didnt actually have to do it at the trials
1689706 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1689707 serve a useful function to convince the markets that the fed remains concerned about inflation potential
1689708 it does two things offensively it allows us to add a little more punch to our lineup it allows ryan to go down and get his at bats
1689709 we want to assure the public that this scheme never put any patrons or the public in danger and this amounted to a system where a single employee had decided to help a group of players cheat at the table games
1689710 we will be pushing for full prosecution of all those involved in this theft

1689721 we wouldnt beat galway with the performance we gave against monaghan
1689722 galway under liam sammon are an excellent outfit and they play open attacking football something we will have to combat on saturday they deserved their connacht final win and we will have to move up several gears if were to progress in the championship
1689723 obviously galway pose a different threat to monaghan but we have players with big experience who can adapt quickly and thats what well have to do
1689724 its not an easy game but then there are none at this stage of the championship
1689725 armagh have a great tradition they have been the dominant side in ulster over the last 10 years
1689726 theyve won seven titles since 1999 which is a remarkable achievement theyre a very strong team and were going to have to make sure our tactics are right on the day
1689727 there was a round of club fixtures on the wednesday after the dublin match and that was good because it took their minds off it and got them back playing competitive games
1689728 this is our fourth visit to croke park this year already we only played in wexford park four times weve played as many times in croke park as we have in our own home pitch its mad
1689729 one of our goals at the start of this year was to get this far weve now achieved that and hopefully we can push on from there
1689730 it was all about energy effort and hard work we fell three points behind in the second half but there was no panic among the players who showed great heart to battle back against a very good mayo side
1689731 after the wicklow game we drew a line in the sand and said enough is enough
1689732 regardless of the opposition over the last couple of years our performances have been poor and that was the biggest disappointment ninety per cent of people out there looking at us today would say we are going to win nothing and thats okay it suits us
1689733 it often takes something like a save or maybe a block to change a game
1689734 and after the wicklow game you wouldnt have expected to be in the all ireland quarter finals
1689735 but in fairness to the lads we kept focussed afterwards we said wed take one game at a time and here we are in the quarter finals after beating fermanagh by 0 11 to 0 5

1689745 its a bit weird that triple jump is an olympic sport its one of the more unlikely events in the games
1689746 yet its got such a high profile it was jonathan who really helped give it that profile
1689747 before his era it wasnt as big an event even though in the past weve had great triple jumpers in this country and elsewhere in the world
1689748 but jonathan took it to another level which was good for me because it set a standard of what i need to achieve and where i need to go
1689749 when i first started doing it i found it fun i used to play basketball and so had really good spacial awareness
1689750 in pe other kids couldnt get a hang on triple jumping but it came naturally to me
1689751 when you nail that big jump everything seems so slow
1689752 you cant hear anything youre just in the air and it feels like youre up there for ages
1689753 you only get to experience that feeling a few times you know when you nail a big one its hard to explain
1689754 i put on a swagger after a big jump thats not to psyche out other guys thats just me because i feel good
1689755 its not to intimidate other guys my distances should do that for me
1689756 jonathan was a strong guy his body to weight ratio was very good
1689757 he could clean a lot more than i could and he was a lot lighter that was an advantage for him
1689758 he had speed on the runway although im probably quicker now technically he was better than i was or maybe still am
1689759 ive had to work hard on my bodyweight making sure im not carrying any excess fluids
1689760 im weighing 86kgs and i should be 84kgs low in beijing last year i was 90kgs but when i was working with by nutritionist i got it down to 87kgs for the world championships in osaka
1689761 ohmygawd there are still a kazillion things on my list of things to do
1689762 the team have played together in a number of games now theyve been doing very well and i believe in them
1689763 we had active fires spread but nothing that we hadnt previously experienced
1689764 but then here came august then things started to really pick up and go
1689765 you would come out of working in the field looking like a chimney sweep just black everywhere
1689766 we didnt expect the ground vegetation to return as quickly as it did i think we were as influenced by how it looked visually in 1988 as everybody else was
1689767 we had areas where you could walk hundreds of meters trying to find a seedling of a tree and other places where if you put your foot down you squashed fifty of them
1689768 we had no idea that the presence of that trait would vary so much spatially across the landscape
1689769 she excels at getting the right team of people together to address complex questions about landscapes
1689770 whats going to happen to these patches of seedlings as they grow up
1689771 a series of fires like the ones in 1988 obviously they shape the landscape today
1689772 but theyll probably leave their mark for at least two hundred years
1689773 that whole programmatic let it be approach could have been shut down from the highest levels of government
1689774 they could have reverted back to policies that were implemented early in the 1900s
1689775 this type of severe large fire is the natural fire regime in yellowstone
1689776 the forests have burned in this way since the pleistocene so for the past ten thousand years in intervals of one hundred to four hundred years or so
1689777 the fires of yellowstone provided opportunities to study things at scales that ecologists simply hadnt worked at before
1689778 theres a relatively narrow window where you can effectively suppress fires
1689779 i think the educational component of the fires of 88 was a positive influence on society and really resulted in a lot of peoples curiosity
1689780 it really heightened their awareness and understanding of fire ecology
1689781 in 1988 it was so dry it was the driest summer ever recorded there winds of sixty miles an hour and the fuels were burning so intensely it didnt matter if there was a lot of fuel or a little fuel it didnt matter if the forest was young or old it didnt matter if there was a road in the way it didnt matter if the grand canyon of the yellowstone was in the way the fires just blew across the canyon
1689782 they were really a weather climate driven phenomenon and thats true for this type of system
1689783 from what we learned in 1988 can we predict what happened in this burn in 2000
1689784 and how well does our knowledge transfer what things are the same what things are different and why
1689785 contributes greatly to a fundamental understanding of how these systems work and that is important because it helps feed into making management decisions
1689786 what works or is prescribed in one area may not fit to be prescribed in another area
1689787 theres no ecological rationale for implementing a particular treatment especially at the landscape level but management activities can fit and dovetail with ecological considerations
1689788 so many of the questions that we face in ecology and the environmental sciences are about phenomena that occur over a large area whether its changing land use patterns or climate change
1689789 the fires of yellowstone provided opportunities to study things at scales that ecologists simply hadnt worked at before
1689790 for years people just assumed that if you had a bark beetle outbreak that meant a fire was almost certain to happen
1689791 monicas work and the work of her collaborators have shown that its a lot more complicated than that theres a lot more heterogeneity in the response due to the landscape due to weather due to a variety of factors
1689792 after fire or after insects the trees are killed but the wood is still sound
1689793 it sometimes is argued that by harvesting the wood youll reduce the likelihood of a subsequent disturbance but there are very few data on that
1689794 theres a mismatch between public perception of these interactions and the evidence
1689795 from a management and conservation perspective anything that crosses ecosystem boundaries has a better chance of being sustainable
1689796 most of yellowstone is very wilderness like in character and hasnt been very strongly affected by management
1689797 those properties give us the opportunity to understand the baseline conditions of how our ecosystems are responding even to big drivers like global climate change in the absence of the much more intensive modifications that characterize so much of our landscapes
1689798 we learn a lot about the mechanisms of nature without our intervention how does it work how does it recover from events like this how does that help us manage landscapes where we do have more of an impact and what does that mean for the future
1689799 fire frequency is likely to increase not only in yellowstone but throughout the west
1689800 long term studies like ours may help us understand what we can expect in the future
1689801 we were really surprised that the system without any intervention from us recovered very quickly its much more resilient than anyone expected
1689802 the soul had a share of that which is high and the body a share of that which is low it was formed of a mixture of heavy clay and pure spirit by this mixing man became the most astonishing of mysteries many know the surface of the ocean but they understand nothing of its depths
1689803 the plan now is to try and get out of the laois match because i dont think its realistic or fair to ask men to do six weeks in a row like these men have done
1689804 any committee or body who would insist on that are wrong these men deserve a rest
1689805 im going to ask the county board to request a postponement and if we dont get that well go on and well beat laois i think these lads deserve a rest at this stage and we deserve a rest
1689806 weve been north south east and west in newry tralee castlebar and tullamore i think we need one
1689807 cork have had a tough run in compared to kilkenny sure but personally i like to have less tough matches
1689808 when youre playing tough matches all the time you pick up knocks and then you need to motivate yourself too
1689809 we have to stop these guys winning three in a row
1689810 kilkenny seem to be getting a little bit of stick because they are so strong in leinster but then wexford and offaly both showed against waterford and limerick that theyre good teams
1689811 theres a kind of intimidation thing with kilkenny in leinster
1689812 i think cork will be underdogs and that will suit them and i think from positions 8 15 on the pitch theyre very strong
1689813 players like pa cronin and sean g are formidable and ive been very impressed with their two corner backs as well
1689814 i dont see them putting high balls into their forwards i think theyll run at kilkenny or try and deliver the ball in low
1689815 on the other side then id see kilkenny putting high balls in on top of henry shefflin martin comerford and eddie brennan cork dont score many goals and kilkenny do
1689816 look were delighted to be involved in such a clash itll be a marvellous occasion with a packed croke park but our players have been there before and it didnt affect us then
1689817 the experience the players learned from past meetings with dublin in croke park will hopefully stand to us and we know that on our day were a match for any side
1689818 weve had some poor patches in games in the championship to date losing big leads if we do that against dublin theyll punish us we still lack a bit of consistency but the lads will be really up for this game and as were improving then were harder to beat
1689819 since january the dole queues have been growing by 1 500 per week but the government has shown no sign of having any plan or any sense of urgency
1689820 the government must put together a co ordinated response through f s the further education sector the institutes of technologies and other agencies involved in education and training to start responding to this need
1689821 when people sign on the live register they refer to us after three months so far theres been a very strong number who have left the register once they have come to us around 60 per cent
1689822 carlow dont have many good days but im hoping well have more of them in the future im a proud man im proud of myself my family my club and above all my county
1689823 were a proud family but there are 30 brothers on that team theres some of us blood brothers but were all brothers in the one code carlow hurling
1689824 the three of us being brothers will always have its moments in any team i am proud of that but im proud of all of carlow
1689825 the 100 caps made it special leo mcgough always said to me youll get the century and then youll lift the christy ring i said to leo ill talk to you about that if we win it makes it special to have the 100 appearances there and its a great feel ing
1689826 i felt a little nervy going into extra time but i knew we were going to get at least ten good minutes out of our guys
1689827 we were stiff theres no point saying we werent we had cramp but we came from behind in most games during the year there was someone looking down on us today someone looked down on us last week and there was someone looking down on us the whole year
1689828 theres an inner belief in this team there are guys like jim greene who have come in they have the ability they have the spark and they know how to win it we just believed in ourselves
1689829 we nearly had it last year we nearly had it the year before we sat down in the dressing room and said we were the second best team in the christy ring and its not good enough anymore
1689830 maybe tonight maybe tomorrow as long as we can celebrate this ill have some bit of a voice left so that i can thank people from the bottom of my heart for travelling around the country
1689831 they went north south east and west with us and you heard them today when we were on the back foot they lived with us through this
1689832 this new facility is a result of the dedication to create an unparalleled centre of excellence in small animal orthopaedics in the south east of england
1689833 ultimately we strive to make the seemingly impossible truly possible and thats what matters the most
1689834 every single case that comes in you can make a dramatic difference in it
1689835 i will leave no stone unturned when it comes to new procedures
1689836 our belief is that we will set new standards in veterinary education on a global scale
1689837 my dream was to build a place where we could truly care for animals and provide the best care available anywhere in the world
1689838 the only thing i ever won as a player was the championship in switzerland with neuch tel in the last season when i was captain because it was the most recent it comes to mind but i still think my first senior cap was very special for me
1689839 as a kid i used to go to dalymount i would get there an hour before kick off to get a position and watch the players line up for the national anthem
1689840 i dreamt that one day that would be me and then obviously my first cap was the realisation of that
1689841 i would say that every time i pulled on the green shirt was a highlight particularly when you stand for the national anthem for me that meant a hell of a lot
1689842 im not sure today that young players have a real love for the game as i did and people that i mixed with did
1689843 i think they want to be footballers because of what it brings the trappings that come now with being footballers are wonderful for them and im not knocking it but there is a bit of a love for the game missing
1689844 theres an awful lot of our young players who never go and watch football matches
1689845 now people might think im old fashioned but god almighty if youre a young player how can you not learn by going to the top teams to watch the best players
1689846 maybe thats the youth of today not only in football they just expect
1689847 if we are away in a hotel and real madrid v barcelona is on sky they dont bother about that but if i say dinner is at 7 30 lads somebody will come and say to me can we have it at 8 because well miss eastenders
1689848 i think the most i earned at qpr was 200 a week i never earned more than 300 a week admittedly back in the 70s it wasnt bad im not complaining
1689849 i would have thought that the players would have thought much the same i did which is i didnt think very much of what happened
1689850 for a lad to have lied basically about both of his grandmothers i mean that to me was incredible
1689851 i think he had to get home i think what it turned out to be was a family situation that had turned tricky
1689852 all he do was say to steve staunton listen ive got a problem i need to get home for a day and that would have been sorted
1689853 there was a little bit of time before the next game so he could have gone back hopefully have got it sorted and come back
1689854 it went wrong he did what he did and since then he hasnt been seen
1689855 i dont believe i should have to talk a 20 year old into playing for his country
1689856 if he wants to play let him come and play but dont have me driving up the motorway for him to say to me no
1689857 he needs to sort himself we could do with him definitely but i think a bit of movement needs to come from that side
1689858 this will go down as one of the great hurling games of this year or any year
1689859 i want to commiserate westmeath they really came back from the dead and i want to commiserate with them
1689860 if i felt it would benefit me id do it
1689861 but right now i dont think theres the right place for me the girls in britain are a good bit behind me and with the drugs background in some countries thats something you dont want to get involved in
1689862 you dont want to be heading to a particular country and improving and people say oh i wonder why you dont want to hear that
1689863 i have worked really hard over the last eight months focusing on the daily processes in order to run to my potential in august
1689864 it will be my first olympics and it will definitely be a dream come true
1689865 a scene similar to the jamaican bobsleigh team considering ireland does not have a velodrome track
1689866 we have a really top class combination here that can hold its own with any in the world
1689867 denis and the horse are at the peak of their form and if they can maintain this until august then ireland will be very competitive in hong kong
1689868 the thing i should do now is sit down because im absolutely fatigued
1689869 were after playing ten matches i think honestly it feels like were after playing three there we won two and lost one out there
1689870 the biggest problem at the interval between normal time and extra time was to convince them we hadnt lost the match
1689871 it very much felt like we had lost the match didnt it
1689872 the momentum was with westmeath big time at that stage and our momentum was gone so to come back up was beyond character
1689873 we chose to play against the wind twice it was a big risk but we trust these fellas fitness levels we had our work done in training and we knew wed be fitter
1689874 john did phenomenal stuff with the lads particularly in the winter
1689875 overall were absolutely thrilled for them they deserve this more than anyone anyone who wins matches in ireland this weekend doesnt deserve what these lads have got these deserve it more
1689876 i think it was up here pointing to the goalposts when they got a 65 and they dropped it in low and we cleared it i think it was there and we knew it then when they didnt take the point they tried to take a point then and couldnt
1689877 we were six points up with two minutes to go in the proper match it was a tough game a tough one to win but weve done it

1689911 i didnt realise ireland was as big until i came to c arlow and ended up in every corner from newry to tralee to castlebar
1689912 mommy is it safe to come out yet is the pee pee gone
1689913 johns widow michelle called me to break the sad news
1689914 john was a great friend we kept in regular contact after working together for 19 years and i miss him terribly
1689915 it seems he had grown unwell and on the day he died he had agreed to visit the accident and emergency department if michelle bought him a book he loved books
1689916 but when michelle returned from the bookshop she found john had already passed away its an awful shock
1689917 having grown up in northern ireland and having been educated following what was a british based curriculum one had had scant exposure to the irish republic
1689918 the culture shock came with the fierce ethnicity of the paper
1689919 i had had no idea that there were so many millions of irish people living in england not merely the immigrant hordes but the second or third generations who stoutly maintained their irish heritage
1689920 mac lua was an astonishing character short stocky black haired with ferocious black eyebrows a volcanic temper he was the irish post
1689921 it could be said of mccaughey that he put his talent into journalism and his genius into his dinner parties
1689922 he was a great journalist with a reverence for a well turned phrase and an intuitive understanding that you could write commercial and industrial news with flair passion and humour
1689923 he was good at his work and brilliant at his play
1689924 trading conditions have been difficult in q1 as we suffered the loss of easter and the impact of higher fuel prices
1689925 oil prices almost doubled in q1 from 61 to 117 a barrel as our fuel bill rose 93 per cent to 367million fuel now represents almost 50 per cent of our total operating costs compared to 36 per cent last year
1689926 it does suggest a lesser ability to pass on fuel costs to the passenger than the market would have anticipated
1689927 terry is absolutely delighted and were really very proud of him we got the news on may 22 and i think its a great achievement
1689928 i came over here when times were hard and we had five children thankfully theyve all done really well for themselves
1689929 this was always a dream for terry and my late husband jim always helped him out a great deal with his studies
1689930 he always said if youre going to be a judge be a good one and i think that was good advice
1689931 persistent url direct linking to full text articles and other documents in sterne library databases
1689932 i felt a little nervy going into extra time but i knew we were going to get at least ten good minutes out of our guys
1689933 we were stiff theres no point saying we werent we had cramp but we came from behind in most games during the year there was someone looking down on us today someone looked down on us last week and there was someone looking down on us the whole year
1689934 didnt realise ireland was as big until i came to carlow and ended up in every corner from newry to tralee to castlebar
1689935 we are only opening the door for ye carlow youngsters we hope ye all burst through and go on to greater things
1689936 the quality of products in the competition is top class its a bit like the oscars in that theres no other competition like this in ireland or the uk you compete against the top people in their divisions you are competing against the best its stiff competition
1689937 in 2001 we saw an opportunity to make waffle biscuits
1689938 but it wasnt long before customers were looking for more they were always asking have you something new its a never ending saga of us looking at what we do and trying to improve we are a small company and we all work together everyone in the company is very important
1689939 he worked for the good of the area for 33 years he was known around the area as mr planning because if you were having trouble getting planning permission or anything like that michael was the man to call
1689940 i dont think ill ever get closure how can i
1689941 i read in the papers that they said there was no drink drugs or speed involved but only two people know what speed that man was doing him and me and now i cant give my side of the story
1689942 that man could have mown three people off the road but nothing would have been done because they got rid of the tyres if i was a guards wife would this have happened would i be going through all of this people have not acted responsibly throughout this case it has all been passed over
1689943 i know that man didnt go out to kill anyone that day
1689944 ive never seen him no cards no flowers he didnt come to the funeral not a word never said one word as if he had nothing to do with it
1689945 belinda is a lovely young girl and these comments made about her are just disgusting
1689946 its outrageous and very disappointing that this came from irish people the economy in ireland survives on people from all other nations they have to grow up
1689947 she is a bright girl and i think she has a good chance at tralee the fact that she is there now is very timely yes she looks different to the usual irish candidate but that can be a very good thing
1689948 i think its a very appropriate time for someone like belinda to be in this competition
1689949 i was delighted when a friend of mine put me in touch with paul costelloe
1689950 i was having trouble finding a dress as i dont really wear them and am not into girly things but when i got to his studio and started trying on from pauls collection i knew i was in the right place
1689951 his work is much more me and i ended up with the choice of two lovely dresses
1689952 i only chose one as i wouldnt want to be greedy but it is lovely thats all im saying at this stage
1689953 i am always wary of getting involved with these competitions as it can be hard to find something perfect for the girls as they are not in a beauty pageant so come in all shapes and sizes
1689954 but belinda was no challenge it was so easy to dress her it was great
1689955 the fact that she is wearing it is good for both of us
1689956 im glad to support belinda in the competition and hope she does very well
1689957 while its great to be wearing one of pauls creations it was also a pleasure to meet the man himself he has been very generous i think he sees it as one irish person helping another out
1689958 my cousin kathy de stafford is making my dress for me
1689959 she designed it especially for the event and also made rosanna davidson miss worlds dress
1689960 its a beautiful dress and i was so excited to wear it its the nicest piece of clothing i have ever worn and i feel so special in it
1689961 it wasnt even finished the last time i put it on and it was still the most beautiful dress id ever worn
1689962 so im really excited about it and so grateful to kathy herself and all her staff are amazing and they have been so supportive
1689963 ive wasted the last few weeks looking for a sponsor for my dress
1689964 in the end i just found a local dressmaker and told her what i was looking for
1689965 i drew the design and its being made as we speak
1689966 ive had to buy a lot of outfits for the occasion but thats the fun part
1689967 i was thrilled to come across this dress in sligo while on a visit and hope it brings me luck
1689968 we were told that we would have to apply to the garda for permission and they would then decide how many members were needed at the gig and we would be charged around 90 per garda per hour
1689969 we just wanted to give kids something to do that wasnt in a pub
1689970 last year was our first year and we organised it with the help of carlow regional youth services we just bring in young carlow bands and give them an opportunity to get on stage and show people what they can do
1689971 we did bag packing in supervalu and super quinn and we managed to get enough money to cover the insurance so as far as we were concerned everything was okay to go
1689972 its very unlikely that we can hold it now we had no idea about new regulations before this there is no way we can afford to give the guards that much money its really disappointing
1689973 we had no trouble last year and we just wanted to give young people in carlow something to do
1689974 from what i can gather the guards were sick of covering events like electric picnic and oxegen for free so they brought in the new regulations but i suppose it just ends up hitting small free events like ours too
1689975 this event is growing year on year and the turnout increases each time
1689976 a lot of the locals now plan their holidays around this festival so they dont miss out
1689977 and theres even more than usual for the children with two different tents to keep them amused
1689978 if everything goes according to plan this years will be the biggest and best yet
1689979 britain and ireland are experiencing a lot of the same problems right now
1689980 particularly rising food fuel and energy prices and i suppose the one difference that sets them apart is that brown is already under threat from within his own party while fianna f il will give brian cowan the opportunity to ride out the storm
1689981 each has a lot of experience in finance brown the former chancellor of the exchequer and cowen the former minster for finance but its not helping either much at the moment
1689982 the loss of the labour seat in glasgow was a major blow to gordon brown and brian cowen can take some comfort from the fact that were not due a general election in ireland until 2012
1689983 the banking system in britain is under much more pressure than ireland but then our problems stem from an over reliance on the construction sector and a lot of businesses in london will find work when the redevelopment for the olympic projects start
1689984 and theyve never managed that easy smiling charm which bertie ahern and tony blair had
1689985 they cowen and brown would have been seen as very able politicians before they became leaders and while ahern was grooming cowen as his successor the opposite was probably true for tony blair
1689986 while the number of children treated with stimulants for adhd has fallen by 2671 since 2004 the number of adults treated with stimulants for adhd has increased by 693 over the same period
1689987 i thought adhd not so bad ill give him a pill hell be fine
1689988 i just hope the bloke and his manager david riolo decide to agree with the proposal that we have put to him because it provides him with an opportunity to get his life and career back in order
1689989 ive had a bit to do with todd and hes a good kid
1689990 he couldnt have been any better than he was in the country camp but it is clear from other things that have happened that he has a few issues to do with alcohol that he needs to address
1689991 that part of the penalty that deals with his intake of alcohol is the most important part of the plan in my view
1689992 i think todd should accept the penalty i think the five point plan protects the player as much as it does the club and gives him an opportunity to get himself right anyone with the track record todd has must realise he cant afford to do anything silly or irresponsible
1689993 two years off the drink isnt a bad option i think hes got a contract reportedly worth 400 000 a year so hes got a commitment to the club he may feel a bit hard done by but thats the proposition that is in front of him and i dont think hes got a lot of options
1689994 my advice to him would be to accept it and prove to everyone that he can come back next season as a stronger person and maybe an even better player as well hopefully he feels that way too and accepts that he has got a responsibility i would much prefer todd reaches his potential and i think this is the way for him to move forward
1689995 i understand the bulldogs disappointment but if he wasnt playing with toulon he would have joined another rugby team for example saracens
1689996 he plans to stay in rugby if we didnt feel that he was highly motivated to play rugby we would not have started negotiations with him
1689997 he had seen everything in rugby league he wants to try a new adventure with rugby it is his choice his deal is not worth the exorbitant amounts that have been claimed it is a sporting choice
1689998 this transfer was most complicated to realise because we knew that the news in the media would be enormous
1689999 when i saw the transfer of mark gasnier to stade francais and people spoke about him like he was the star that amused me because in france we have a real ignorance of rugby league because sonny bill williams is the uncontested star
