70000 even when you go to t shirt shops you just see more cubs shirts than white sox
70001 i stocked up back in october on soto cards and his stuff is selling great
70002 everywhere you look in chicago someone is trying to sell something with fukudome on it
70003 the local card shop has a box of new cubs and i dont ever see anyone taking any cards out of it
70004 any old cub from the 1950s and 60s is selling like hotcakes on ebay
70005 the cubs and sox are not fueling sales for me
70006 i would imagine it helps a lot of other dealers but well probably get a bigger turnout at the national because of the cubs
70007 i know it is going to happen because i recently caught a foul ball at a game for the first time in my life
70008 soto theriot and fukudome are selling hot and we always do well with ron santo
70009 he was an outgoing friendly guy who knew everyone in the community
70010 i never saw him treat anyone with anything but respect and dignity he was just a good decent guy
70011 they did building searches and tracking judge would blow in jerrys ear to wake him up when it was time to go work except that he didnt understand when it was vacation time
70012 he was that kind of guy he was concerned about the well being of his own family but that extended to his police family as well
70013 he was a guy you could go to with questions about the job
70014 he had a lot of institutional knowledge with what had done on in the department that you couldnt read in a book
70015 its no secret that we get a lot of complaints in there and we are using national night out to send a clear message
70016 the message is the neighborhood and police department have organized and we will fight back
70017 we have been a part of this event and are maintaining the tradition that was started in the past

70022 it certainly is an issue nobody wants to start with a deficit next year

70025 pakistans intelligence service has had a longstanding relationship with al qaeda turning a blind eye to growing ties between osama bin laden and the taliban
70026 american intelligence agencies have concluded that members of pakistans powerful spy service isi helped plan the deadly july 7 bombing of indias embassy in kabul afghanistan according to united states government officials
70027 the conclusion about isis involvement was based on intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack on indian embassy in kabul the officials said providing the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
70028 the american officials also said there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistans tribal areas
70029 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong

70031 but the fragments cannot demonstrate the full picture of the spectacular opening ceremony
70032 nobody stopped us when we entered the main stadium on monday chinese officials let us in after we showed our id cards and we shot the rehearsal
70033 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention

70038 congressman hill said he wanted to elevate the level of discourse during this campaign so my proposal to him will help accomplish that
70039 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
70040 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
70041 this is an area that not that long ago was a zone that nobody could move freely in
70042 we see our aussie friends doing a great job here
70043 our aggressive patrolling coupled with international security assistance force air and ground support pushed the insurgents onto the defensive
70044 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections
70045 we are not worried by the change in israeli prime minister because we know that israel is seriously engaged to remain involved in the negotiation process with the palestinians

70047 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
70048 the olmert who spoke yesterday from the garden of his compound in jerusalem was a crushed and battered man tainted by allegations lacking public trust or a sympathetic ear
70049 this government has finished its mission irrespective of who will head kadima
70050 i think the local derby tends to make a great game whether youre going good or bad but both teams are travelling very well this season
70051 both probably expect to win the game and this time around its probably a top four battle
70052 we could probably upset our season if we lose or grab a bit of confidence by beating them
70053 im pretty happy for us to cruise by and let the other teams get talked about
70054 it doesnt really bother us we can just sit in the background and hopefully creep up on a few teams
70055 the stats show that the games are always very close and we dont expect it to be any different
70056 our team can still improve if you are 30 or 31 you are not old
70057 claude makelele was 34 and played well last season this sort of banter occurs between people during the summer
70058 it is different you know someone for a few moments but now we are together every day and i am looking forward to it
70059 we have only talked for a few minutes since he took over but he is a nice person he is a successful coach and that is why he is here
70060 he has not spoken to me about his philosophy but we have a good squad like last year and we can play a lot of systems
70061 it would be fantastic if he could stay at chelsea
70062 he is a big player for the club and has done a lot for the club but it is up to him he knows we are all behind him
70063 he is out for two weeks minimum for treatment and he wont be able to play for three weeks
70064 at the moment he is out of the first game against portsmouth i have players who can cover
70065 you cant say so porsche is already a good car they could do what we do but we are more flexible we concentrate on a small niche group of customers
70066 i wont say we make it better we make it different
70067 you can do a 100 000 euro modification up to 400 000 euro modification

70070 es ist nicht so als ob wir das schon wissen aber noch nicht dar ber reden es ist um es nochmal zu sagen when its fun and when its done
70071 wir hatten john riccitiello von ea da und er machte allerlei triftige kommentare ber das spiel verglich es mit anderen dingen leveldesignsachen und es war schon recht interessant zu sehen dass sich ein gesch ftsf hrer auf seinem niveau gedanken ber all diese kleinen details bei einem spiel macht
70072 wir haben immer gesagt dass es in diesem jahr erscheinen wird ich kann ihnen sagen dass es nicht im quartal vom juli bis zum september kommen wird
70073 in nevada theres absolutely enough to have an effect on the election
70074 i think that you will see not just libertarians who always vote for the libertarian candidate but conservative republicans saying weve had it weve had enough and theyre going to go ahead and vote libertarian
70075 blackwater started a private intelligence company a private cia essentially called total intelligence solutions and the man running total intelligence solutions is j cofer black hes a thirty year veteran of the central intelligence agency he also was the guy who ran the cias extraordinary rendition program the government sanctioned kidnap and torture program his thirty year cia career his network of contacts his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the united states government is now on the open market for hire
70076 i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do this
70077 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
70078 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
70079 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
70080 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
70081 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
70082 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
70083 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
70084 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
70085 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
70086 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
70087 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
70088 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
70089 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
70090 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
70091 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
70092 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
70093 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
70094 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
70095 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
70096 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
70097 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
70098 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
70099 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
70100 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
70101 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
70102 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
70103 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
70104 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
70105 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
70106 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
70107 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
70108 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
70109 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
70110 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
70111 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
70112 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
70113 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
70114 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
70115 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
70116 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
70117 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
70118 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
70119 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
70120 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
70121 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
70122 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
70123 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
70124 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
70125 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
70126 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
70127 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
70128 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
70129 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
70130 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
70131 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
70132 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
70133 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
70134 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
70135 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
70136 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
70137 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
70138 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
70139 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
70140 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
70141 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
70142 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
70143 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
70144 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
70145 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
70146 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
70147 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
70148 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
70149 who are open to doing something on the production side
70150 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
70151 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
70152 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
70153 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
70154 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
70155 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
70156 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
70157 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
70158 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
70159 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
70160 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
70161 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
70162 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
70163 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
70164 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
70165 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

70172 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
70173 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
70174 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company

70244 progress is being made toward that end but i dont have anything definitive to stand here before you today and relay
70245 if we were to commit these resources to afghanistan now we would be hamstrung in responding to future threats
70246 the situation is not so desperately urgent at this point that it requires us rushing the strategic reserve for central command into afghanistan at this very moment
70247 it is an ongoing problem that needs to be addressed
70248 we are very encouraging of the pakistani government to do as much as they possibly can to diminish the threat posed by terrorists who are operating rather freely
70249 if you look at the situation of the past several weeks indeed months there has been an uptick in pakistani military operations within the border area
70250 is it enough is it enough to stem the flow of foreign fighters that continue to traverse the border into afghanistan obviously not and therefore we have called on them to do even more
70251 they seem to believe that negotiation with tribal leaders in the federally administered tribal areas and elsewhere is worthwhile
70252 we have said from this podium and elsewhere that that is an option that is worth pursuing provided that these deals are enforceable and that there is a constant military presence within the fata going after terrorists so that no safe havens can develop there
70253 but obviously we would like for the pakistanis to be as aggressive as they can be
70254 microsoft has an open intellectual property licensing policy but in situations such as this in which a reasonable licensing agreement cannot be reached despite our best efforts we have no choice but to pursue legal action to protect our innovations
70255 primaxs practice of using our innovations without taking a patent license is unfair to the many companies that have already licensed our technology so we are taking action to protect both our partners and our innovations
70256 the trend is to access more and more applications in the cloud not call them locally
70257 thats forcing a lot of consumers who dont necessarily want to go with vista to reconsider their overall computing strategy

70268 how truthful 0 on a scale from 0 misleading to 10 truthful the mccain ads claim that obama says hell raise taxes on electricity is based on an interview obama gave to a san antonio newspaper in february in which he said what we ought to tax is a dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas according to the obama campaign what obama was referring to in the interview was his proposal for a cap and trade mechanism that would set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions allowing entities to buy and sell rights to emit if that is the case mccain is criticizing obama for a proposal that he too supports

70296 big companies like boeing are very serious about going forward with as much commonization and standardization solution sets across as many products and programs as soon as they can
70297 they need to bite the bullet now with significant migration issues rather than continue to go forward with all the disparate systems for every airplane out there
70298 we probably had about three weeks to sort of just hang out together and get to know each other and we definitely just got along right away
70299 like gugino said we have a lot of similarities in our lives and in our families that sort of brought us even closer so we could relate these characters to things that have happened in our lives and sharing those with each other so that we knew when we were doing our scenes where that was coming from
70300 when zack first said i would love to talk to you about playing this character i thought well this sounds amazing but in the graphic novel especially theres so much more of sally jupiter as an older woman than there is in her youth
70301 we have the flashback to the rape and a couple of other brief moments but not much else so i thought thats interesting i would think hed want a much older actress and ultimately in a way sort of showing the passage of time and how we come from the 40s to the 80s he ended up adding in a lot more images of her as a young woman i think you need to see sally jupiter shine in her own right so that you can understand why she tries to impose that on laurie
70302 i was in full prosthetics when we were doing this
70303 it was a really natural sort of connection for us in our lives
70304 i had to go through sensitivity training for my job at a small magazine publisher and during the training our trainer told a story about hazing in the firefighting community
70305 i was fascinated by the idea and came back to my workstation to e mail danielle about it what if there was an elite task force that got out of hand and had to be given sensitivity training i asked to which danielle replied what if they flew dragons the rest of the book grew out of that initial concept
70306 as the two try to one up each other in innovative warfare volstov creates the ultimate weapon mechanical dragons fueled with liquid magic forcing the ke han to retaliate with their own last resort
70307 we had to conduct the entire process over instant messages and e mails
70308 we were also writing on separate coasts in separate time zones so while that distance was an obstacle we learned to exploit each others waking hours to the fullest
70309 a lot of the time danielle would write while i was asleep and vice versa danielle would write about five to 10 pages send them off to me i would proofread those pages add five to 10 and send it back to her the writing had a snowballing effect and wed always have a new part to look forward to in the morning or when we got back from work or school
70310 i didnt have anything to do with the two hour telefilm
70311 i was brought in after the movie to create the series but what i found was that fans missed certain things like the turbo boost and the interaction between mike played by justin bruening and k i t t voiced by val kilmer
70312 i went back and watched the original series the first season and asked whats the mythology where are we going and how do we create this 25 years later its been all about taking the concept to the next level
70313 we live in a world where two wars are going on and there is terrorism its not as simple as it was in the early 80s when you just go and get the drug dealer down the street there is a much larger threat out there
70314 i think the biggest thing was embracing technology and owning it and making our own
70315 we realize it is an iconic show and that david hasselhoff is an iconic person but we couldnt redo the same thing over again i dont think the other half of the audience would stand for it and theres a whole new generation who has never seen it at the knight rider comic con panel we were in the room when the car transformed and the kids went crazy i think we are doing the right thing
70316 we shot in prague for four months its got everything its got submaries helicopters planes hummers bikes jet skis you name it weve got it in there nature didnt help we needed snow and didnt get it so it was a rough shoot
70317 its one of those movies whereby the interaction of the characters needed to evolve within the script while we were filming
70318 thats never easy to accomplish but somehow with vin and melanie thierry and myself we had an incredible chemistry sparked off by the madness of mathieu kassovitz
70319 religion war everything is taken over and people have lost humanity and hope
70320 and there is this mercenary diesel who has been hiding in the lost world in europe because its war torn and ravaged he tries to get home to america and hes in conflict because theres no way he could get back until someone presented him with this option deliver this package and we will give you safe passage home
70321 these two women have been living out in the remote mountains to get away from all the chaos thats been happening
70322 and as the three of them journey back to america they discover that people are chasing after them so its a journey full of danger hazard and theyre trying to kidnap the girl as well is she a weapon of destruction the hope to our future this is something we have to protect we have to make sure our girl goes into the hands of the right people
70323 a little bit of pressure i had looked at what we could do and the movie does not revolve around wire fu there is some wire work but i didnt want crouching tiger i didnt want them running up walls and flying and all of that or house of flying daggers i wanted there to be gravity that gravity was always a factor and even though we would stretch reality a little bit whatever goes up must come down as we know it
70324 i was thinking of what kind of fight they could have and i came to swords because i believe that in a sense it leveled the playing field between a man and a woman because the weapon itself is partly an equalizer
70325 so i said to jet and michelle this thing is going to be like a dance and im going to shoot it a certain kind of way where i have ability to change the time sequence so moments theyll be very extended or very compressed and itll go between reality and fantasy and therell be a certain amount of wire work anyway that was my approach that it was ballet in the middle of a battle that was raging around them this fantasy battle and that it would highlight both actors gracefulness as opposed to their brutality because it is a man versus a woman and when you get to ballet a pas de deux with swords which was my concept you kind of equal the playing field enough to say its a battle
70326 after in post is when i realized that i had had her swing right close to jets head in the one moment she might have won
70327 and it was later that i went you know what would be fun if we digitally extended his hair his ponytail and she cut it that was like an afterthought
70328 where do you start explaining when a mans words show there isnt anything he understands about subject instead is loaded with preconceptions that dont fit facts and doesnt even know he has
70329 caffeine employs the same effects whatever that means as alcohol lsd cocaine crystal methamphetamine nicotine opioids benzodiazepines and other major drugs this makes caffeine the widest used psychoactive drug in the world
70330 where as sic all other drugs have a social stigma attached to them caffeine products from chocolate to coffee are widely accepted by the general public
70331 caffeine in other words alters the nervous system in just the right way to make a person a migrainer no wonder therefore that exposure to caffeine can be followed by a withdrawal syndrome indistinguishable from a migraine episode

70351 we have needs and we have some deficencies that need to be addressed but there isnt anything out there that is unsafe on the state system
70352 if theres anything determined to be of concern those bridges are either posted for a limited live load or closed to traffic until they can be addressed
70353 part of the preliminary engineering analysis as a matter of standard practice now will include a re analysis of the gusset plate joints just to ensure they are adequate to handle the loads for the new repair project
70354 i think everyone can feel confident that if the bridge is open to traffic its safe to travel on
70355 coaches are shuffling round and round and its kind of nice to have some comfort in the system
70356 so its only going to benefit us no pressure at all
70357 theres so much more involved than just xs and os
70358 i mean you got to know guys personalities and how theyre going to play on the field and now that we kind of all understand each others roles and stuff i think its not only going to benefit the linebackers but the whole defense
70359 anytime you have a position like we are where a lot of communication goes on a lot of change and responsibility with motions and stuff its great to have the same set of guys and i think we have a great group here
70360 when you send a blitz you want to know the linebackers are going to get there
70361 and so you know theyre a great unit the consistency of them theyve been playing for a few years so theyve got the feel for it and thats the kind of consistency we want up front

70378 those whose rights have been restored have served their time and paid their debt to society
70379 the primary goal of the corrections system is to rehabilitate those who have committed crimes and return them as contributing members to society
70380 in my mind i never believed those would be the types of people who would be given serious consideration
70381 i would think the person who fell victim to these offenders would expect they would continue to be treated as the violent offenders that they are
70382 those whose rights have been restored have served their time and paid their debt to society

70413 the methodist church by bullying lorine tevi and sereana qoro have in fact abused the rights of these women to freedom of opinion and also freedom of religion and belief
70414 the fact that methodist men in influential positions such as interim minister filipe bole have not been subjected to similar bully tactics means that they are actually being discriminated against because they are women
70415 the church has no right to force its members to support one particular political party or particular political ideology by doing this the methodist church of fiji is violating the rights of freedom of religion and belief

70417 were not just addicted to cheap oil as tom friedman and al gore have eloquently argued theres a deeper economic truth at work here its not just cheap oil were addicted to its cheap everything and the world were entering isnt really of peak oil as it is one of peak consumption lets re examine the house of cards that is the global financial system emerging markets seek export led growth they undervalue their currencies so their exports are more competitive purely in terms of price thats essentially a subsidy to consumers on the other side of the table those in the developed world as emerging markets accumulate surpluses they recycle them they lend them back to the us and uk in the form of government and mortgage debt stabilizing their economies and amplifying the existing consumption subsidy through leverage
70418 at the heart of next generation advantage is paradoxically being able to break yesterdays maladaptive consumption addiction not fuel it it is firms who can shift past nihilistic meaningless industrial era corporate purpose beyond acting as mere pushers of an addiction who will power the next global financial system
70419 green marketing expert jacquie ottman recently gave an eye opening talk about green marketing today at sustainable brands 08 she suggested that companies could start encouraging sustainable consumption perhaps she said companies could pitch buying less of something the big ad campaigns combined with real world environmental pressures will prompt many consumers to ask for something very different from the companies they buy from innovative companies will answer the call and happily eat their competitors lunch

70427 i raised this question even before euro 2008 my only wish is to play in a stronger club if zenit agrees with chelsea or arsenal i will gladly join either of them the failure of the transfer to barcelona has upset me but i am trying to be philosophical
70428 i am perfectly aware of zenits position the offer 12m was really too small it is strange that my good playing at euro 2008 should have hurt my chances my price jumped and my dream will perhaps remain a dream

70458 we are fast approaching a solar eclipse it takes place on august 1 but already the moon and earth are slowly moving into alignment with each other and with the sun the astronomy of an eclipse is fascinating the astrology is even more gripping mystics believe that an invisible cosmic portal opens up allowing communication with other realms some say aliens find it easier to visit us some say we get into psychic contact with our ancestors and some just say we are more likely to get a little giddy so really this is best thought of as a week when anything is possible make sure your anything is a positive thing
70459 in some parts of the world todays solar eclipse will be a stunning sight in others we may notice a slight darkening of the sky astrologers have long known that it is possible to capture the energy of an eclipse visible or not that is why many people choose such times for special ceremonies or to launch important plans i am at the big chill festival in the uk working with astrologers to reveal this eclipses full meaning on sunday i will host a symposium on the subject

70494 later this year gen david petraeus will present me his recommendations on future troop levels including further reductions in our combat forces as conditions permit
70495 a significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the troop surge
70496 another is the increasing capability of the iraqi forces iraqi forces now have 192 combat battalions in the fight and more than 110 of these battalions are taking the lead in combat operations against terrorists and extremists
70497 the purpose of the surge has not been fulfilled if you put tens of thousands more troops into a region will it bring more safety especially with the excellence of our men and women in uniform yes but why was that done to create reconciliation that hasnt happened

70546 bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives
70547 we have nothing to learn from education systems in third world countries
70548 you finally agreed to stop being a control freak and let me drive so i figured hey i can do something bizarre and out of character too
70549 no of course not you just always want an escape route
70550 is it destined that no mans girlfriend and mother can ever get along
70551 you had no innocence when i got there you were defective goods and i shouldve returned you
70552 well shit thierry you already threw my tag out now youre screwed
70553 i dont think they allow the sale of people anymore
70554 is that your gun or are you just happy to see me
70555 lets go back to my place i have it all to myself
70556 the pay for cops is shit i think i deserve a reward for my selflessness
70557 i told daniel id watch a movie with him when i got back
70558 of daniel this hypothetical other man is he a self esteem less idiot
70559 thierry how much of an ass do you think i am
70560 didnt find anyone else as awesome as me or did you just pine away dateless and alone
70561 cant be love if im not being insulted right can it
70562 thierry let me handle this it could be a burglar
70563 daniel get in my car its unlocked lock it when you get in dont unlock it until we come out
70564 thierry we need to move now that thing could come back
70565 i notice your spending more time on writing your words
70566 thats a interesting drawing what image cam to mind when you created it
70567 how come you decided to intersect the lines or draw circles here
70568 gosh that could have some side effects i hope the tests get better because if they are gonna ban performance enhancing drugs then they should have a way of enforcing that and regular joes using it too gee you must be desperate when you start buying drugs online with no way of ensuring you are getting what you paid for
70569 uh you could get the same effect through high altitude training

70572 oh you dont mind if i get that with my pelvic toner do you until i get eight robot arms im using the toner as a kind of extra hand so do you want this shirt back now no i can keep it
70573 could make it easier for health care institutions and individuals to deny contraceptive services to women who need them
70574 the regulation is so overly broad in scope that it could undermine state laws that seek to ensure the availability of these services even those laws that protect survivors of rape and sexual assault
70575 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
70576 is really out of the mainstream from how minnesota women think about birth control and how minnesotans think of emergency contraception
70577 we must protect barrier free access to emergency contraception so that a survivor may be able to give up that particular fear as she weighs the other post rape fears while many may argue the various aspects of the language of dhhs proposed rules we want to stand firm and say that victims survivors of sexual assault should not be pawns in this debate
70578 this proposed regulation is of particular concern to us because women who need contraception may be unable to access it and that would of course lead to unintended pregnancies for instance this regulation would almost certainly negate the benefits of our states law that guarantees that survivors of rape and sexual assault have information about and access to emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms
70579 this proposed regulation will not only lead to unintended pregnancies but will contravene the laws of our state we urge you now to ask the bush administration not to advance this flawed and unnecessary public policy
70580 last year legislators on both sides of the debate over reproductive rights united behind a measure that provides rape survivors with the emergency contraception that could help prevent a pregnancy after a violent attack
70581 gov pawlenty recognized the strong public support behind this common sense measure and signed it into law now just one year after the law took effect we are urging him to call on the bush administration to stop an attack on birth control that would undermine this state law
70582 these two domains in particular we didnt think about 15 years ago u s strategic command has the mission of defending deterring and dissuading and if called on to fight dominate and win in these domains
70583 how to start and operate your own pro life outreach crisis pregnancy center
70584 we are a pregnancy testing center what is pro life
70585 these two domains in particular we didnt think about 15 years ago u s strategic command has the mission of defending deterring and dissuading and if called on to fight dominate and win in these domains

70587 this very night you will all fall away on account of me for it is written
70588 therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship do not conform any longer to the patter of the world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
70589 one might describe the physical features of the island as a treeless area rising abruptly from a massive stone wall encompassing the whole region against this volcanic heap the waves of the aegean dash themselves continually
70590 each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
70591 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you give a tenth of your spices mint dill and cumin but you have neglected the more important matters of the law justice mercy and faithfulness you should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former
70592 on the first day of every week each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income saving it up so that when i come no collections will have to be made

70602 in everything therefore treat others in the same way as you want them to treat you
70603 it is not good for man to be alone i will make him a helper suitable for him
70604 if man was head woman was the crown she is crown to her husband and to the visible creation man is dust refined woman is dust double refined once removed further from the earth
70605 the personality and background of the husband not the wife were the important factors in the success of a marriage
70606 studies of delinquency repeatedly indicate that fathers are more influential than mothers in the development of delinquent behavior in their children
70607 if the father attends church regularly the children will be more likely to attend regularly regardless of the mothers attendance record
70608 fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord
70609 that was terrible what a bunch of clods never again
70610 some of what i give will be used to serve the needy am i giving enough
70611 how good it is to be here and share in the experience of the presence of god
70612 jesus always used stories and illustrations like these when speaking to the crowds in fact he never spoke to them without using such parables
70613 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven
70614 but just as he who called you is holy so be holy in all you do for it is written be holy because i am holy
70615 if jesus is real then why dont his people live differently
70616 we find there is very little difference in ethical behavior between churchgoers and those who are not active religiously
70617 blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
70618 my food said jesus is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work
70619 because you were slain and with your blood you purchased men for god from every tribe and language and people and nation you have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our god
70620 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work
70621 i can do all things through christ who gives me strength
70622 remain in me and i will remain in you no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me
70623 i tried that before and failed theres no point in trying again
70624 ok we got married 20 years ago oh what is your name thats doctrines thats detail no need to charge my memory with such things i love you thats all that matter and when is our anniversary
70625 you already know this you already know that i dont need to tell you about this and i dont need to tell you about that
70626 but i do not want you to be ignorant brethren concerning those who have fallen asleep and how he is underlining this
70627 and jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with god and man
70628 we are not home here we are strangers and pilgrims here
70629 fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the lord
70630 fathers do not exasperate your children so that they do not lose heart
70631 keep sailing peter well land at another port where they cant find us
70632 when jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd
70633 des we need a cleanup in the sleeping quarters mother fuckers were at it again
70634 you should really think before killing people off goat or you wont get any information

70644 el chaparr n de malas noticias econ micas est poniendo en evidencia al gobierno que se empe en evitar la palabra crisis para no afrontar la cruda situaci n que ha errado en casi todas sus predicciones y que no ha sabido reaccionar ni encontrar verdaderas soluciones
70645 la magnitud de los acontecimientos y la perspectiva del tiempo permiten ver ahora con claridad lo que ya adelantamos en su d a la peque ez de iniciativas como la desgravaci n fiscal de 400 euros las ltimas medidas del ministerio de industria para ahorrar energ a s lo es m s de lo mismo

70655 aqu y ahora lo que es grave como circunstancia a adida a una crisis que nos dejar canijos y parados es que el sistema fomenta la fuga vacacional de quienes debieran trabajar sin descanso para resolverla

70659 tras el anuncio de fusi n de iberia y british airways el acuerdo por el que gas natural comprar el 45 de uni n fenosa a acs es la prueba de que frente a la crisis y ante la inacci n del gobierno el mercado toma sus decisiones
70660 con este pacto empresarial concluye un periodo de incertidumbre en el tablero energ tico nacional
70661 algunos expertos han interpretado la operaci n como la soluci n espa ola a los retos del sector
70662 que un grupo de ejecutivos se ha llenado el bolsillo con un golpe de mano
70663 en las dos intentonas fallidas de gas natural por hacerse con iberdrola y con endesa la gasista recibi numerosas cr ticas que la acusaban de ser ella la que realmente necesitaba ganar tama o
70664 para gas natural era la ltima oportunidad de hacer una operaci n espa ola
70665 en esta ocasi n las cosas se han hecho mejor por la v a del pacto empresarial y sin ruido
70666 hay que celebrar el positivo acuerdo alcanzado ayer por gas natural para comprar uni n fenosa a la constructora acs en primer lugar porque esta operaci n evita que la tercera compa a el ctrica del pa s caiga en manos extranjeras
70667 para gas natural la compra de uni n fenosa supondr la culminaci n de su estrategia
70668 en este caso se cumple el dicho de que a la tercera va la vencida en la presente ocasi n todo ha ido bien

70714 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition

70742 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath

70744 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
70745 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
70746 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
70747 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
70748 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
70749 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible

70788 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
70789 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
70790 we consider cloud computing to be the model that can fundamentally change the current it market structure and create paradigm shifts
70791 to spread cloud computing in japan it is very meaningful that ibm has launched the first cloud computing center in japan at this time ns solutions research center will actively use this center and advocate cloud computing
70792 to develop high skilled human resources in the it field it is necessary to create the latest it environment for the education space
70793 kyushu university is very interested in cloud computing technology which can provide an on demand it environment to our students and teachers we have been working with ibm the pioneer of this field kyushu university will continue to take advantage of cloud computing technology more actively
70794 this announcement further demonstrates ibms commitment to our state and to our people
70795 i look forward to maintaining this partnership with ibm for years to come
70796 this new data center in north carolina is part of ibms commitment to construct the worlds most advanced data centers
70797 this is the latest example of ibms deep history of innovation in north carolina when we open for business in late 2009 the ibm data center in research triangle park will be a strategic location for our outsourcing business for years to come id like to thank the state of north carolina durham county and duke energy for their outstanding support that helped make this project possible

70803 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
70804 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
70805 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
70806 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

70812 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
70813 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
70814 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
70815 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority

70817 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy

70821 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

70823 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
70824 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
70825 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
70826 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
70827 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
70828 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
70829 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
70830 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
70831 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
70832 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
70833 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
70834 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
70835 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
70836 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
70837 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
70838 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
70839 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

70841 the story of a low rent super villain the hero who keeps beating him up and the cute girl from the laundromat hes too shy to talk to
70842 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
70843 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
70844 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
70845 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
70846 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
70847 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
70848 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
70849 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
70850 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
70851 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

70858 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
70859 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
70860 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
70861 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
70862 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
70863 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
70864 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
70865 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
70866 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
70867 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
70868 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
70869 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
70870 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
70871 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
70872 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
70873 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
70874 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
70875 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
70876 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
70877 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
70878 as gera es futuras poder o se perguntar em que os nossos pais estavam pensando por que n o acordaram quando tinham chance
70879 the proxy fight is over and it will not do shareholders or yahoo any good to have the annual meeting turn into a media event for no purpose
70880 i believe both gentlemen genuinely wish that we will be able to work together to enhance value
70881 in recent years we have witnessed the benefit that a web site like wikipedia can have on all knowledge
70882 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
70883 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
70884 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
70885 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
70886 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
70887 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
70888 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
70889 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
70890 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
70891 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
70892 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
70893 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
70894 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
70895 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
70896 pullman area guardsmen prepare for deployment local support group starting to ramp up efforts as well
70897 i think well try to organize something for all people in the community so we can all get together and pack packages or write letters and kind of make a party out of it
70898 we need to let the troops know that even though theyre gone theyre not absent from our minds its a way to show our appreciation and let them know were thinking about them
70899 its just a way of keeping in touch and handling things
70900 we set it up to do it back in june so wed know theyd be there and it didnt take away from family time before they left
70901 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
70902 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
70903 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
70904 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
70905 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
70906 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
70907 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
70908 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
70909 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
70910 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
70911 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
70912 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
70913 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
70914 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
70915 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
70916 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
70917 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
70918 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
70919 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
70920 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
70921 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
70922 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
70923 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
70924 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
70925 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
70926 how the women of the media sell unhappiness and liberalism to the women of america
70927 the music industry is a business like any other but at the helm of this industry is a pool of artists whose work often serves as a barometer to the social and environmental challenges our society faces
70928 its a bit patronizing for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
70929 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
70930 ill be the first to admit that the music industry has some big unavoidable emissions associated with their business
70931 with upward of 60 vehicles getting seven miles per gallon for a single national tour the impact can be pretty staggering
70932 a majority of pollution and waste associated with music tours is actually an effect of the fans themselves driving to and from shows producing waste at the shows littering in parking lots and venues using one use plastic containers for all their food and drink etc
70933 thats a no brainer of course its a violation of international law thats why its a covert action the guy is a terrorist go grab his ass
70934 in 10 to 12 years we will reach the tipping point
70935 you know life shouldnt be hard its all about connecting and finding a reason for it
70936 how many times has she gotten me involved in things even when ive said no im not doing it
70937 its just something about jaki she has a way of talking people into doing things without them even realizing it
70938 you cant help but get sucked in shes so approachable
70939 my business is my life and im ok with that
70940 i think she would love to have a significant other an equal whos really the key person in her life
70941 she needs someone to share it with because shes accumulated so much and i dont just mean wealth
70942 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
70943 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
70944 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
70945 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
70946 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
70947 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
70948 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
70949 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
70950 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
70951 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
70952 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
70953 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
70954 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
70955 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
70956 in america you are not playing the race card when you acknowledge a very visible fact trollneequa commented on
70957 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
70958 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
70959 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
70960 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
70961 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
70962 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
70963 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
70964 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
70965 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
70966 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
70967 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
70968 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
70969 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
70970 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
70971 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
70972 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes
70973 kerry won every gore county in ohio except clark nowhere among the gore counties did more votes move from the blue to the red column than in clark
70974 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
70975 hes the only naked man that will ever be in my bedroom
70976 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
70977 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
70978 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
70979 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
70980 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
70981 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
70982 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
70983 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
70984 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
70985 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
70986 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
70987 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
70988 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
70989 you know its not about you its about your country
70990 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
70991 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
70992 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
70993 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
70994 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
70995 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
70996 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
70997 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
70998 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
70999 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
71000 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
71001 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
71002 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
71003 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
71004 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
71005 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
71006 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
71007 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
71008 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
71009 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
71010 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
71011 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
71012 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
71013 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
71014 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
71015 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
71016 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
71017 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
71018 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
71019 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
71020 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
71021 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
71022 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
71023 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
71024 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
71025 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
71026 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
71027 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
71028 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
71029 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
71030 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
71031 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
71032 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
71033 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
71034 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
71035 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
71036 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
71037 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
71038 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
71039 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
71040 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
71041 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
71042 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
71043 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
71044 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
71045 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
71046 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
71047 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
71048 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
71049 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
71050 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
71051 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
71052 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
71053 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
71054 the best use of talents and experience i have gained in my life is to expand the political space in which these members and politicians address the climate crisis
71055 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
71056 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
71057 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
71058 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
71059 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
71060 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
71061 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
71062 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
71063 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
71064 if the vice president says its do able i believe
71065 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
71066 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
71067 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
71068 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
71069 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
71070 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
71071 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
71072 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
71073 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
71074 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
71075 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
71076 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
71077 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
71078 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
71079 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
71080 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
71081 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
71082 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
71083 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
71084 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
71085 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
71086 two canaries in the coal mine the first one is in the arctic of course the arctic ocean has a floating ice cap greenland on its side there i say canary in the coal mine because the arctic is one part of the world that is experiencing faster impact from global warming this is the largest ice shelf in the arctic the ward hunt ice shelf it just cracked in half a year ago the scientists were astonished
71087 current coastal temperatures are about 1 c below their 1940 values
71088 at the summit of the greenland ice sheet the summer average temperature has decreased at the rate of 2 2 c per decade since the beginning of the measurements in 1987
71089 colors indicate ice sheet elevation change rate in cm year from satellite altimeter data 1992 2003 the spatially averaged increase is 5 4 0 2 cm year
71090 shut off would imply repeal of the law of conservation of angular momentum widely disseminated and grossly oversimplified pictures showing the ocean as a conveyor belt have misled people into thinking ocean circulation is driven by a sinking motion at high latitudes
71091 temperature records show that the arctic was in fact warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than it is today
71092 2007 winter sea ice extent at both poles reached record highs
71093 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
71094 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
71095 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
71096 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
71097 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
71098 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
71099 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
71100 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
71101 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
71102 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
71103 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
71104 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
71105 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
71106 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
71107 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
71108 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
71109 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
71110 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
71111 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
71112 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
71113 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
71114 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

71119 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
71120 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
71121 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
71122 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
71123 when our children assess what we and our generation did here in this world as they look backward they will ask one of two questions theyll look back and either they will ask what were you thinking didnt you see the glaciers melting didnt you see the deserts growing and the droughts worsening and the crops drying up didnt you see the sea level rising didnt you see the floods didnt you pay attention to what was going on didnt you care what were you thinking
71124 one which i would much prefer them to ask i want them to look back on this time and ask how did you find the moral courage to successfully address the crisis that so many said was impossible to address and when they ask that question i want you to tell them that you saw it as a privilege

71135 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
71136 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
71137 i felt a little flat in the beginning and left some pitches in the middle of the plate it got better as the game went along i made some adjustments and we were able to fight back that was a great win for us
71138 were playing good were playing the way we should be playing
71139 were playing aggressive guys are running were putting guys in motion guys looking to take the extra bag thats the way we have to play thats the way were going to be successful
71140 cha seung can get away with some pitches up but theyve got to be above the strike zone hes got to stay down and elevate when he wants to i think some balls were intended to be down he just didnt get them down
71141 he might not have been totally on top of his game he sort of got it together in the middle innings and showed why hes the pitcher that he is
71142 weve got to do a better job and weve got to play better defense myself included
71143 the defense got away from us a little bit in that inning and that can come back and bite you in the rear

71183 the other party launched a dirty campaign against us because they know we are going to win but everything they say is lies
71184 your hands shouldnt quiver to vote for the iron fist
71185 the other party launched a dirty campaign against us because they know we are going to win but everything they say is lies

71192 when the judges are not professional and political considerations lead to their appointments well you can await whatever decision
71193 a lot of these institutions have been promoting the increase in their black populations but clearly this increase reflects a growth in their black immigrant populations
71194 in part it has to do with coming from a country especially those educated in caribbean and african countries where blacks were in the majority and did not experience the stigma that black children did in the united states
71195 the fathers of these students tend to be much better educated this is not just true of immigrants from africa and the caribbean this is true across the board we have an admissions system that prefers wealth that rewards wealth and calls it merit
71196 we do not focus specifically on whether students are caribbean american african american or african we do not involve ourselves with exact roots
71197 we try to find students from all walks of life including african american students who have their roots in the southeastern united states
71198 i felt disappointed and sad that we were caught in the middle of a political discussion that was not with us
71199 people are saying i may lose my job or somebody else is going to get my job because of free trade and whats very important for people like me who believe in markets is one to explain the economic benefits but also to assure people that theres trade adjustment programs to help people retrain for better jobs

71205 honduras today survives on remittances but mass migration also causes enormous damage
71206 those who manage to reach the u s can lift their families a little out of poverty but often the families fall apart and the kids end up in gangs or on drugs we need to create the conditions so people dont need to leave instead of thinking of migration as something to admire
71207 i havent even thought what im going to name her

71221 today some people are honoring him but not most of the people the people remember
71222 voting no is like closing the door on the canal its the top source of income for panama and improving it means more money for the government and less poverty
71223 the expansion is necessary but we all have to watch closely make sure there isnt embezzlement and corruption
71224 with that kind of money theres a lot to steal
71225 generally i believe most people say that this turnout is a bit lower than they had seen before in general elections
71226 we had to lay down extra mattresses across every bit of floor space

71232 the goal is not to strand travelers its to advise them of the change
71233 if for whatever reason they havent heard of it we have emergency mechanisms to deal with the situation we will work with them with whatever documentation they present to try and verify the information we need
71234 im afraid if its not properly implemented and communicated that whti could have a serious negative impact on legitimate commerce and tourism as well as our diplomatic relationships with our two largest trading partners canada and mexico

71270 i became passionate with the story because it was so local i brought it into the classroom and had a blast explaining to my students how this ice age mammal was found 15 minutes away so they thought that was cool
71271 then the great find happened here in 2005 and brought back the same excitement
71272 every student in anns class for the past 10 years just hangs on every word she says
71273 thats just her ability to relate to the students so whenever we have an exciting project with the forest preserve i know her class will be interested because ann is interested
71274 there are so many wetlands throughout the county and state and they are all candidates to have housed mastodons and mammoths

71293 we are saddened to have to take this step these are all good employees but unfortunately given the loss in revenues we have no option but to cut back on operating costs
71294 our first concern in any situation like this is of the employees and i have discussed what happened today with sea life park and their announcement of the employee lay offs

71335 created a flat world a global web enabled platform for multiple forms of sharing knowledge and work irrespective of time distance geography and increasingly language
71336 obviously the first thing we thought about was were not going to bring this kid up for one start and hurt his chances of playing on the olympic team and putting the olympic team in any kind of jeopardy
71337 and we said if this is going to be one start then we wouldnt bring the kid up
71338 i think thats an unfair shot at us saying we did something that was against the canadian olympic team
71339 we have great respect with what they do and we have a great relationship with them
71340 people want ubiquitous cell service on their wireless phones everywhere they go and that includes their home and offices
71341 the airave makes it even easier to get enhanced coverage no matter where you live or work
71342 since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
71343 that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony
71344 the companys relentless focus on and ability to meet demand within emerging markets helped propel shipment volumes forward
71345 quite frankly were telling them we need construction done sooner rather than later
71346 its going to cost considerable dollars to replace that bridge
71347 nos vamos satisfechos porque tuvimos la primera reuni n de este consejo directivo y la recepci n donde se plantearon todos estos temas fue satisfactoria pero tambi n por supuesto se dej en claro que el estado no tiene recursos infinitos para satisfacer ma ana todas las necesidades
71348 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
71349 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
71350 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989
71351 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out
71352 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
71353 our nation has a unique place in the world we are the greatest force for good on earth we chart historys course yes we must be involved in the destiny of other nations
71354 history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
71355 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
71356 its something that im definitely going to reflect on now and then when im done
71357 i continue to stay healthy and im surrounded by good talent and good things are going to come from that so as long as i can stay healthy and these guys do their job around me were going to do some special things here in montreal
71358 it was a huge play obviously to be able to start fast but to my recollection the last three games i think weve started fast in the third quarter
71359 i just wanted them to forget about the first half and move on like it didnt happen the game was 0 0 and just go play and they handled it very well and they finished the game
71360 richie did what he can do we had too many penalties i dont know what the total was but weve been doing good the last time we lost the penalty ratio was the first game against montreal and the rest of the games weve been plus
71361 any game you can come in and go 5 for 5 its definitely a good feeling especially two of them being 50 and 51
71362 i dont know if its a high ankle sprain or not but it is a sprained ankle and obviously he wasnt able to come back in this game so well have to see how he responds over the weekend to treatment and weve got a full week to get ready for the next one so hopefully i know hell do everything he can to get back
71363 the system is broken people dont have confidence in the process and they feel they arent being treated fairly
71364 when there are instances of death or serious injury suffered by a civilian at the hands of the police there has to be an independent investigation
71365 the opcc has no role in the investigation no ability to change the investigation or the decision made by the police department it has oversight and can act if there is something obviously biased in the process and call a public hearing
71366 but these are expensive and take a long time and are only used in the most serious of complaints
71367 i agree with their frustrations we are endeavouring to operate with a police act that needs some work but a boycott isnt the answer
71368 we share many of their concerns and we have been advocating reform of the police act since 2003
71369 in 2005 we issued an annual report asking for all kinds of changes
71370 does not share their view on having incidents involving the police investigated by civilians
71371 this position was taken by former court of appeal justice josiah wood who did an extensive review of the police act in 2007 and found the police should still investigate themselves but the opcc needed enhanced powers of oversight
71372 most of these relate to police misconduct and in the past wed refer them to the opcc
71373 there have been monetary settlements and we feel that when a judge makes a ruling and its public then the police department will take the incidents a lot more seriously and dish out more appropriate punishment to the officers
71374 our sales on wednesday were double what they normally are
71375 especially for the dairy and bread ive never seen anything like it
71376 im lucky because i have friends to stay with but my lifes on hold
71377 weve had customers who just came up to shop for the day and theyve had to get hotels
71378 we still have internet access although i only have 20 minutes left on my battery
71379 anyone that was here and we thought might stay is taking the long way home we still have all the food were ready for the people
71380 the irony of it is they said initially they would have it cleaned up in 24 hours
71381 they are marked and ready to go to their destinations
71382 theres no question that some neighborhoods and maybe most of manhattan is really oversaturated when it comes to chain stores
71383 clearly this does present a lot of problems for the mom and pop businesses out there
71384 wherever i go i see subways a lot of chain restaurants on every street
71385 theres no question in my mind that theres far more national chains here in the city today than five or 10 years ago
71386 part of the reason we did this is because the mom and pop business is suffering in large parts of the city
71387 maybe some of this data could be used to help spur innovative solutions
71388 when you see a dunkin donuts on every corner people are going to go to them instead of a small coffee shop its not because of the quality its because of the name
71389 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly
71390 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
71391 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic
71392 we used the mail to transmit some documents relating to adoption subsidies
71393 at this stage of the game after two years weve had conferences and conferences on this case we are supposed to be ready
71394 they blew it when they indicted him in the first place
71395 i think they went back and examined the rodriguez case
71396 im not going to expose my hand it will be clear during the trial why we sought this
71397 estamos conformes con la reuni n porque al menos se hizo fue con mucha sinceridad y franqueza me hubiese preocupado si se hubieran sacado una foto ri ndose los dos

71401 a mitad de agosto habr una reuni n de todos los que integramos este espacio y ser una convocatoria amplia desde marzo que no nos juntamos todos los que tenemos representaci n territorial
71402 insistimos en que la responsabilidad total es de la presidenta si hace se deja ayudar bienvenido sea sino lo lamentamos pero no por el gobierno sino por el pueblo argentino
71403 el tema lo tienen que arreglar la presidenta y la vicepresidenta
71404 estamos conformes con la reuni n porque al menos se hizo fue con mucha sinceridad y franqueza me hubiese preocupado si se hubieran sacado una foto ri ndose los dos

71410 then apple came along and in a 30 second commercial they just made it dead simple
71411 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world
71412 this changes what you see and how people interact socialize and communicate
71413 to me that was the standout of the whole iphone deal
71414 we believe that over the long term the subsidized iphone 3g will drive increased sales volume and revenues among high quality data centric customers
71415 the 199 price point should be a big hit with consumers
71416 this is going to bring in a whole new demographic
71417 its a no brainer that if you bring down cost more people will buy it
71418 since 2004 rappaports blog has become one of the top 20 food blogs in the nation people dont visit to hear rappaport wax poetic about a plum they come because several times each week she posts new original recipes illustrated with food porn quality photos
71419 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
71420 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
71421 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
71422 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
71423 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
71424 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
71425 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
71426 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
71427 every time you meet someone every time you come in contact with someone you send out and invisible tether from your heart to theirs and youre connected
71428 random tidbits not that i have tidbits if you catch my drift
71429 theyll fix it search is an iterative process but what the surge of interest in cuil showed is that theres a huge pent up demand for an alternative to google
71430 dr patterson joined google in 2004 and filed six patent applications
71431 now as an ex googler or xoogler she has focused on some of the weak points in the google approach to search namely
71432 were engineers and we are reading the press for good feedback and critical feedback
71433 if we didnt have improvements to make we wouldnt have a job here
71434 cuil hit google with its larger index of 120 million web pages processed to googles 30 to 40 million pages
71435 keep in mind that size doesnt matter but it is a public relations hook
71436 the surge in users monday caused slowdowns and brown outs these are normal glitches google had them cuil has them
71437 with that type of development it spurs other types of development for example hotels and motels
71438 were please to have this quality of a flag flying here a drury and a westin
71439 we dont have to build schools for our visitors they come in visit enjoy the area and then go home and leave their tax dollars behind so we definitely benefit from that city and county
71440 there are plenty of peole and things in the world that point out the things that make us different and almost none that point out the things that make us the same
71441 the creation and growth of companies in the green economy is the economic opportunity of our lifetime doug operates in all these scientific and business areas
71442 doug brings an interesting background at cargill and khosla ventures the most active clean tech investor in america
71443 piper is our largest brightest light in clean tech investment banking this can only be good for minnesota and our energy opportunities
71444 i believe the midwest has the ability to be the epicenter of the bioenergy and clean technology industry
71445 piper is a national and international firm in the alternative energy business we will encourage and stimulate early stage developments and well raise capital for later stage investments and initial public offerings
71446 everyone in this government is responsible for a string of failures we must let the people decide through new elections
71447 we are not worried by the change in israeli prime minister because we know that israel is seriously engaged to remain involved in the negotiation process with the palestinians
71448 hitched its fate to the possibility of achieving an agreement by the end of the year
71449 i will quit my duties in an honourable just and responsible manner as i have acted throughout my mandate i will then prove my innocence
71450 the olmert who spoke yesterday from the garden of his compound in jerusalem was a crushed and battered man tainted by allegations lacking public trust or a sympathetic ear
71451 we are totally embracing the historical aspect of sanlitun as an enclave were adding a more cosmopolitan touch to the area
71452 sanlitun is a very famous place in beijing its centrally located if you look at this iconic area here it really will become a very unique shopping experience
71453 if you go and stay in any of the fantastic hotels in the cbd you cant walk anywhere
71454 and it threatens to unravel the only path to success that weve had to this point
71455 think of this as a snowball going down the hill that snowballs getting mighty big
71456 are place names in some countries also words associated with a place used to identify products that come from these places and have specific characteristics
71457 that we would like to demonstrate our willingness a global willingness in these discussions that means we want geographical indications included in there
71458 its not just france we are fighting for its champagne
71459 rich 40 year history of doing well for the community
71460 but it also seems like a time when they need some new people
71461 my goal is much broader than that to help get the park district going in the right direction
71462 i think that gives me a unique perspective as to what longtime residents are looking for
71463 im also acutely aware of what new families are moving to naperville for and what they expect from the community
71464 i currently have no burning issues relative to the park district other than to see it run successfully and force some team building among board members
71465 the new web site doesnt add any new information it just organizes the information in a different way
71466 we want to try to get as much information out as possible
71467 we wanted to offer some other event fully based on the dogs
71468 we have a lot of people in the community who have dogs and a lot of people who belong to our dog park
71469 i think its important to have in the community because we do have a lot of dog lovers and its a good place to go to find out more information
71470 i think itll just be a fun and informative afternoon
71471 as well as the amount of vendors we have represented
71472 twenty years ago one half of all citizens in corpora met the standards for adequate physical fitness as then defined by the national advisory board on physical fitness today the board says that only one quarter of all citizens are adequately fit and suggests that spending too much time using computers may be the reason but since overall fitness levels are highest in regions of corpora where levels of computer ownership are also highest it is clear that using computers has not made citizens less physically fit instead as shown by this years unusually low expenditures on fitness related products and services the recent decline in the economy is most likely the cause and fitness levels will improve when the economy does
71473 since it is big in the news it would be a fun opportunity to put that in the maze
71474 he was an outgoing friendly guy who knew everyone in the community
71475 i never saw him treat anyone with anything but respect and dignity he was just a good decent guy
71476 they did building searches and tracking judge would blow in jerrys ear to wake him up when it was time to go work except that he didnt understand when it was vacation time
71477 he was that kind of guy he was concerned about the well being of his own family but that extended to his police family as well
71478 he was a guy you could go to with questions about the job
71479 he had a lot of institutional knowledge with what had done on in the department that you couldnt read in a book
71480 the primary reason for having the observatory is because of the size of our telescope which has to be permanently managed on a site
71481 the lakesky observatory would provide us with the opportunity not only to house our telescope but to further expand our public and educational outreach concerning the subject of astronomy
71482 that means we have to consider parking bathrooms security options and the overall interest of the local community in the location
71483 we are flexible building our observatory in lake county would be nice for location however it is very light polluted
71484 the typical star party would probably feature the lakesky 20 and a few other scopes pointed at interesting things in the sky
71485 to raise the funds we would need to spend a lot of time getting money through fundraisers
71486 our best bet would be getting support from corporate sponsors and contributors
71487 we will continue to actively pursue and negotiate sites for our intended observatory
71488 always the loudest always the happiest always the last to leave he never wanted these times to end
71489 he prided himself on building not just homes but neighborhoods and communities
71490 it was an expression of davids belief in our country that no city should be abandoned none of americas people should be expendable
71491 selections by my sisters and i included shopping cubs games an art museum and tour of cabrini green
71492 over nearly 40 years of leading our company david has created a team of teams ready to navigate the challenges we face today his spirit strong values and passion will guide us on this journey there could be no greater gift to david than successfully navigating through the rapids and building an even stronger company that leads our industry for the next 40 years
71493 having fun learning the more were different the more were the same
71494 diversity is just another way of say how we all contribute to one another
71495 if we can contribute in any way to the training of prosecutors that is definitely our goal
71496 the greater emphasis we place on aggressive dui prosecution the fewer lives we lose on the highways
71497 there are not going to be the fireworks that some had expected
71498 given the erratic behavior of microsoft with its constantly changing terms and scope of deal i wouldnt predict anything
71499 but there is clarity after settling the proxy contest we are getting a sense that our company is back on track
71500 yahoo and microsoft missed out on helping each other a great deal
71501 selling yahoo is fine but at the same time we are trying to negotiate a good deal for shareholders
71502 the board has to look out for what is right for the company
71503 to branch out a little bit and do things collaboratively
71504 by combining our resources were able to make more programming available
71505 beyond that i think the books are really interesting and are going to expose a lot more people to hispanic culture
71506 i hope this is an idea that takes root and grows
71507 i think this is a great idea and im delighted to participate i hope it raises awareness for people that reading is important and vital to any community
71508 weve been focusing on the english language learners program these past few years
71509 not an us and them type of education the bigger picture of it is that it brings the community together
71510 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
71511 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
71512 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
71513 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
71514 he was a personable guy he wanted to take care of the people who lived there
71515 most of it is going to be tied in one way or another to the 50th anniversary music that was popular in 1958
71516 its a great way to cool off on a hot sunday
71517 village administration is in discussions with the affected unions and theyre working on that now
71518 were seeing this countywide where employees are being laid off
71519 its terrible if it wasnt for this economy we wouldnt be having this discussion
71520 it certainly is an issue nobody wants to start with a deficit next year
71521 the issue is that retail sales tax is down so much and youre not getting developer impact fees because projects have stopped essentially
71522 it gives us more contact with southern and western states
71523 i find the timing of this to be very interesting
71524 i think it deprives me of my right and freedom of choice
71525 im really afraid that were going to have inexperienced people
71526 but we must if we are going to keep our economy vibrant
71527 its a collection of the same uninspired and uninspiring policies that this administration has offered over the past five years toll it privatize it lease it sell it or congestion price it
71528 its an old roof built in 1987 with a 15 year life expectancy
71529 we dont agree with it the ruling and we will seek a court review
71530 steve was a committed father and a tremendous asset to the company
71531 president stroger has made it clear that there is no room for corruption or fraud in county government upon learning of allegations of misconduct at provident hospital the administration took swift action and suspended three individuals suspected of involvement in illegal activity
71532 if these allegations turn out to be true its just further evidence that theres no serious management oversight of county government this is the first place that you would think president stroger would be watching over given the history
71533 will the film series evermore known as indy lite hold up when compared directly to a revived indiana jones
71534 next time i say weve been in tougher spots than this i mean this
71535 would go to the legislative bodies and recommend opening up the process and i think well do that
71536 i dont know how huntzicker thinks he can give a deadline because he doesnt do anything on the pyramid
71537 at the end of the day were still talking thats all we can do
71538 we need to come to some closure on this issue
71539 its enforceable to the degree that we can move forward with opening it back up if bass pro is not interested in moving forward
71540 we believe we have a good vision and concept for the pyramid
71541 were pro memphis if someone else comes to the table and has a better idea were not fighting it
71542 but i think weve had the bid process open before and nothing has materialized
71543 will the film series evermore known as indy lite hold up when compared directly to a revived indiana jones
71544 next time i say weve been in tougher spots than this i mean this
71545 with so many users our bandwidth is somewhere in the 90 percent usage range
71546 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
71547 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
71548 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
71549 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
71550 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
71551 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
71552 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
71553 if thats high usually your registration will be high overall
71554 its no secret that we get a lot of complaints in there and we are using national night out to send a clear message
71555 the message is the neighborhood and police department have organized and we will fight back
71556 we have been a part of this event and are maintaining the tradition that was started in the past
71557 its also a great way to create relationships between the community and the police force
71558 i dont know if surprised is the right word but im very disappointed
71559 i was hoping it would lead to a favorable result for us
71560 we hoped this sale would go through and it didnt
71561 but we arent starting from square one there are options on the table for the board to consider
71562 those are just a couple of options and the board is reviewing all alternatives for the site
71563 youre going to see a lot of bumping jostling for position and crashes
71564 you can sit there and have your cup of coffee
71565 the rider in front isnt likely the one who wins
71566 hes the one strategically protecting his team leader behind him
71567 the better guys will work with their teammates and work behind them so their legs stay fresh and then they break away
71568 youre going to see a bunch of people riding together you may see someone break away the big question is will they be able to stay away you usually see them try to break away in groups and get swallowed up at the front and spit out in the back
71569 at numerous times ive written donate back on tickets ive bought
71570 ive always looked at it as being a good cause
71571 hes just a genuinely nice person in any way you deal with him
71572 he does so much to help out organizations in the community and he doesnt want recognition
71573 i enjoy helping i think that brings joy to all of us when we can help when you do its a good feeling
71574 when you think about it its a pretty cool thing
71575 but i think itd be neat if that would happen more often it would be nice if this inspired others to do it
71576 nicknamed fast freddie for the simple reason that in his prime few professional racers could surpass him pedal stroke for pedal stroke once speeds exceed 40 mph the ones who could were the ones who went on to win sprints at the tour de france and other big races look for him to launch a rock teammate or try to take the win for himself
71577 generally considered one of the savviest and most strategical cyclists in the world not just the u s who has been able to ride far beyond his physical talent by using his brain as much as his legs
71578 probably the fastest man racing in america right now his genetics and training have combined in that rare peak that lets racers bottle lightning the problem is that holding onto the lightning is notoriously difficult will he fry the rest of the field before he burns himself out
71579 when he raced in europe and was one of the top riders in the world hamilton was considered one of the nicest pros ever to grace the pack a drug scandal a ban and a revived career later the olympic medalist finds himself branded as one of rock racings bad boys love him for his tenacity or hate him for his purported drug use either way you have to admit hes a fascinating character
71580 growing up in our neighborhood in the early 60s was awesome
71581 after a long summers day of swimming my mom would open the front door and yell candy scramble and all the kids from the block would come running as my mom threw handfuls of candy
71582 so she would baby sit for the neighborhood and firemens kids she baby sat for hundreds of children over the years and later many of them brought their children to her as well
71583 the children were like my own and all have come back to see me through the years
71584 id have hot dog days popsicle days and watermelon days too
71585 she watches my two younger girls and my sisters 9 month old grandson jimmy i call my mom the pied piper of hoffman because she always had kids around her and still does even at the age of 90
71586 i believe if im going to bring something into my classroom and teach it to my kids im going to do it the right way by getting hands on first
71587 i became passionate with the story because it was so local i brought it into the classroom and had a blast explaining to my students how this ice age mammal was found 15 minutes away so they thought that was cool
71588 then the great find happened here in 2005 and brought back the same excitement
71589 every student in anns class for the past 10 years just hangs on every word she says
71590 thats just her ability to relate to the students so whenever we have an exciting project with the forest preserve i know her class will be interested because ann is interested
71591 there are so many wetlands throughout the county and state and they are all candidates to have housed mastodons and mammoths
71592 so its a crapshoot most ancient elephants are found during restoration work for other projects
71593 if those teeth hadnt been found theres no way anyone would have found the rest of this
71594 this would have all been the middle of nowhere the ones that we do find were lucky to find them
71595 we dont really study the ice age in school which is what makes this opportunity unique
71596 we get dirty but its well worth it especially if we find a skeleton
71597 um derartige waffen in deutschland verkaufen zu k nnen ben tigt man eine genehmigung vom bundeskriminalamt bka
71598 for it is written that a son of arabia would awaken a fearsome eagle he wrath of the eagle would be felt throughout the lands of allah and lo while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced for the wrath of the eagle cleansed the lands of allah and there was peace
71599 if theyre pointing to the governor as the worst in america theyre just following his lead
71600 plus they stole the name from wonkette at least be creative
71601 gostei do debate porque voc tem um tempo mais longo para poder atrav s da televis o discutir os problemas de s o paulo
71602 o primeiro turno est come ando ainda cada coisa vem a seu tempo
71603 h dois ansiosos na vida os pol ticos e as jornalistas
71604 foi muito bom alckmin ter me dado a oportunidade de esclarecer uma acusa o p rfida e pol tica que n o procede
71605 tive minhas contas aprovadas pelo tribunal de contas e pela c mara
71606 r 91 milh es de super vit e r 348 milh es no banco
71607 para mim o mais importante foi pedir o voto de confian a do eleitor para que eu possa ser prefeita de novo me sinto fortalecida
71608 uma oportunidade para apresentar avan os e propostas e que venha outro debate
71609 this is a dream remember that all of this is in your mind and you can take control of it
71610 im still here its still happening i cant stop it
71611 you did it dr dawn i changed my dream i could fly again
71612 its unprofessional besides i can date whoever i want on my own time
71613 bob the truck driver i dont think so on him its obviously a pseudonym
71614 besides i dont pay you to comment on my love life
71615 if you want to come to work monday go and enjoy your weekend now
71616 i felt the baby kick shes going to be quite a girl
71617 its a way to make history more real to them and make people aware about how their community was founded
71618 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
71619 the county of fresno and the public guardian are to be applauded for immediately recognizing the rights of the family to care for their loved one and taking the steps to allow that process to be accomplished quickly and without delay
71620 the court from the earliest stages of this proceeding proffered rulings of wisdom and gave substance and value to janet riveras life the sanctity of life was honored and we thank the lord for the wonderful outcome in this case
71621 when ms emrich contacted us on july 21st brian was quick to take this on we are very pleased that the family will be allowed to care for ms rivera and that public officials listened to ms riveras family
71622 if the courts decide that the public guardian has the right to make medical decisions for rivera and that the public guardian can dehydrate rivera to death against the wishes of the family then everyone who does not have a legal advanced directive will be able to be killed by dehydration
71623 remember rivera is not otherwise dying she is cognitively disabled and unlikely to return to a cognitive condition if people who are cognitively disabled can be dehydrated to death then the lives of many people with cognitive disabilities will be directly threatened when they experience significant health problems
71624 god chose us in christ before the world began to be holy and blameless in his sight
71625 if mccain picked a woman it would certainly get the attention and perhaps votes of some democrats and a number of independents who supported hillary clinton
71626 shes got it all and is a remarkable leader who brings a number of good qualities to the table
71627 this fall theres going to be a lot of energy surrounding the obama campaign and we need to find ways to generate a substantial amount of energy around the mccain campaign and an effective dynamic different kind of vice presidential nominee i think would make a difference
71628 a mother of five is a genuine alaskan is a hunter is a dog sledder is very much for drilling for oil has a great reform reputation took on big oil on behalf of the people of alaska
71629 i think she would bring a level of excitement and uniqueness that people would have to stop and say boy this is kind of intriguing
71630 if mccain was smart he would beg and plead with bobby jindal to be his running mate
71631 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
71632 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face
71633 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71634 he was describing that he was new to the political scene
71635 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
71636 its clear hes going to play the race card all the way to november and maybe beyond
71637 if you criticize him youre a racist to one degree or another
71638 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
71639 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
71640 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the buying a laptop
71641 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
71642 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
71643 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
71644 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
71645 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
71646 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
71647 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
71648 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71649 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
71650 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
71651 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71652 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71653 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
71654 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
71655 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
71656 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71657 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
71658 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
71659 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71660 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71661 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
71662 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
71663 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
71664 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
71665 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
71666 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
71667 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
71668 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
71669 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71670 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
71671 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71672 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71673 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
71674 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
71675 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
71676 the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
71677 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
71678 in the months ahead the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
71679 the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
71680 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
71681 in the months ahead the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
71682 theyve taken out some of the more inappropriate language but its still the same story and all of the same songs
71683 but the overall message and all of the characters are pretty much intact as it was when it ran on broadway
71684 so we not only love the show but a large part of the subject matter is something we identify with
71685 and we are passionate about representing as authentically as we can
71686 i love it rent is one of my all time favorite musicals
71687 its why i started getting involved in theater so i cant believe im playing one of the parts in the show
71688 shes kind of like an anarchist shes crazy and wild and very different from me but thats what makes it so challenging
71689 we are warning against a growing culture of bans and regulations in germany
71690 i have a responsibility to make sure that our state has enough money to pay its bills
71691 it is a terrible situation to be in i dont think any governor wants to be in this situation but this is really the only way out at this point
71692 the state of california the elected leadership cannot put the important public servants of california in harms way
71693 we put people first we make sure we protect their interests and thats why i have to tell the governor with all due respect i am not going to comply with this order
71694 people are going to get put out of their homes
71695 the governor says hes sorry we cant pay with sorry
71696 we believe budget reform is an essential element and we also appreciate there may be some tax loopholes that need to be closed
71697 this is a government that has come to the end of its road
71698 it doesnt make any difference who heads kadima they are all part to a string of failures by this government
71699 the right thing to do when the prime minister goes is to let the people choose who will lead them and whoever is chosen he is the one who will need to put together a government
71700 the arabs are asking themselves how useful an agreement with olmert would be because he is a self proclaimed lame duck and he will have a hard time to get his deals approved
71701 its true that olmert was enthusiastic about the peace process and he spoke about this process with great attention but this process has not achieved any progress or breakthrough
71702 it is in the countrys interest to form the broadest possible government in order to stabilize the situation and to face the challenges israel can expect
71703 ehud olmert has mercifully spared israel the shameful potential ignominy of having a prime minister indicted while in office
71704 we found that in fish that do have temperature dependent sex determination tsd a rise in water temperature of just 1 5 degrees celsius can change the male to female ratio from 1 1 to 3 1
71705 if climate change really does result in a rise of 4 degrees which is the maximum the ipcc predicts and if species cant adapt in time or migrate then in the most sensitive cases of tsd were looking at extinction
71706 it could be because of chemical pollution or it could be because of climate change we dont know
71707 they werent just in the house a lot of them were out pretty much exposed to the elements i described it as a zoo from hell many of the animals were outside in deplorable conditions
71708 to be blunt about it when the wind shifted it was one of the worst things ive ever smelled
71709 water was not made readily available and the water bowls the water containers that were most of them were filled with algae some had feces they were disgusting they were filthy the rabbits pellets had their own droppings
71710 my husband has had me stay home for the last five years i stayed home for my children so the money definitely benefited my family
71711 theres no reason to think that suddenly theres 30 percent more people who have suddenly had this inner feeling to help out people and whats changed its the economy
71712 the donors will make in the area of 7 000 and the surrogates will make anywhere from 20 000 to 30 000 plus
71713 we really try to have people who donate for altruistic reasons thats the best of all worlds sometimes you cant be absolutely certain you can only be certain of what a person tells you
71714 its more invasive than donating sperm but still its painless and theres more time involved but we try to make it as smooth a process as possible
71715 a super rich pal who was closely involved with the campaign finances is helping john its likely this man doesnt know all the dirty details of johns extramarital affair but is acting out of loyalty and is not asking a lot of questions only writing the checks
71716 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71717 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71718 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71719 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering hes offering bush economic policies and karl rove politics
71720 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
71721 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day
71722 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track
71723 im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right here quick draw
71724 if barack obama wants this so called duel then why did he and his entourage run for the hills when john mccain challenged him to 10 town halls
71725 she has the ability now to make black and white daughters or red and white daughters that could sell in fact we sold five daughters of her yesterday as well separately
71726 so her pedigree and her physical structure are what make her very marketable and the fact that shes red is the icing on the cake
71727 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
71728 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton rev jackson sen mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
71729 shell is making substantial targeted investments to grow the company for shareholders and help ensure that energy markets remain well supplied
71730 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
71731 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
71732 the obama campaign does a wonderful job of presenting their candidate in the most popular light that they can get and they do a very good job at it
71733 im going to let the american public decide what is negative and what is not negative
71734 but im going to do everything in my power to protect my candidate and to define the race in terms that i think are appropriate
71735 sen obama is an impressive speaker and the beauty of his words have attracted many people especially among the young to his campaign
71736 i applaud his success all americans should be proud of his accomplishments my concern with sen obama is with issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
71737 the campaign is making him seem angrier than he is and therefore its a disservice to him
71738 john mccain is simply not a relevant variable in this election
71739 this careening from message to message makes them look like they dont have one specific thing they want to say about this guy and that there is no centralized theme there is no centralized message
71740 he doesnt seem to have anything positive to say about me does he
71741 you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against
71742 i would say that it is beyond dispute that he has become the biggest celebrity in the world
71743 the question that we are posing to the american people is this is he ready to lead yet
71744 i do notice that he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself
71745 i figured id come over and straighten out we have no intention of participating in todays hearing its a total waste of time we have sufficent laws on the books that we enforce to deal with this issue
71746 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
71747 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest of it we can deal with
71748 so as far as all this grandstanding and foolishness waste of city time on this issue and the fact that i felt aggravated enough about it to interrupt my workout to come over and set the record straight lapd has no intention of participating in this farce
71749 there are currently on the books sufficient laws rules and regulations
71750 zine doesnt know what the hell he is talking about
71751 they act like a pack of wolves stalking their prey
71752 what im hear to do is listen im here to try and find a balanced answer theres no question that the industry of public information is an important one to protect and i think that theres responsibility on the side of entertainers as there is responsibly on the side of those seeking to take photographs
71753 without know who is following you you do not know why you are being followed which brings about a very really possibility of suffering harm
71754 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
71755 i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do that
71756 im here to make sure that our state functions and whatever it takes i will do it
71757 it seems that increased enforcement has played a significant role
71758 it challenges the idea that there is no way to deal with the problem but for creating some kind of legal status for illegal immigrants
71759 our data arent inconsistent with the idea that people are leaving
71760 i dont see in my numbers anywhere near the decline hes talking about
71761 the president knows that we resolve nothing by taking these kinds of punitive actions
71762 he says he wants comprehensive reform yet all he does is enforcement with no steps to legalize the status of those workers
71763 im going to be talking to my colleagues to put an end an end to these raids
71764 america is better greater than these conditions which we have created in postville
71765 there is nothing humane nor practical about creating a state of terror in immigrant communities aimed at driving millions of humble hardworking people from our midst
71766 a graceful personal and political history a gentle account from a tough politician
71767 readers will appreciate the spirit the sincerity and the context of the message delivered by one of the most powerful women in the nation
71768 never losing faith we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights but women werent just waiting women were working never losing faith we worked to redeem the promise of america that all men and women are created equal for our daughters and our granddaughters today we have broken the marble ceiling for our daughters and our granddaughters now the sky is the limit
71769 i find it humbling and deeply moving when women and girls approach me looking for insight and advice if women can learn from me in the same way i learned from the women who came before me it will make the honor of being speaker of the house even more meaningful
71770 this car doesnt have a carbon footprint more of a crater
71771 it would have been far more efficient to fly mechanics out there
71772 this horrifies me it is another example of how rich people exploit and pollute the planet because of their money
71773 flying a car thousands of miles for a service is ludicrous when planes are one of the most polluting ways to transport goods we urge the individual to get their car serviced closer to home
71774 if an owner wants to service his car in that way it is his choice
71775 im not surprised thankfully the age of excess in some areas continues
71776 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
71777 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71778 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71779 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
71780 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
71781 accusing your black opponent of playing the race card is the ultimate racist campaign tactic posted by seamus
71782 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71783 the republican campaign is clearly seeking to preemptively rebut any attempt by obama to attribute race to their attacks
71784 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71785 i am black therefore i am automatically a victim everything is whiteys fault so give me your money whitey or youre a racist
71786 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
71787 you notice that i haven t seen an ad yet where he talks about what he s gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they don t have any good answers they know they ve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that you re not real happy with them
71788 i mean that s basically the argument he s too risky
71789 but think about it what s the bigger risk us deciding that we re going to come together to bring about real change in america or continuing to do same things with the same folks in the same ways that we know have not worked i mean are we really going to do the same stuff that we ve been doing over the last eight years that s a risk we cannot afford the stakes are too high
71790 ive already had an hour and a half i mean im so overexposed im making paris hilton look like a recluse
71791 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
71792 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
71793 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
71794 you think the rnc could get this many people of color in a single room maybe if they got hotel staff in there
71795 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position
71796 voters are hearing race charges race tinged rhetoric in the democratic primary campaign
71797 the first black president is destined and its meant to be the threats aint fazing us the nooses
71798 white house theyre going to have to change the name of that building if obama wins
71799 in a contest that is increasingly being fought more over character than issues
71800 mr martin since when did character no longer count when selecting a president
71801 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71802 if race is not a big deal in this country why so many comments in such a small time frame after martin posted this
71803 mccain has really run a ridiculous campaign he is outclassed outsmarted and needs to go back to his ranch to get some sleep america doesnt want his tired ideas and false promises posted by july 31 2008 at 12 02 pm
71804 if mccain was a racist why would he adopt a child of color posted by just wondering july 31 2008 at 01 16 pm
71805 i will blame mccain for something i predict mccain will do
71806 obama doesnt look like all the other presidents on dollar bills
71807 we all know mcsame has played it with his brittany paris ad trying to make it like obama likes young white woman
71808 if mccain was a racist why would he adopt a child of color
71809 and all you other politicians trying to hate on my man watch us win a majority vote in every state on my man you cant stop whats bout to happen we bout to make history the first black president is destined and its meant to be the threats aint fazing us the nooses or the jokes so get off your ass black people its time to get out and vote paint the white house black and im sure thats got em terrified
71810 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71811 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71812 outside parties including the north carolina gop and an ohio talk show host
71813 black people been voting for democrats for 50 years and they still poor
71814 becasue after november it will be worth nothing i been through this before and it doesnt work for a small number of people you think it will work for 10 times as many
71815 this is a major dumb move by obama obamas appeal is based on unity transcending race and sharing the values of mainstream america
71816 in the news or on cnn even even mentioned it
71817 racism is a person of power or someone in the majorit
71818 how dare that black guy think he is smart enough to run for president
71819 in the news or on cnn even even mentioned it
71820 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
71821 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
71822 now with the contest entering a new more negative phase one largely brought on by mccain
71823 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
71824 the mccain campaign continues to look pretty much like one being run by a guy who finished fifth from the bottom of his naval academy graduating class trying to compete against a guy who was president of harvard law review it is what it is my friends
71825 you will never hear mention of obamas plans for unilateral disarmament because obama who never served in the military is too busy reminding us he is the black man in the race posted by obama will disarm
71826 boy that young guy has some great new ideas but i just dont know something seems different about him i dont feel comfortable with new ideas
71827 dont you remember he has a funny name and his father is from another country anything he says is a secret plot against america
71828 boy that young guy has some great new ideas but i just dont know something seems different about him i dont feel comfortable with new ideas
71829 dont you remember he has a funny name and his father is from another country anything he says is a secret plot against america
71830 i know hes going to do it any second now
71831 f k that f k that n r no f king way
71832 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71833 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71834 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71835 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
71836 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
71837 would commit the u s to spending 0 7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid
71838 he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
71839 hi my name is scott denham i just moved in to the palisades with my wife and two young children twenty seconds left im here because we have a major major rodent problem theres an infestation on my neighbors property its spilling over and its posing a serious health risk to my family ten seconds left i need your help were not getting any help from the city or the county
71840 rosendahls deputy reported that the councilmans office has contacted the appropriate agencies in the city and the issue is being addressed as expeditiously as possible
71841 that number could be monstrous you could get numbers approaching hundreds of thousands of rats its impossible to quantify
71842 this is the first time ive heard of someone living with that many rats we dont have problems to that level
71843 the commercial use of 3 d technology and 3 d content to create attention grabbing digital signage has great potential for telstras enterprise and government customers
71844 3 d tv used to be a dream something youd see in futuristic film or at a theme park
71845 the availability of 3 d content in games or movie format is growing quickly so were excited to plug the gap with australias first 3 d plasma tv i was very pleasantly surprised when i first saw this 3 d big screen experience
71846 3 d is here to stay with hollywood studios producing hugely successful 3 d movies for cinema audiences
71847 right now many of the most popular pc games can be experienced in 3 d on samsungs 450 series plasma tvs using ddds tridef 3 d experience software and available 3 d glasses
71848 going to school in the fall im looking for the ideal alarm clock to beat the late nights and what not and noticed a few digital photo frames alarm clocks i want a decent that has battery backup and good resolution on the screen for viewing photos an auxiliary audio jack would be a major plus which one do you guys recommend that falls under the 200 dollar mark thanks a million

71871 a los se ores due os para que vengan por aqu y empecemos a negociar
71872 este gobierno ha llegado a su final y da igual qui n vaya a encabezar kadima todos son part cipes del fracaso absoluto de este gobierno
71873 la responsabilidad nacional exige mirar al pueblo y convocar elecciones
71874 kadima est que se cae a trozos y es muy poco probable que ninguno de sus candidatos sea lo suficientemente fuerte como para lograr apoyos mayoritarios en el parlamento a la hora de tomar alguna decisi n lo m s probable es que acaben celebr ndose elecciones anticipadas en la primavera de 2009
71875 el representante del pp en el pacto reconoci meridianamente que en d nia hubo transfuguismo y dijo que tomar an las medidas que consideraran oportunas
71876 no es posible debido a la unanimidad mostrada por todos los partidos con lo sucedido en esta localidad

71882 las causas de la muerte de la criatura se debieron a la falta de ox geno y a la poca resistencia de los beb s a las altas temperaturas de los espacios cerrados

71886 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
71887 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
71888 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
71889 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done
71890 that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
71891 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
71892 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
71893 es muy dif cil saber lo que va a hacer alguien con la mente que parece que tiene de juana el s bado saldr a la calle y a partir de ese momento estar en libertad lo que no quiere decir que pueda hacer todo lo que tenga pensado hacer porque es evidente que hay cosas que no le vamos a dejar hacer como faltar a las v ctimas
71894 una gran verg enza para el psoe y para el gobierno socialista
71895 habiendo hecho trampas cometiendo irregularidades falseando la realidad y saliendo antes de tiempo
71896 siempre hemos dicho que las penas habr a que cumplirlas ntegramente y por tanto no deber a haber salido nunca de la c rcel
71897 es una gran verg enza para el psoe y para el gobierno socialista
71898 cuando se dicen estas cosas es porque hay un caldo de cultivo
71899 los par metros sangu neos de gran n mero de atletas rusas nos hac an creer en un dopaje generalizado con epo o con transfusiones de sangre
71900 pero esas sospechas s lo las pod amos confirmar con an lisis de orina y all no encontr bamos nada no ya en la orina recolectada en los controles en competici n donde ya los organismos se habr an limpiado de lo que hubieran tomado sino lo que era m s extra o tampoco en los controles por sorpresa durante los periodos de entrenamiento as que con la mosca detr s de la oreja gabriel doll el director del departamento antidopaje puso en marcha un verdadero plan de inteligencia
71901 ya en abril tuvimos datos concretos para acusar a las siete de haber sustituido fraudulentamente su orina por la de otras personas en algunos controles
71902 pero debimos esperar antes de actuar a que la agencia mundial antidopaje ama validara nuestra investigaci n y nos dijera que para adelante y tambi n a que un instituto oficial diera validez a los an lisis de adn
71903 ha sido una decisi n pol tica nuestros excelentes resultados han molestado a pa ses y federaciones rivales
71904 es una enfermedad rara no frecuente pero ahora ya sabemos c mo describirla
71905 mi compromiso era retirarme de la vida p blica y de la vida literaria a cambio estados unidos cumplir a sus obligaciones
71906 con esto quer a decir que temo por mi vida porque si holbrooke quiere mi muerte deseo saber si su brazo es lo bastante largo como para llegar hasta aqu
71907 actuar como lo har a ante una cat strofe natural o un ataque contra mi persona
71908 tambi n quiero que sepa que una defensa de esta clase suele presentar desventajas
71909 la campa a de terror del cerco de sarajevo con miles de civiles muertos
71910 es que hay alguien que a n no sepa que estoy aqu

71913 este tribunal no hace as las cosas se or karadzic pres ntelos de forma adecuada
71914 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
71915 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
71916 no hay un incremento en el n mero de funcionarios
71917 que durante esta semana se hayan vuelto a producir los mismo incidentes
71918 it was the first time they appeared at the court and its said that their trial will start on august 7 we dont know yet whether defense lawyers have been arranged for them or not
71919 family members are normally contacted but we have not been contacted by anyone so far we are really worried about them
71920 i think two issues are going to overshadow what both sides want to do one is the lingering feeling from the beef demonstrations and then this more recent territorial dispute over the dokdo islands
71921 certainly the president doesnt have much time and its somewhat of a legacy issue for him
71922 hes going to focus particularly on verification and moving forward with north korea and getting advice on that
71923 north korea can surprise it can surprise in all kinds of ways but they rarely meet a deadline
71924 without this action which we hope the north will take the delisting will not occur on that time line
71925 i think that it certainly didnt enhance the atmosphere for the visit but on the other hand the president has demonstrated leadership
71926 and we have a very very good relationship with the south
71927 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
71928 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
71929 the clearest evidence to date that pakistani intelligence officers are actively undermining american efforts to combat militants in the region
71930 the indians are absolutely convinced its true and theyre right
71931 haqqani has been at the center of the insurgency for the past three years
71932 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
71933 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
71934 a game like wow requires only voluminous amounts of time in order to be good at it
71935 the chinese group which shall consist of persons who in fact are or who except in the case of persons who in fact are members of a race or class or tribe referred to in paragraph 1 2 3 5 or 6 are generally accepted as members of a race or tribe whose national home is in china
71936 under the kind of legislation which allows an admitted chinese born in canton to be declared a white south african anything can happen
71937 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
71938 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
71939 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
71940 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
71941 we understand that once you start taking classes you either want to keep going and earn your bachelors or life happens and you have to slow down
71942 when you get the thumbs up from the spectators who line the course
71943 these are boats anyone can drive and when we take them out in a competition like the shootout we get the opportunity to showcase our products and people get a chance to see the boats performs
71944 we wanted to prove that pontoons were not just something for the family man or for an old man people have different priorities at different stages of their lives i want people to find everything they want in our boats not everyone wants one of the go fast boats
71945 we may not be the fastest boats on the water but we are definitely having the most fun
71946 back when we first started running in the shootout a lot of people thought it was funny but i think we changed their mind
71947 with so many users our bandwidth is somewhere in the 90 percent usage range
71948 if we can contribute in any way to the training of prosecutors that is definitely our goal
71949 the greater emphasis we place on aggressive dui prosecution the fewer lives we lose on the highways
71950 at numerous times ive written donate back on tickets ive bought
71951 ive always looked at it as being a good cause
71952 hes just a genuinely nice person in any way you deal with him
71953 he does so much to help out organizations in the community and he doesnt want recognition
71954 i enjoy helping i think that brings joy to all of us when we can help when you do its a good feeling
71955 when you think about it its a pretty cool thing
71956 but i think itd be neat if that would happen more often it would be nice if this inspired others to do it
71957 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
71958 he learned early on running was his way to relieve stress
71959 it was one of the most meaningful communions ive ever taken
71960 many many people put many many hours into how it ended up too
71961 even though the groundwork had been laid a while ago
71962 im not sure there really is one guy that we target as the anchor of this trade
71963 andy laroche was one of the best prospects in all of baseball and were thrilled to get him
71964 i think they understand the direction were going in and some even appreciate it right now though its a shock jason bay above and beyond everything else is a great person hes what we hope all future pirates aspire to be a real model
71965 ive always been happy here but im just glad its over one way or the other
71966 i understand theres skepticism based on the history but i believe the fans will see very quickly that this isnt the same old story
71967 weve made trades here based on sound baseball judgment and building a championship caliber organization not for financial reasons and were confident people will see that
71968 we said no time and again and we were doing that right up until the final minute
71969 maybe with two laroches you can generate one decent season between them
71970 i believe hed consider any team so he could stick it to the packers
71971 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
71972 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
71973 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
71974 we discovered that around 18 months there was a decline in cognitive function and responsiveness to adult guidance
71975 all of a sudden we were running the first infant day care center in the united states
71976 hows a government supposed to protect the freedom of its unquestioning citizens if it cant designate anyone foreigner or american as an enemy combatant on the basis of unrevealable secret evidence and hold them at extraterritorial military installations without charge
71977 name me one civilized democratic nation thats been able to do that
71978 our exacting requirements for a less restrictive working environment made for a long and difficult search
71979 we realized that a nebulous region of the caribbean famed for disappearances and inexplicable happenings fit the bill pretty well
71980 there was one black male reporter one black female reporter and one black cameraman at all the stations
71981 edie was the first one who felt it was necessary for you to know who the movers and shakers in town were and quietly introduced you to them and gave you references and all things that were specifically required for a reporter to have early success
71982 it wasnt the norm to see black people on tv back in the 60s she made you proud to watch her she was beautiful and had this poise about her when i got a chance to meet her in person she didnt disappoint at all she was warm and friendly a really good person
71983 she encouraged me to go to school so i went to night school and eventually became a cameraman from edie i learned how to speak right pronounce words correctly because if you didnt shed get after you
71984 when you were on the street with her it was like being out with your mother wed go shopping have lunch theres nobody like her and nobody will ever be like her
71985 she was a gracious and gorgeous woman who loved people and was touched by the stories she did
71986 some people in this business are fake edie was real
71987 i remember thinking this lady really has class shes going to make it in this town
71988 in those days if you were beautiful and successful you had a tendency to look down at others
71989 i never saw any of that in edie she was friendly with children adults the haves and the have nots nothing went to her head
71990 we saw her every day in the building you saw her water the plants on her days off channel 10 was her home shed come in and shed stay for 20 minutes or 20 hours even when she was off
71991 she had not gone out to pasture she could kick it and work and thats what people loved about her
71992 edie was the nicest person she was genuine im devastated i really am
71993 she knew much more about culture and social issues than i do she always stayed current always sought out young people and shared the wisdom and knowledge she had
71994 there have been 12 presidents and she worked with seven of them
71995 we took into consideration the ethical problems that caused him to be fired as professor and the fact that he was indicted on charges of illegally trading in human eggs
71996 it is satisfying but its more of a personal satisfaction
71997 its not like i have any vendetta against the rangers this is where i started toward what ive become as a pitcher
71998 i was successful because i threw first pitch strikes these guys are aggressive early in the count its essentially the same knuckleball i had when i left here ive gained a lot of experience between that time and this time before it was kind of throw and hope i couldnt control it
71999 youve got to give the guy credit just because we didnt do very well against him but we were always getting ourselves out with a lot of lazy fly balls weak ground balls
72000 everybody was getting out on their front foot the hitters have to do a better job we were in the game in the end but for the most part we werent
72001 once we got dickey out of there and saw normal pitching we started hitting but it was too late
72002 but i couldnt get ahead of hitters when you fall behind against guys up here youre going to pay for it
72003 and quite a few of her bridge buddies would go with her
72004 when buying a domain remember to be as anonymous as possible especially in the online casinos market since you want to avoid being price gouged by greedy sellers
72005 i think two issues are going to overshadow what both sides want to do one is the lingering feeling from the beef demonstrations and then this more recent territorial dispute over the dokdo islands
72006 certainly the president doesnt have much time and its somewhat of a legacy issue for him
72007 hes going to focus particularly on verification and moving forward with north korea and getting advice on that
72008 north korea can surprise it can surprise in all kinds of ways but they rarely meet a deadline
72009 without this action which we hope the north will take the delisting will not occur on that time line
72010 i think that it certainly didnt enhance the atmosphere for the visit but on the other hand the president has demonstrated leadership
72011 and we have a very very good relationship with the south
72012 all he said was i heard about your son how good he is and told her shes doing a great job
72013 we consider this incident an inadvertent mistake we have contacted both the conference conference usa office and the ncaa with the information
72014 being out here just running and being in the huddle its just a great feeling to be out here in football instead of in rehab by myself
72015 jamelle is ahead because hes played and been around and went through the spring
72016 hes the no 1 guy and well go from there but nobody has the jersey plastered on their back anybody can win the job but hes on the top of the heap right now and well see how it goes
72017 it feels great to be out there with the team just be back into the routine
72018 it just feels great to be back out there with the guys again
72019 mitigate the effects of the advertising downturn and to manage its balance sheet conservatively and these are key factors in moodys affirmation of the existing ratings
72020 theres carnage in the newsrooms overseas particularly in the states where some five thousand people have lost their jobs this year alone
72021 theres also been a massive reduction in reporting on foreign news and certain categories of news
72022 cost cutting alone is not a good enough strategy while locally we are seeing investigative journalism taking a back seat in the us cost cutting is not affecting investigative journalism which is seen as a unique benefit instead certain categories of jobs are being cut were seeing photographers and subs leaving newsrooms while more shrewd newspapers are reinvesting the wall street journal is investing in online subs online video and other web skills
72023 overall you are looking at growth in ad revenue that is only set at some 10 monthly then if you take media inflation into account we are in negative growth territory
72024 were feeling the effects of a downturn and decline in advertising in that we are finding it difficult to make budget and pay commissions then advertisers are pushing as much as possible for the best deal and discounts budgets are shifting the outlook is very fluid and difficult to predict
72025 were moving toward a more innovative use of environments where were looking to engage the consumer well use less hard sell and more brand elevation to connect emotionally with the consumer well bring in branded consumer entertainment and mix editorial with advertising but do so carefully not to compromise editorial this is a creative advertising approach which will see old block style adverts changing completely with an accent on advertorial targeting and surprising and delighting readers
72026 i dont think the heavy stuff is gonna come down for a while yet
72027 the husband turned the boat around to pick her up and as he was reaching down he fell in
72028 he didnt have a jacket on and wasnt a strong swimmer
72029 why did he she get up at 5am and drive for 2 hrs to the race just to think like that
72030 the gestapo as well as the chinese communists studied the nkvds practices closely
72031 the may be the toughest sporting event i do all year its not the distance its just a 5k and while the course is challenging its around the seattle center with a fair amount of elevation gain thats not the tough part its the start time 11 55
72032 it was nice to get back to someone this close to the area
72033 matt and i have had a knack for promoting shows this is the big show
72034 i have kids its just a good gut check things could be a lot worse it makes me realize how fortunate i am
72035 thats the main reason why i keep doing it its for a great cause
72036 you usually see it in the elderly or older adults
72037 she called and asked me if i was interested in filling out an application for rock for life
72038 we have to authorize and approve everything that is spent
72039 i was wondering what was going to happen with the baby waiting to see if he moved
72040 he comes in and says theres no easy way to tell you this but your son maybe has some kind of heart defect
72041 they werent sure if it was a hole in his heart or what but there was blood and fluid all around his heart
72042 i was actually showing what was wrong with the baby because he couldnt show it
72043 but the doctor told him youre going in that room because your baby is going to have a 25 percent chance of making it out of that room alive he said it didnt look good and he wasnt going to sugar coat it for us
72044 but i said no my baby will be fine i felt it
72045 i knew as soon as they cut him out that he was going to make it
72046 i stayed at allegheny general and they said they would call when the surgery was over
72047 it seemed like eternity but they called and said he was out of surgery that he was doing better
72048 and from there it was just a matter of him getting bigger and stronger
72049 hes five months old and he should be doing more than hes doing
72050 i dont ever want to think hes perfect because i dont know whats going to happen right now hes doing well
72051 were just going day by day we never know whats going to happen or whats going to come our way
72052 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
72053 i said that i am stronger on national security issues because of all the time i spent in the military
72054 mr bateman said the new location was no more than 10 minutes drive away
72055 challenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins
72056 proponents of open source software continue efforts to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products although we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security productivity and total cost of ownership the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model to the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance sales of our products may decline we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products and revenue and operating margins may decline
72057 another development is the software as a service business model under which companies provide applications data and related services over the internet providers use primarily advertising or subscription based revenue models recent advances in computing and communications technologies have made this model viable and enabled the rapid growth of some of our competitors we are devoting significant resources toward developing our own competing software plus services strategies it is uncertain whether these strategies will be successful
72058 an important element of our business model has been to create platform based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions a competing vertically integrated model in which a single firm controls both the software and hardware elements of a product has been successful with certain consumer products such as personal computers mobile phones and digital music players we also offer vertically integrated hardware and software products however efforts to compete with the vertically integrated model may increase our cost of sales and reduce operating margins
72059 nope were not doing it instead were sticking to our vision
72060 nous ne sommes pas seulement un comparateur de prix nous sommes aussi un moteur de shopping
72061 you ve got to realize there s no statute of limitations for the crime of murder so this could very well happen at this stage of my life i cannot engage in fanciful reveries this is a very real thing that we re talking about here i ve established jurisdiction on a federal and state level for the prosecution of bush for two crimes conspiracy to commit murder and murder on a federal level we re really only talking about the attorney general in washington d c operating through his department of justice but on a state level i ve established jurisdiction for the attorney general in each of the fifty states plus the hundreds of district attorneys in counties within those states to prosecute george bush for the murder of any soldier or soldiers from their state or county who died fighting his war in iraq
72062 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

72070 the white house suspended the constitution and implemented continuity of government plans on 9 11 based upon a declared state of national emergency bush has continually renewed the declared state of emergency up until today see this the white house has done everything it could to scare people and convince them that america is under attack as a way to justify the yearly renewal of the declared state of emergency and the continuing unconstitutional seizure of power by the executive branch but congress has the power to revoke the state of emergency specifically the national emergencies act 50 u s c sections 1601 1651 passed in 1976 gives congress the power to countermand a presidential declaration of national emergency indeed in 1976 congress rescinded all of the declarations of national emergency made since world war ii as many of them had been on the books for years and were giving the executive unrestricted powers which were undermining the constitution

72160 one day i know when i go out looking for my lost sheep i could come back with the news that i have discovered the body of a child
72161 i can just sense it the other murdered kiddies were found all around here and i believe keith is here too
72162 even when i called them away the dogs just kept on rolling round going back to the same spot and rolling round again
72163 something white and crumbly like decaying bones came up then something that could have been skin or tissue i couldnt be sure
72164 i didnt know what to think my mind was in turmoil
72165 there have been so many unpredictable dawns in the hunt for keith over the years i didnt want to give false hope yet for sake of keith bennetts tragic family i was willing to accept that it could actually be the little lad
72166 there i was tending my flock when my focus is suddenly concentrated on just on one tiny unidentified lump in the ground
72167 it brought back a flood of childhood memories i remember when police first came looking for bodies it was so bewildering
72168 but then they found a grave with a childs body on the moor and other discoveries followed

72173 there was a row and the boy was swearing at him then he just keeled over he collapsed on the stairs back up to the door of his flat

72183 i had no chance to stop i ran into the front off side of the van and my thigh was trapped between my bike and the front of the van
72184 it was not a blatant piece of dangerous driving but it was careless
72185 it is a great weight off my mind that people now know i was telling the truth about what happened
72186 it does make me angry that during the case i was accused of lying about how fast i was going though
72187 i used to be a body builder and had a very physical job beforehand but i have had to give that up

72190 we anticipate that with fuel prices at historically high levels we will see an increased use of public transport and we remain confident that we can recover the effects of increasing fuel prices
72191 continued revenue growth is expected to be driven in part by the attractiveness of rail over car for long distance journeys and the rising cost of fuel
72192 as the group moves into the final and most important month of its financial year it has become clear that slow trading conditions are being experienced by retailers generally
72193 although the directors continue to be pleased with the groups offering for both this coming christmas as well as for next year it is likely that as a consequence there will be a slower intake by the groups customers than originally anticipated which may have a significant impact on august 2008 sales as well as during the run up to christmas

72230 fitch has got a lot of heart even if in the build up for this fight there is not trash talk believe me august 9 is going to be a great fight
72231 it shows you where the sport is going the top level guys are professionals and behaving as professionals the guys who talk trash and spew all that garbage they dont last they do that stuff because they need that to get attention because they suck as fighters
72232 because of the way i came up through the ufc a lot of people didnt see a lot of my fights people develop an attachment to fighters that they see fight live when they see you in a pay per view or they see you in a live event and they watch you fight they develop a real attachment to you rather than just seeing some of your fights on the playback on like ufc wired or the unleashed show so yeah i think a lot of fans still dont know who i am really they havent developed that kind of attachment or an appreciation for me but its not really their fault i guess its just the way things go we had a stacked weight division and i just kinda slipped through the cracks
72233 i learned a lot of things a lot of things happened in my life i dont want to make any excuses that night i got beat by a better man than i am now for this fight im working really hard making all the sacrifices i havent cut corners im ready to go right now i realize what i have im world champion and i realize last time i didnt really realize what i had between my hands now i know what it is and i dont want to lose it im going to fight to win im not going to fight not to lose im going to fight to win im going to go for the finish
72234 i think its a key factor in any career for someone to be successful if you dont have the confidence in yourself to achieve the things that lay in front of you then youre always going to be a failure i think i struggled early in my wrestling career at purdue because i lacked confidence but ever since ive started fighting ive put myself on the same playing field mentally as all my opponents and my confidence is through the roof just the realization that im just as much of an athlete or just as much of a man as anybody else im facing
72235 i dont even think about it i dont want to make the same mistake twice right now i am going to fight jon fitch for my first title defense and i have the chance to succeed where i failed last time i see it as a great challenge not only because im fighting who i think is the most dangerous guy that ive fought so far but also because last year i lost my first title defense and now i am going to have a chance to redeem myself
72236 as far as wrestling skills go we dont utilize all of wrestling in mma i think my wrestling style is more suitable for mma than a lot of fighters a lot of fighters take shots from open waters and very easily get stuffed i hit takedowns from all angles all directions and im just relentless with what i need to get done i think georges is a very explosive style of wrestling but its a fight its not wrestling so i dont think it even matters
72237 jon fitch is like a new breed of mixed martial arts fighters hes not like the old school guys of course hes a great wrestler thats his first background but hes very good standing up and on the ground as well so hes bringing a lot more problems on the table than the other guys that ive fought in the past im going to have to use a lot more tools than ive been using in the past but i truly believe that fighting wrestlers in my specialty those are the type of people that im the best to fight when i fight wrestlers i always do very well and wrestlers are my favorite guys to fight
72238 one of the biggest things is punching power ive been working a lot with javier mendez and thats kind of his specialty so im hitting at least twice as hard as i used to other than that my cardio is just on another level now in my first time training for 25 minutes i wasnt sure where i could take my body physically but im increasingly surprised with how great of shape im in
72239 im more experienced in big fights but he has fought a lot of very tough competitors and i truly believe that hes the toughest guy that i have fought so far i have been taking my training very seriously ive never been in as good of shape as i am right now ive been training to face an army not a single guy every time im training and i do my sparring i have a fresh guy coming on me all the time and very top quality guy not like the karate teacher on the corner of the street top mma fighters so im very well prepared
72240 thats the thing with koscheck hes really stubborn and he didnt want to listen to anybody and we were telling him to practice his wrestling he had it in his head that nobody could take him down if he didnt want em to literally i dont think he drilled a single takedown that entire training camp he did all standup and very little jiu jitsu even i dont take that approach i havent taken that approach to it i always train everything but ive also gotten back to wrestling basics again just to sharpen things up
72241 its simple when you fight not to lose you dont take chances you dont go for the opening you dont go all in when you fight to win you take that chance its like your mind is free thats how im going to fight im going to fight to win
72242 no man i dont worry about pressure this is a game to me this is all fun its not like im fighting a war or working in a factory or something this is playtime im living a dream there is no pressure win lose draw it doesnt matter im having fun
72243 i now understand that ive got 15 minutes to try to win a bout i really rushed that fight and i made a foolish mistake i had frank in a dominant position and i stood up and fed him a foolish amateur mistake and it was something that we worked on a million times just to be a more controlled fighter and a little more relaxed in there weve been working on that it has to do with just putting time in the gym and thats exactly what ive been doing just trying to polish every aspect of the fight game and try to better myself everyday
72244 the reports of you saying that youre going to get a title shot if you win this fight
72245 i havent been saying that im going to get a title shot they said after the last fight we had a title shot and we didnt get one so im not going to count my chickens before they hatch for sure you know you just gotta concentrate on the task in front of ya and thats kinda what i do if you start getting your hopes up you just get em dashed so the best thing to do is to just concentrate on what we got in front of us and thats lesnar and thats what well go do on august 9 and afterward were worry about how everything else falls into place

72251 the price of plastic resins like polypropylene widely used in textiles and eating and drinking utensils has risen as much as 45 according to the plastics exchange in chicago this is driving demand for renewable alternatives to fossil based plastics promising to deliver the critical mass to the bioplastics market that until now has been missing
72252 the idea behind bioplastic is that you could fill up a bioplastic bag with food waste and throw other bioplastic products like drinks bottles disposable plates and cutlery in a composter and within three months in theory there would be no trace
72253 85 of plastic bags used in the united states are manufactured in the united states taxing or banning plastic carryout bags will result in the direct loss of approximately 4 000 american jobs in addition there will be thousands of resin and distribution company job losses destroying an american manufacturing industry based on myths and misinformation is irresponsible absurd and tragic

72280 we certainly understand and appreciate congresss concern for the well being of servicemembers and other u s personnel deployed in iraq but there seems to be a misperception out there that our facilities in that theater are replete with electrical hazards that have caused hundreds of fires and multiple fatalities
72281 whats more some seem to believe that this department and one of the s lead logistical support contractors are so negligent or callous that we have failed to address these dangers
72282 but it is wrong to suggest that all these deaths were the result of shoddy workmanship by defense contractors or lack of oversight by the pentagon
72283 three more troops were killed while working with electrical generators that were not properly grounded
72284 the remaining four deaths do seem to stem from wiring problems but only one of them involves work done by kbr although the inspector general is still looking into all these incidents
72285 every facility our troops operate out of in iraq is undergoing a safety inspection

72302 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
72303 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
72304 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
72305 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
72306 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
72307 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
72308 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
72309 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible

72314 we had some exciting sales earlier in the year which seemed to provide the new benchmark and flushed out some of the bigger farms we have got on the market now
72315 people think that land is worth 6000 to 7000 acre there are farms at that level but not all of them

72321 politik tritt im web 2 0 kaum in erscheinung eine internetstrategie ist bei den parteien nicht zu erkennen
72322 in der hochphase des letzten bundestagswahlkampfes wurde noch relativ viel mit dem internet gearbeitet doch ber den wahltag hinaus gab es keine initiativen mehr in den sozialen medien von seiten der parteien
72323 im web 2 0 gibt es eine f lle an akteuren die mitmischen und botschaften aussenden das l sst sich nur schwer steuern
72324 politiker besuchen doch auch in nichtwahlkampfzeiten sch tzenfeste warum besuchen sie nicht ebenso die sozialen r ume im internet
72325 die nichtwahlkampfzeiten sollten eigentlich zum aufbau einer nachhaltigen community genutzt werden

72328 after taking a close look at the candidates in this race i was more impressed by senator clintons ability to meet the challenges of the presidency end the war reinvigorate the economy and provide universal healthcare
72329 senator obama offers us the leadership needed to address the challenges guam and our nation will face in the coming years
72330 this is a very history for us to try and come out like this and try and vote for the president of the united
72331 i was walking in the woods following the signal with my receiver trying to find the turtle and i walked into an area where some large trees had fallen down
72332 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there
72333 but as im walking i could see a patch of bare soil that didnt look quite right and when i got closer i could tell it had been cleared and some plants had been planted they looked like theyd been grown somewhere else and then actually replanted in the park
72334 the government of japan believes that stringent measures taken to relieve the two officers showed a serious stance from the u s side in regards to the fire

72342 consider 25 years ago nearly 60 percent of u s petroleum was produced domestically today its 25 percent from its peak in 1970 u s production has declined a staggering 47 percent the world consumes 86 million barrels a day the united states roughly 20 million we need the stuff to run our cars and planes and economy where does it come from
72343 i cannot deliver the state but i have already been trying to be helpful to senator obama and i will continue to do that
72344 i cant even deliver ohio for myself it takes a lot of people to help a candidate win a state ill try to do my part certainly
72345 ive said and i deeply believe that ohio race will be very close very competitive thats the nature of ohio

72348 access to sites in china is continually changing and chinese authorities are not transparent about the censorship process so it is a very difficult thing to keep track of
72349 access to sites in china is continually changing and chinese authorities are not transparent about the censorship process so it is a very difficult thing to keep track of
72350 none of these interest me but im keen to help build something
72351 its an indication i hope to the public that we take this very seriously and were concerned for their safety
72352 as i travel the state at various meetings with people involved in the community and the public theyre talking about transportation which i dont know that they always did
72353 we are safe now we are trying to ensure that safety in more ways than ever before
72354 any kind of shortfall in terms of transportation i think is going to have to come from reprioitization or bonding
72355 even the democrats i think are saying how much is enough in terms of gas tax
72356 traditionally the minnesota legislature has been very deferential to mndot in terms of oversight
72357 but given the bridge collapse this is a time when the public is looking for a little more scrutiny
72358 yesterday during meditation for a brief while and for the first time in ages i had a sense of the presence of christ of the lord here with me speaking to me inviting me to remain in his love and keep his commandments there was a strong sense of my need to respond to the call of conversion i need and want to come closer to jesus otherwise this life is one of meaninglessness and of sterile protection from the world to live life fully jesus must be at the centre
72359 take time to pray to relax to be really yourself warts gifts and all dont get to serious chris
72360 i am having glimpses moments of happiness and contentment in this unfolding present life these eight years will be very rich no matter what happens doubts and regrets will always be with me in the midst of my joys and hopes lots in me that remains unresolved good no matter what the future holds i have had a life of great breadth experience and richness
72361 i am feeling wonderfully alive and invigorated after a game of football this afternoon i came back absolutely exhausted and quite dehydrated yet feeling so vigorous and alive the pure physical joy of movement and of being able to run and jump and shoot what a gift

72364 the clearance of the pathwork test is another step in the continued integration of molecular based medicine into standard practice
72365 in the past scientists have classified different types of cancers based on the organs in which the tumors develop with the help of microarray technology they will be able to classify these types of cancers in a standardized non reader dependent manner based on the patterns of gene activity in the tumor cells
72366 its like being at a cocktail party where the easiest person to listen to is the one closest to you but we all have the ability to keep an ear out for other interesting conversations going on throughout the room
72367 it turns out that calmodulin is doing a similar thing sensing the calcium coming through the closest channel through one ear while the other ear listens to the calcium coming through distant channels across the cell
72368 once a local calcium ion sticks to the c lobe it seldom lets go and so the local calcium dominates
72369 now that we are learning how these drugs actually work
72370 we can contribute our new understanding of calmodulin to the design of next generation drugs with greater potency and fewer side effects
72371 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
72372 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
72373 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
72374 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
72375 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
72376 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
72377 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
72378 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
72379 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life

72386 lamento que al parecer el bocog ha anunciado ahora que habr limitaciones en el acceso a sitios web durante la celebraci n de los juegos tengo entendido tambi n que algunos funcionarios del coi negociaron con los chinos que se bloquear an algunos sitios conflictivos porque no se consideraban relacionados con los juegos
72387 esta flagrante censura de los medios de comunicaci n a ade una promesa rota m s que debilita la afirmaci n de que los juegos contribuir an a mejorar los derechos humanos en china

72392 el primer ministro yusuf raza gilani ha hecho hincapi en el compromiso el gobierno de coalici n con la necesidad de hacer valer los derechos humanos ha manifestado sam zarifi director del programa para asia y ocean a de amnist a internacional le instamos a que tome de inmediato medidas para resolver todos los casos de desaparici n
72393 como primera medida el nuevo gobierno debe aliviar el sufrimiento de los familiares de los
72394 no sabemos si las personas objeto de desaparici n forzada son culpables o inocentes ha se alado sam zarifi pero es esencial respetar su derecho a ser acusadas y juzgadas debidamente ante un tribunal de justicia
72395 con la detenci n de personas en secreto el gobierno de pakist n no s lo viola los derechos de los detenidos sino que tambi n incumple su deber de presentar cargos contra los presuntos responsables de ataques contra civiles y juzgarlos
72396 no quiero ni siquiera contestar a ello es absurdo no me lo creo no es verdad
72397 estoy totalmente seguro de que las personas desparecidas est n bajo el control de organizaciones extremistas

72405 ning n detenido que fuera menor en el momento de su presunto delito debe ser juzgado por comisiones militares que no cuentan con disposici n alguna respecto a la justicia de menores
72406 omar khadr debe ser repatriado y juzgado en canad por un tribunal ordinario o de lo contrario ser puesto en libertad
72407 al seguir persiguiendo y castigando a quienes se pronuncian en favor de los derechos humanos las autoridades chinas han perdido de vista las promesas que formularon cuando se les concedieron los juegos ol mpicos hace siete a os
72408 las autoridades chinas est n empa ando el legado de los juegos deben poner en libertad a todos los activistas pac ficos encarcelados permitir a los periodistas nacionales y extranjeros que informen libremente y avanzar hacia la eliminaci n de la pena de muerte

72411 nos satisface que el coi reconozca de su papel en materia de derechos humanos pero dada la realidad actual nos sorprende su confianza en que los medios de comunicaci n extranjeros podr n informar libremente y en que no habr censura de internet
72412 y el coi debe pronunciarse cuando las autoridades violan los principios ol mpicos generales
72413 adem s los dirigentes mundiales que asistan a los juegos deben alzar p blicamente la voz en favor de los derechos humanos en china y deben apoyar a los activistas individuales de derechos humanos de china si no lo hacen transmitir n el mensaje de que es aceptable que un gobierno sea anfitri n de los juegos ol mpicos en una atm sfera de represi n y persecuci n
72414 es un buen primer paso hacia la rendici n de cuentas por los abusos contra los derechos humanos que tuvieron lugar durante la cumbre del g8 en g nova pero es preciso hacer m s para garantizar que emerge toda la verdad y que los responsables responden plenamente de sus actos
72415 el rendimiento de cuentas por los abusos cometidos por agentes estatales incluidos los funcionarios encargados de hacer cumplir la ley debe ser la norma las autoridades italianas deben poner en pr ctica las recomendaciones de los rganos y organizaciones internacionales pertinentes a este respecto para impedir que hechos as se repitan en el futuro

72433 all the kinds of things you take for granted from an online media perspective you cant do on tv you want to change out an ad it takes days you want to change weighting or targeting and switch to a different type of audience its pretty difficult it was my one foray into the tv space after spending 10 years online and i felt ready to come back
72434 its certainly a challenging advertising market for some right now my assumption is that many papers are largely selling to local advertisers what quadrantone offers is the ability to take their local content these audience and the ability to localize the message for national advertisers and national advertisers get this type of media youre talking about people checking out local news i dont have the data in front of me but the engagement on these sites is substantially higher that will make a difference
72435 were going to continue with what i consider to be an intelligent affiliate strategy the best thing i can do with my time and as we expand the business is bring on more national advertisers were going to double the size of the ad sales team within the next four to six weeks keep in mind this is a company thats only 140 days old so theres only five or six sales people 10 altogether including support the way it works is the better i do for my affiliates the more affiliates ill ultimately have
72436 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society

72451 there were attacks that targeted senior officers and we thank god they failed and our colleagues are safe
72452 investigations are still ongoing to see who was behind the attacks and it is too early to point out motives although they appeared to be of al qaeda style
72453 on monday morning jul 21 we were startled by an explosion in the house of colonel issa al issawi who is known as the leader of the campaign against militants in fallujah and surroundings house
72454 to our surprise the explosion took place on the roof where at least four guards were posted
72455 one of them was warning his colleagues that the other was a suicide attacker and asking them to take cover then another policeman fired towards both of them
72456 all of us ran away and then the second bomb went off many policemen were killed and injured in the two blasts these have again ended our dreams of security
72457 col issawi has been a police officer for over 20 years meaning he is one of saddam husseins officers who agreed to continue although the country was occupied by the americans
72458 people of fallujah know that he helped al qaeda worked with the islamic party and now is the right arm of the american occupation
72459 we knew that many of the members of the awakening forces were members of al qaeda
72460 it was said that about 100 young men were executed inside fallujah police station by the awakening militias in january and february 2007 it became clear later that the executioners were fallujah police leaders following orders issued by the us military from the headquarters next door
72461 it seems that we iraqis will all kill each other as long as this us occupation is paying our leaders to widen the gap between us
72462 were determined to be eligible for transfer following a comprehensive series of review processes
72463 a demonstration of the united states desire not to hold detainees any longer than necessary

72471 al qaeda along with all the fighters and trainees were called mujahideen
72472 mr al marri has been in solitary confinement for over 16 months and often goes as long as 3 weeks without being allowed outside his cell for recreation the lights in mr cell remain on 24 hours a day 7 days a week and he has been denied adequate bedding and clothing mr al marri is able to sleep only 2 hours a night and his physical and mental health have deteriorated significantly
72473 the government had a nurse make sexual advances towards him while he was lying in his hospital bed in a vain attempt to convince him to give up his hunger strike
72474 violent extremist movements such as al qaeda and its associates
72475 the united states must strengthen and expand alliances and partnerships
72476 the us alliance system has been a cornerstone of peace and security for more than a generation and remains the key to our success
72477 freedom of action in the global commons and strategic access to important regions of the world to meet our national security needs
72478 the well being of the global economy is contingent on ready access to energy resources
72479 notwithstanding national efforts to reduce dependence on oil current trends indicate an increasing reliance on petroleum products from areas of instability in the coming years not reduced reliance
72480 we as a nation must strengthen not only our military capabilities but also reinvigorate other important elements of national power and develop the capability to integrate tailor and apply these tools as needed
72481 the department of defense has taken on many of these burdens and will need to institutionalize and retain these capabilities but this is no replacement for civilian involvement and expertise
72482 overall the kinds of capabilities we will most likely need in the years ahead will often resemble the kinds of capabilities we need today
72483 what we must guard against is the kind of backsliding that has occurred in the past where if nature takes it course these kinds of capabilities that is counterinsurgency tend to wither on the vine
72484 us predominance in traditional warfare is not unchallenged but is sustainable for the medium term given current trends
72485 the reality that conventional and strategic force modernization programs are strongly supported in the services and in the congress
72486 iran and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle
72487 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
72488 for these reasons arguably the most important component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
72489 china is one ascendant state with the potential for competing with the united states
72490 for the foreseeable future we will need to hedge against chinas growing military modernization and the impact of its strategic choices upon international security
72491 retreat from democracy and its increasing economic and political intimidation of its neighbors give cause for concern
72492 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
72493 secret swift and extraordinary buildup of communist missiles in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the united states and the nations of the western hemisphere
72494 as far north as hudson bay canada and as far south as lima peru
72495 to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack on the united states requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union
72496 my fellow citizens let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out no one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred
72497 as powerful as a joe louis jab to the solar plexus
72498 the notion that we could just waltz in and inject democracy into an extremely complicated devout and ancient culture smacked still smacks of neocolonialist legerdemain
72499 the surge has reduced violence we should all be thrilled about that and honored by the brilliance of those who have served in iraq but what were talking about here is whipped cream on a pile of fertilizer a regional policy unprecedented in its stupidity and squalor
72500 try as i might to formulate a further response to joe kleins rant i cannot one can argue facts one can differ on interpretation of events or one can discuss policy but one cannot debate raging venom
72501 is that the canard of jewish disloyalty has now apparently found a home at a major msm publication
72502 joe klein is free to say what he wants and the rest of us are free to point out the foolish and ad hominem nature of his pronouncements as well as his past words
72503 they seem to have the power to hurt peoples careers i was really angry about what happened with rob malley you know its amazing to be attacked as an antisemite by extremists who i think are very dangerous and they seem to think when you look at what pete wehner said or what jennifer rubin said on their blog a couple of days ago i cant imagine why time hasnt shut this guy down and fired him and blah blah blah blah blah thats what they want to do they want to stifle opinions that are different from theirs im certainly not going to back down
72504 one of the biggest steps we took was not designing a house that was bigger than we needed
72505 we focused on a larger outdoor living area and a smaller home
72506 other than that its a very simple system that is very easy to maintain
72507 when it dumps just a little bit of rain we can get 2 000 gallons in very little time even with the drought at our current usage we could go 50 weeks without any more rain and still have water the lowest weve ever gotten down to was 4 000 gallons
72508 we have to take navy showers sometimes but there have been no hardships
72509 we eat outside a lot and love to spend time out here in the evenings
72510 installing a rainwater system costs about as much as drilling a well
72511 and it saves us a good bit of money in the long run
72512 one of the challenges was finding people who certify that building products are actually green
72513 a lot of companies are using green as a marketing tool it took a lot of time and research to make sure the products actually were environmentally safe
72514 i felt it was important to take care of what we have been given dont be selfish take care of what we have for future generations
72515 i know where it came from ive played this game a long time
72516 i could bet a lot of money that didnt come from the pitcher thats something they can deal with
72517 yes were still in love very happy and are the perfect couple
72518 ooh i love the way you love the way you love me theres nowhere else id rather be
72519 i didnt understand it when youre 16 you dont know what the hell youre getting into like i had no clue los angeles was a shock to the system
72520 sometimes i am a bit surprised when people come up to me and theyre like youre so nice i didnt expect you to be so cool its so weird because im like well how did you expect me to be im not really sure what peoples preconceived notions are
72521 it was a low point in my life i mean the truth of the matter is i was being irresponsible to begin with i moved to la and never got a licence
72522 i dont know it was just an awful low for me
72523 its so much about innovation and creativity that there are themes in the book that will always ring true
72524 the right stuff is a fascinating story of a period a totally other time now with heroes and adventure the prospect of more chicagoans talking about the right stuff is exciting
72525 i would argue that the right stuff is very literary
72526 he sort of stole styles from the novels of the time
72527 in my mind hes up there with the rcbls all time home run leader clint curry in terms of guys that can hit a ball hard and hit it far
72528 i dont have to say much more than clover hill
72529 theres nothing like being able to see that ballpark and being around all of those guys with all of that baseball knowledge theres not a guy in that ballpark that does not want to win
72530 and its really hard to get out of funks when you dont have the at bats and it just didnt happen for him
72531 it bothers you when you cant do things you could do five or 10 years ago
72532 hes always had great hand eye coordination but i think without the weight hes getting it around a little quicker
72533 we shouldve won this game we shouldve won this game we shouldve won this game
72534 its a heck of a way for the season to end
72535 i didnt know it was gone i knew it was up in the air but the ball hadnt been carrying
72536 they had it defended but c j got a great break and i think thats what threw them off
72537 i even knew the pitch he was going to run on
72538 theyre just a really good hitting team early i was trying to be too fine and nip at the corners i ended up getting too many guys on base and then had to go right after them
72539 its getting close but its not really a lot of pitches by todays baseball it is but 20 30 years ago its not
72540 but that was a long time ago it cut into my fishing time and quite frankly i wasnt good enough
72541 we have a couple newer guys that are 18 19
72542 and even though westons younger than them so much of his role will be leadership hes a good angler his fellow teammates respect him
72543 its not like you have to beat out a big field of kids
72544 so few kids are heavily involved in fly fishing like i am
72545 just having the opportunity to spend every summer out there
72546 the cool thing is theres a lot of collaboration of knowledge because we come from such different parts and fish different waters
72547 the mental aspect is so huge even though he might not catch a fish in the first hour hour and a half he stays calm and its so necessary to have that mentality
72548 as a whole to be competitive on the international scale is pretty tough
72549 well why are you so pensive its your vacation whats on your mind
72550 i really wonder if young chang will make it out of the nexus or not
72551 millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
72552 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4
72553 business conditions for the automobile industry have deteriorated sharply over the past weeks rising oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy have made business conditions significantly more difficult

72579 billin is a community physically divided by a concrete monstrosity which for more than 700 kilometres snakes its way around and through town and villages in which the stateless palestinians live
72580 our party arrived in billin as villagers poured out of friday prayers in the mosque to make their way to the wall two kilometres away the israelis had their answer waiting to counter this civil disobedience tear gas
72581 even the merest sniff of tear gas is enough to make you choke and even vomit the villagers turned and ran but they could not escape the effects and even though they legged it more canisters were fired over the wall
72582 one exploded just yards from where i was standing the full force of its contents erupted among the crops and orchards lining the route back to the village immediately i started choking my eyes watered tears and i couldnt stop retching
72583 for someone like me who has had respiratory problems this was a tough welcome to the on going crisis in the middle east fortunately the effects wore off after ten minutes but nevertheless it was an experience i dont want to repeat
72584 i love the art of hip hop i dont always love the message of hip hop
72585 there are times where even with the artists i love you know theres a message that is not only sometimes degrading to women not only uses the n word a little too frequently but also something im really concerned about its always talking about material things

72602 hes a legend in baseball and this is an opportunity for him to be in a world series
72603 i think its a good opportunity for him you have mixed emotions when you lose a guy like that no question
72604 hes a hall of famer a cooperstown man and a cincinnatian you dont do something like this without having a lot of different feelings
72605 as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position
72606 j ts not back in it hes been in it this quarterback position is open whoever gives us the best chance to win is the guy
72607 i think right now its just organized chaos and theyre just trying to learn all this stuff
72608 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
72609 im strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say a month from now im going to be ready its about me doing my job as well as i can it doesnt change if im in the first group or the fifth group
72610 i feel fine its just noticeably tired coaches felt like i needed a rest so thats what we did its kind of normal for this time of year were ready to go now
72611 i see a guy thats bounced around the league a little bit but theres no question to me that j t osullivan is tough hes competitive and hes resilient
72612 now if he can play quarterback that would be great
72613 we tried to move both of them that was our preference when we got to the deadline today and just didnt have any interest we felt it was better to deal with it this way
72614 i apologize to the organization and the fans im a better baseball player than i played

72664 in the first case a 39 year old female taking 50mg a day of vitamin b6 for three months developed a feeling of burning pain and
72665 she was also taking a multivitamin product containing vitamin b6 and therefore her total daily dose most likely exceeded the upper level of intake of 50mg a day recommended by national guidelines

72730 ive seen it at least three times and i only drive four miles to work
72731 the final bottom line is if youre distracted from the task at hand your risk rises
72732 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
72733 no one will be immune from its catastrophic consequences the whole of sudan and the entire region
72734 what you are saying is that you will do what you want regardless mid suffolk district council will ride roughshod over people and do what they want
72735 we do not want rumours we want to be as open as possible about it and have found that generally people have been very supportive
72736 we do not want to see a campaign to save the church because of a lack of understanding the church can be found a new home this is a huge building and we could find somewhere better for their needs
72737 if the church carries on here ultimately they will reach a crisis point in the future and could not sell that building it is not something others would want ultimately everyone will come out of this better
72738 this stretch of properties lets the town down it is a 1950s and 1960s block which is really unattractive suffolk homes
72739 theres a definite level of betrayal of you done us wrong by marginalizing us
72740 then the bare ankle migrated from country club saturdays to meeting room mondays and suddenly men whether shod in wingtips or loafers were widely seen without socks now it appears that after some stops and starts in recent seasons the men of the white collar work force are marching into the office in shorts

72752 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
72753 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
72754 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
72755 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
72756 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
72757 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
72758 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
72759 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
72760 overall inflation remains robust even though a price increase in utilities accounted for almost half of the total monthly increase

72767 lets wrap some lard around that and paint the god damn statistics with piss
72768 what do you mean you cant come in what are you sick from
72769 dont ask questions you dont want to hear the answers to
72770 talk about their ex boyfriends wang and how big it was
72771 an image a day and an mp3 to go with it for no obvious reason
72772 effectively the department is saying that a primary care trust should be able to say to a dentist your contract will come to an end tomorrow just because we feel like it
72773 every right minded person can see that this is totally unreasonable and would destroy the viability of family dental practices
72774 a success for the department of health would be bad for dentists bad for patients and disastrous for the health of the nation
72775 even the pope is elected by his peers but what the anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
72776 their cultures are mostly closed authoritarian and patriarchal while muslim men of all ages can be genuinely friendly to strangers theirs is a culture of boasting and quick tempers but when one engages them individually especially younger men in polite discussions of politics and history the mask falls and there is much sorrow expressed over how greatly the muslim world has degenerated into a pathetic shadow of its past what is privately admitted cannot be publicly affirmed or discussed

72779 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
72780 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
72781 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
72782 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
72783 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
72784 t he state of a female after conception and until the termination of the gestation
72785 the condition of having a developing embryo or fetus in the body after union of an oocyte and spermatozoon
72786 i know your post had some thoughtful disclaimers but please be careful when as a scientist you comment on breaking news issues in other areas of science no sense returning the favor with an evolutionary biologist muddying the waters of biochemistry and forensic drug testing
72787 oh well even scientists are confused by the test results i guess we shouldnt worry about them
72788 if the drug was being abused for its anabolic properties she most likely wouldnt be taking it during competition
72789 we used thg an anabolic steroid immediately after the competition because of the exertion and the micro tears you need to facilitate healing and recovery
72790 if she was taking it for the short term respiratory effects she should have pinged the test on the 6th as well
72791 id also like to point out that assuming that the test for clenbuterol is prone to massive 66 false negatives would seem to cast a great deal of doubt on the clinical testing procedures you know the ones you were concerned that i was casting doubt on by asking questions in the first place
72792 the series of results still seems strange particularly if the explanation for the presence of the drug in hardy is intentional substance abuse
72793 logmein is among a handful of companies offering commercialized alternatives to the open source vnc package virtual network computer aimed at remote troubleshooting and support applications the main upgrade compared to just using vnc is that logmein uses port 80 vncs well known port is 5900 allowing it to pass through most corporate firewalls

72795 ze is gek op gespierde kerels en hij ziet er afgetraind uit van toen hij in het isra lisch leger diende hij heeft enkele tatoeages en die vindt zij ook te gek ze hebben zoveel tijd samen doorgebracht dat van het een het ander kwam en er een fysieke relatie ontstond
72796 hij haalde twee oude dametjes in een kleine fiat in het volgende dat ik me herinner is dat ik plat op mijn gezicht lag na de aanrijding
72797 daarna reed hij weg zonder me een blik waardig te gunnen hij heeft zich niet verontschuldigd ik vond hem arrogant

72800 ieder jaar in december wordt de nieuwe dienstregeling ingevoerd op basis van de cijfers van overbezetting en de vraag wordt dan beslist of er extra rijtuigen of dubbeldekkers worden ingezet we moeten ook zien of er rijpaden vrij zijn want niet alleen vanuit hasselt is er vraag om meer treinen in te leggen
72801 we zitten daar op de maximumcapaciteit van 92 treinen per uur
72802 laat gewoon de trein hasselt diest aarschot om het uur direct naar brussel sporen zonder stop in leuven dus de directe trein maastricht luik brussel kan gerust in leuven stoppen zodat leuven geen trein verliest naar brussel op de trein maastricht luik brussel zit toch geen hond en luik heeft per uur al vier tot vijf vlotte verbindingen met brussel de directe trein maastricht luik brussel rijdt meestal zo goed als leeg het is gewoon een prestigeproject waar limburg en het hageland slachtoffer van zijn

72810 if you think youre too small to make a difference youve never been in bed with a mosquito
72811 when you are inspired by some great purpose some extraordinary project all your thoughts break their bounds
72812 it is no charity scheme to make the project viable we would subsidise the low cost housing by selling the commercial component at a market rate of rs 3 000 a sq ft
72813 only affordability is an issue if there is a township which offers affordable housing and social amenities they will not mind travelling one and a half hour to a home where which does not have cramped interiors but a separate living and a bed room
72814 i wish to show that it is possible to construct affordable housing by using innovative construction technology that minimises skilled inputs and delivers results at affordable rates flats would be ready for occupation within 90 to 120 days
72815 we would further sell the flats only on lottery and not allotment to prevent speculators from entering the market

72819 some of it is within the precincts of the factory site
72820 as such giving back such land to their owners would lead to scrapping of the project
72821 a complete guide to adventureland tomorrowland fantasyland frontierland amp main street usa

72831 now i really do believe you turned her down it must be a weird place this new eden of yours ill just have to remember that keeping my temper with you is going to be hard but worth it just to get up her nose look its a big privilege for a man to be allowed touch a woman in the street you should walk a little behind me
72832 now take my hand at least look im not going to bite you i just want to make the old bat turn green she made me look like a fool in that hearing
72833 the path to redemption lies in forgiveness it is better to forgive than to seek revenge
72834 good so were giving old judge garanet a change to take the path to redemption isnt that kind of us now walk and try not to look like you think im going to bite you i wont not yet anyway
72835 you really dont know anything do you ill have to try to remember that this bit

72837 hello yes mrs piazza theyre out theyre out of basel theyre okay really all right not hurt or anything youre sure just a minute
72838 theyre out of basel oma and mrs simpson and the archduchess theyre okay absolutely okay henry can you come to the phone
72839 dont go away hes coming right now thea had to get his cane for him
72840 isnt that a hoot mary simpson and the archduchess getting into a plane with the new king in the netherlands so jesse wood could fly them off to amsterdam
72841 ive never flown i bet i would have by now if the ring of fire hadnt happened maybe we still can someday
72842 i can see it now we get so famous that a plane lands out in your dads storage lot to take us someplace exciting not likely just not how about checking my algebra homework before we leave for school
72843 shell be on her way home by the end of the week they tell me horns sending her by boat as soon as he can arrange to get her on one with all the necessary safe conducts and such for passing through the region held by bernhard of saxe weimar down the rhine and then up the main
72844 so henry are you going to climb into that atv to make the tour of the towns in buchenland before the snow flies
72845 we got a new message in from fulda right before i left the office
72846 theyre suggesting that since veronica will be landing at frankfurt you ought to extend the tour go on down the kinzigtal and meet her there there are bits and pieces of buchenland county along the route until you get as far as hanau
72847 not a bad idea its a pretty trip not a very good road but a really pretty trip especially in the fall when the leaves are turning i go that road all the time the
72848 maybe they should have waited and not had last months parade until they got mrs simpson and mrs dreeson back that would have made for a few more floats
72849 most of the guys are going to end up just as drunk tonight as they did after the parade first they strut and then they swill its not as if any of them here had anything to do with what was going on in basel but to hear them talk youd think that the sotf reserves rode into the city with don fernando the king in the netherlands whatever hes called at the moment and raised the siege at the embassy
72850 maybe we should go home early its not as if theres anyone here were interested in and were not close enough to dad and mayor dreeson to overhear anything political
72851 no not really i just spotted one of velmas less pleasant old boyfriends over there take a sighting past wackernagel then a little to the left and four tables toward the door i dont want to walk past him is there enough room anywhere that we could get out one of the other doors
72852 he didnt but not for lack of trying talk about a nasty nasty man fish bait
72853 maybe youd better let daddy give you some lessons in dirty fighting you ought to see what mom can do
72854 his sister bettys husband seems to be a good man too but hes been so sick ever since we came to grantville that its hard to tell what hed be like if he wasnt coughing all the time betty likes him though her son davids nice and so is louises husband but theyre both about fifty i guess how do you tell if someone young is going to turn out to be a good man
72855 reputation i guess pay attention to what other girls say sometimes it does pay to listen to gossip
72856 listen to what the guys say oh sure men say they dont gossip they do though they just call it shooting the breeze there were a bunch out in daddys welding shop the other day older guys not our age but its all the same one of them asked who did bobby fitz marry anyway thats what they called austin omearas brother it wasnt his name but everyone called him that i dont know why none of you probably ever met him since he moved away a dozen or so years before the ring of fire but you remember austin the one who got killed in a fight here at the gardens last year well first one of them said it was obie conways sister down in kentucky and then they started talking about the job corps and when bobby fitz met her and how her folks interfered and she married someone from her dads snake handler church instead but after he died obie dropped a word to bobby fitz and he gave notice at his job that same afternoon and headed for pikeville with everything he owned in his pickup
72857 there wasnt a one of them who doubted that when bobby fitz tore out of town he had a respectable marriage on his mind even if it did come with three half grown stepsons attached or that hed be good to sandy jo and her kids theres a lot to be said for listening to guys who work with a man they know how he acts if its one of those days that started by dropping an anvil on his big toe and ended by having a big weld go wrong at the last minute
72858 yeah maybe but busters friends are old enough to tell the difference i dont think guys our age really are
72859 my advice is that you dont even try to tell the difference now just hold back for a while im not planning to get serious for another ten years at least not until ive finished all my education and worked for a while maybe not until ive traveled some if things settle down
72860 i dont need that kind of complication in my life right now
72861 with a program like this thats what is going to be the goal every year to win states and to win fciacs it is going to take a lot of hard work but we believe that we have the potential to go all the way
72862 we definitely have a lot of new girls coming into the program but they all have some wonderful talent to bring in so we are excited about that
72863 we have a strong group returning on both sides of the field the new talent that has come is playing well and adapting very well with the experienced players
72864 i am real excited about coaching the team and the girls are extremely excited about the season
72865 they are real intent on learning and really want to win they have worked beautifully together and are so supportive of one another to walk into a situation like is a privilege
72866 the transition to the new coaching staff has been great
72867 they are very good at communicating with us and trust us to step up to the plate
72868 we have a lot of depth in our attack a lot of players can score goals for us
72869 she was the junior varsity goalie last year and has really impressed so far in practice
72870 i would say that we have a quick team in attack and in the midfield and our core group of defenders down low are pretty strong
72871 it will be nice if we could hold the other team from scoring and be patient on attack and get the goals that we need then we will be tough to beat
72872 i want to make sure we are all on the same page as far as basic skills go
72873 i am looking for discipline on the field and doing physically the right thing at the right time and responding to a situation the right way
72874 we definitely had some amazing players graduate but we have some key players returning and our younger players have looked great
72875 everyone has really improved so much since we began practice
72876 darien wilton and new canaan are always big rivals of ours and we have a friendly rivalry with ga
72877 ive been unable to make or receive calls on my mobile all morning
72878 after a 50 minute wait listening to the optus telephone on hold rubbish i was told by someone that service will be affecting quite a lot of melbournians at least till sic midday
72879 i am in sydney cbd and have not been able to do anything pretty much since this morning the network keeps coming on and off and when i have tried to sms or call it goes straight to no service
72880 sentiment is more focused on slowing demand rather than short term supply disruptions
72881 there is no breach of the hull no water getting in and no signs of any pollution
72882 is that ansten is aware of how shorthanded we are how shorthanded all of us are and of course
72883 hes also got enough sheer bullheaded stubbornness for any three people i could think of right off hand
72884 should i take that as an indication that you dont want me handing the job back over to him this afternoon sir
72885 frankly nothing would please me more than to have you hand it over to him
72886 believe me ginger i know youve got plenty to do down in engineering without adding this to the load but im not prepared to put ansten back into harness quite yet whatever he thinks
72887 i cant pretend i wouldnt rather go back to engineering full time
72888 but i agree with you where ansten is concerned do you want me to break it gently to him sir or will you tell him yourself
72889 the cowardly part of me wants to leave it to you unfortunately i believe they told me at saganami island that there were certain responsibilities a commanding officer wasnt allowed to shuffle off on to a subordinate i suspect facing ansten under these circumstances qualifies
72890 theyve repeated their demand that we evacuate the system immediately right on schedule but thats about all so far
72891 nothing more about that medical necessity civilian evacuation of eroica they trotted out yesterday
72892 no sir or not yet at least after all the days still young in estelle
72893 do you think theres any truth to tylers medical emergency claims sir
72894 i wont completely rule out the possibility if it is a genuine emergency though its a very conveniently
72895 the only thing that struck me as just a bit odd about it is that hes waited this long to trot it out
72896 well hes already used the running out of food argument and the life support emergency claim and the damaged power systems claim ginger
72897 that old fairytale about the boy that cried wolf comes to mind now
72898 on the other hand this one is a bit different in that we cant verify or disprove his claims as easily as we did the others
72899 i think were going to have to arrange an examination of some of these conveniently sick monicans
72900 which probably means its a good thing lajos is just about fit for duty again
72901 sir with all due respect im not sure offering the monicans hostages of their own is the best move
72902 im not about to send lieutenant sarkozy or lajos aboard eroica station if theyre prepared to put some of their deathly ill patients aboard a shuttle and send it out to us well examine them here and if they arent willing to ill take that as evidence they know wed see through their bogus claims
72903 in the meantime whats the latest from commander lignos about
72904 its not anything the yard dogs back home would be ready to sign off on but by swapping out those components with photo album
72905 wow im a freaking genius im saving a small fortune on groceries by eating every last scrap in the fridge before running down to king soopers and dropping two benjamins on a boatload of generic everything
72906 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
72907 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
72908 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
72909 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
72910 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72911 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

72915 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72916 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72917 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72918 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72919 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72920 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
72921 and finally my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and who made all this possible in the first place mr jack warner
72922 once events have downloaded theyll be there to view anytime anywhere online or off
72923 now doc i can take it tell me in plain english what the hells wrong with me
72924 you crazy woman this weather is perfect what on earth are you always moaning about
72925 oooh its so big look at how yellow it is good grief theres a lot of flesh on that
72926 and i wasnt joking because i then proceeded to forget to include her divine entry in the roundup
72927 im just sorry that something like this had to happen to me especially again
72928 because i really look at myself as being a person that has high integrity and high character and ive worked a lot of years to get to that
72929 to have these types of errors in judgment is something thats not part of my character its something im deeply sorry about
72930 im sorry that i put myself my family and also the seahawks organization in this type of situation
72931 i also thank them for their caring their concern and their patience in this whole thing not jumping to judgments but really going through a full investigative process to find out everything that was going on
72932 because sometimes when you go through this thing you start hearing a lot about it and you start talking a lot about it you start wondering whether you do have a problem or not
72933 you never know thats something that i had to try and make sure and get professionals to make sure of that for me
72934 its been one of the toughest things ive had to deal with only because theres a perception out there that i have a problem theres a perception out there that i got two duis theres a perception out there that im some out of control drunk driving around the streets of seattle
72935 i know how they want to operate here they dont want those type of embarrassing distractions
72936 they want good quality people to work here but they also understand that people can make mistakes everybodys not perfect and i think they took that into consideration with me
72937 im the one who put myself in this situation i have to deal with it ive dealt with tough situations before in my life and ill deal with this one as well
72938 i knew there was a lot of transition planned but i didnt know all the things would transpire like they did
72939 i knew i had big shoes to fill because stump is a wonderful coach and hes done great things with the backs here for years
72940 first of all stumps more intense hes not going to give you too many smiles and you could hear him from a mile away calling my name leonard
72941 kasey on the other hand is very energetic on the field in some of these drills hes running down the field with us hes very hands on so its been a good change
72942 he was real competitive could catch anything and was very bright
72943 the guy liked playing and his teammates liked him and he learned all that stuff
72944 for some guys practice is a chore especially this time of year in training camp kasey didnt survive he excelled
72945 but as former uw defensive coordinator tom tipps once said when i told him that same thing dont blame this b
72946 it was never really something i set myself up to go do
72947 oh happy day oh hap py da a a ay
72948 i was back there singing a gospel song and he was like leonard stop it
72949 i go to church and i love to hear hymns
72950 leonard is as talented a fullback as ive ever had
72951 and really the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful every play is leonard
72952 hes strong enough hes fast enough he has great skill he has become a very good blocker hes the strongest blocker among the backs we have now
72953 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
72954 i could bet a lot of money that didnt come from the pitcher thats something they can deal with
72955 i had 112 pitches one start before too but i think i was a little more efficient here today
72956 we have to watch him but every game he has pitched he has given us a chance to win
72957 look chicago isnt very far from milwaukee and its an easy drive
72958 but there were a lot of brewers fans here its wonderful the attendance for these four games here they filled out the ballpark for these four games and outside of the fact they lost the four ballgames they have to be happy with the support theyre getting you cant ask for more than four sellouts
72959 youd like to wash my fresh mouth out shove in a big bar of soap but you know that i always swallow i let it slide down my throat
72960 he would have had blue eyes im sure he would have made you love me more
72961 there are several false beliefs prevalent in our society regarding solar eclipse some people even lock themselves in their homes to avoid the bad rays from the eclipse
72962 i have been told that during an eclipse the number of germs increases therefore no food is eaten or cooked during the event and any food cooked before the eclipse is discarded
72963 solar eclipse is an interesting activity and should be watched under the supervision of experts with proper gadgets
72964 it is very important to emphasise that viewing the eclipse with naked eyes would be very dangerous for the eyes viewing the sun through a telescope or a binoculars without a proper filter is many times more dangerous do not ever do that it could destroy your eyesight
72965 by projection method a pinhole or small opening is used to cast the image of the sun on a screen placed a half meter or more beyond the opening
72966 if clouds permit a pinhole placed at the crosswires of the jai prakas instrument of the jantar mantar observatory would be used to trace the entire progress of the eclipse in the bowl of the instrument

72973 even if you think youre going to do something and scotty said i like it youd feel better about making the move with his experience and knowledge
72974 hes going to be a tremendous help to dale he really was the guy who taught our players and demanded our players take it to another level im going to miss him professionally and personally he has passion energy and hes fun to be around
72975 i dont know it was wrapped up today so i didnt feel anything well probably try to throw without the padding tomorrow and see how it feels
72976 this is the darndest thing ive ever seen as far as a skin problem

72979 it aint a big deal he got hurt if he wanted to pitch through it im sure he could have but hes doing the smart thing

72988 while the demographics of iphone users are very similar to all smartphone owners the iphone is outpacing other smartphones in driving mobile content consumption by a significant margin
72989 in addition to the attributes of the device itself another important factor to consider is the fact that all iphones on at amp t are attached to an unlimited data plan our data shows that once the fear of surprise data charges is eliminated mobile content consumption increases dramatically regardless of device
72990 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
72991 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system

72996 substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
72997 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
72998 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
72999 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it

73005 the weak dollar and rebates kept the economy shuffling along
73006 we had more than 1 1 percent inflation which means that economic growth was much lower

73046 monsters do exist in us and among us they walk in our shadow they can prey on us more as we fear them less we should know we created them
73047 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
73048 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
73049 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
73050 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
73051 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
73052 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
73053 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
73054 they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
73055 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law
73056 the horrific nature of it is probably one of a kind in canadian history

73063 today company web sites are being shaped by markets desire for highly current and interactive information
73064 we recognize that allowing companies to present data in formats different from those dictated by our forms or more technologically advanced than edgar can be especially helpful to investors

73067 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
73068 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
73069 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
73070 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

73083 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
73084 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

73242 weve never done anything like this before and its nice to be able to put on something a bit different for people of all ages to enjoy this summer
73243 we could sell far more than were actually able to get hold of and because its so popular we have to keep it under the counter with a notice to tell customers that they can only have one jar each
73244 we sold hundreds of jars in the first couple of weeks when we started getting it but now they are limiting us to 18 jars a week and i could sell all that within an hour of getting it
73245 its lovely stuff to taste but a lot of people want it because its hayfever season and honey made from pollen of local flowers is meant to help the immune system
73246 it is great stuff and so popular i could sell several times the amount we are able to get
73247 the offender gained entry through an insecure window and our inquiries are ongoing
73248 the burglary occurred at a locked office at stepping hill hospital
73249 the trust believes it has captured images of the perpetrator on its system
73250 it has reported the theft to greater manchester police who are investigating
73251 amongst the items stolen was a laptop computer used for scheduling appointments which held some patient information
73252 this information was held on a secure system with three levels of password protection the trust believes it is unlikely that anyone would be able to access this data
73253 despite this low level of risk the trust has written to 1 581 patients who attended the clinic to inform them of the incident
73254 it has also set up a 24 hour telephone hotline to give assurance to any individuals who might be concerned

73264 more than 28m could be saved on statin prescribing across the north west and used to improve other aspects of care
73265 the use of generic prescribing for statins can substantially reduce the cost of providing patient care to those diagnosed and at high risk and the evidence is that these are suitable for the majority of patients
73266 the gain from generic prescribing could be used by pcts to reach more patients and provide incentives for quality care management
73267 some patients experience muscle aches and others suffer liver problems with the cheaper generic drugs
73268 asda believes it is time that pricing structures which increase with age should be challenged and that parents of older or larger children should not be penalised in this way
73269 the average family spends more than 320 a year on uniforms for up to 12 year olds
73270 with the flat rate from george spending on uniforms could be as low as 32 a year

73280 in my mind mr newman made a stupid and inappropriate comment and perhaps in the future he will be more careful about what he chooses to say
73281 i have received numerous emails today expressing disgust at what mr newman said and i would point out that many of these have been sent by men concerned at the nature of the comments
73282 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
73283 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the program given the news of tasmanias backing
73284 sam qualified this moments later when he realised hed been taken out of context
73285 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment
73286 i think it was a slip i understood what he said i didnt take the double meaning in it i understand why people might
73287 i know james brayshaw did and he took it up with sam
73288 im starting to really in some ways sort of question if everything sam said is going to be scrutinised and analysed i think we are going to start becoming terribly unfair
73289 he went out of his way to say that he didnt say that and i think youve got to take him on face value

73315 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
73316 this is an action with the federal government which is sad

73322 driving across idaho and nevada we saw normal condensation trails in the skies above north idaho and we were habitually looking up as we drove toward las vegas we had noticed that the sparsely populated areas in nevada had brilliantly clear blue skies and that the occasional airplane left vapor trails that dissipated normally but as soon as we neared las vegas in the skies directly above the city we watched what appeared to be a military c 135 transports spraying something over the populated areas when the planes were no longer directly over las vegas they continued flying leaving a vapor trail that dissipated normally
73323 mainstream newspapers have gone out of their way to dismiss these eyewitness accounts

73329 it was these unmarked planes that were constantly laying down the criss crossing x patterns of lingering chemical spray trails over southern nevada
73330 i first began to notice the chemtrails in late 96 14 criss crossed miles long vapor trails that didnt evaporate like the norm i began to see them weekly then daily
73331 it covered my car with a sticky web like coating and i saved a specimen in a jar microscopic fiber like filaments
73332 had been rewrittenand the references to chemtrails and the other types of weapons were quietly eliminated
73333 accusing the air force of being involved in spraying the u s population
73334 several authors cite an air university research paper titled weather as a force multiplier owning the weather in 2025 that suggests the air force is conducting weather modification experiments the purpose of that paper was part of a thesis to outline a strategy for the use of a future weather modification system to achieve military objectives and it does not reflect current military policy practice or capability the air force is not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future the chemtrail hoax has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities scientific organizations and major media publications
73335 the term chemtrail is a hoax that began circulating approximately three years ago which asserts the government is involved in a joint federal program of covert spraying of the public
73336 weather is a force multiplier owning the weather in 2025
73337 general weakness vomiting diarrhea chest pains coughing and shortness of breath upper respiratory tract irritation
73338 deterioration of the heart liver and kidneys and hemorrhages in the respiratory tract
73339 ethylene dibromide is a carcinogen and must be handled with extreme caution
73340 exposure can irritate the lungs repeated exposure may cause bronchitis development of cough and shortness of breath it will damage the liver and kidneys
73341 seem to have more colds more bronchitis more chronic coughs than the people not exposed to jet fuel
73342 flying and dispersing over the city it was supposed to be a clear sunny day it became more overcast as the day progressed i observed how the white trails widened out and settled down creating a haze over everything
73343 accusing the air force of being involved in spraying the u s population
73344 the chemtrail hoax has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities scientific organizations and major media publications
73345 the trails turn on and off like old time sky writers and crop dusters they are a controlled spray typically ended with precision as the trails reach the edge of the populated areas
73346 it covered my car with a sticky web like coating and i saved a specimen in a jar microscopic fiber like filaments
73347 usually fall in clumps or wads ranging from pencil eraser size to the size of a balled up fist
73348 fairly certain the chemtrail phenomena is one part of a military weather modification and weapons system
73349 the huge xs being traced by formations of tanker jets in the sky can be tracked by satellite and coordinated with electro magnetic beams to heat the upper atmosphere changing its temperature and density and enhancing weather effects theorizes farmer referring to the governments haarp project
73350 altering the upper atmosphere wind patterns using plumes of atmospheric particles as a lens or focusing device
73351 i had looked at using this intense beam which can be angled to do some experiments in terms of guiding the jetstream moving it from one spot to another i presume it is possible which might lend credence to these other things
73352 in the united states weather modification will likely become a part of national security policy with both domestic and international applications
73353 the necessary sensor and communication capabilities to observe detect and act on weather modification requirements to support u s military objectives
73354 the haarp facility will not affect the weather transmitted energy in the frequency ranges that will be used by haarp is subject to negligible absorption in either the troposphere or the stratosphere the two levels of the atmosphere that produce the earths weather electromagnetic interactions only occur in the near vacuum of the rarefied region above about 70 km known as the ionosphere
73355 very linearly so that they will not produce radio interference to other users of the radio spectrum
73356 i believe the chemtrails are responsible for a chemical intoxication of the public which would then cause a general immune suppression low grade to high grade depending on exposure an immune dysfunction which would then allow people to become susceptible to opportunistic infections
73357 theres no question that its real i first began to investigate chemtrails when some were sprayed over my home in northern idaho i took pictures of them and then contacted the environmental protection agency of the state when i contacted their directors they were clueless and referred me to the air force they then got me in touch with centers for disease control toxicology and after about a week i received a letter from one of their chief toxicologists saying indeed there was some amount of ethylene dibromide in the jet fuel

73360 whatever this material is it cannot be good for us moreover it represents another example of americans taking their liberty and well being for granted it may be that weather agencies nasa and national oceanic amp atmospheric administration know enough to keep their mouths shut
73361 the overall scope and agenda behind chemtrails operation clover leaf operation red sky operation rain dance the code names for these ops intertwines several overall objectives deemed imperative by the real power in dc which is the national security administration it should be noted that most of the intel groups that are involved in domestic control are in varying degrees in the loop on this business and are actively working with the office of naval intelligence and the nsa in seeing this program succeed

73363 today marks the beginning of a new era for piper aircraft as the company literally takes flight into a whole new realm of performance luxury and capability
73364 with this major milestone in the piperjets development we are witnessing our future one that is built on a strong and lasting heritage and reputation for innovation and excellence
73365 the piperjet exhibited excellent control response around all three axes
73366 the ergonomics and the basic operation of the side stick control were excellent with well balanced and harmonized control inputs required for the air speeds that we tested moreover the expected level of pitch trim change with power applications was minimal and easy to overcome
73367 the fadec control on the williams engine greatly reduces pilot workload allowing greater focus on controlling and navigating the piperjet
73368 pushing the single power level full forward for takeoff results in a smooth but rapid buildup of thrust and acceleration
73369 the resulting lack of cabin noise was even better than expected
73370 even without sound insulation or an interior the cabin was exceptionally quiet it will be even quieter in the completed airplane in all our customers should be very pleased with the quiet cabin and lack of engine vibration
73371 the piperjet will be certified in the normal category under faa part 23 and applicable foreign certification standards
73372 its designed to be flown by a single pilot and will be rvsm certified moreover its innovative design includes ample baggage space and class setting useful load the piperjet will be certified to a maximum operating altitude of 35 000 feet well above the weather while combining performance with the latest safety technologies and features
73373 as you know weve got a proposed policy change for homebuilts
73374 its come to our attention that some companies may be skirting the letter of the law by selling a kit that requires nothing more than two turns of a screwdriver
73375 when we say that 51 percent of the plane has to be put together by the builder and not the kit maker we mean it
73376 in my opinion 51 percent is appropriate the aim here of the policy change isnt to punish its for your safety and for the integrity of the system
73377 weve noticed a disturbing trend lately with amateur builts accidents and fatal accidents are increasing both in absolute numbers and in rates
73378 in fact the fatal accident rate for this segment is three times as high as personal use ga
73379 weve got an active partnership with tom poberezny eaa president and his staff to try and bring these numbers down
73380 the general aviation joint steering committee has formed a new subcommittee for amateur built aircraft safety earl lawrence from eaa is co chairing it along with john duncan of flight standards

73393 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times

73429 with xdna x rite is giving automakers and their suppliers the appropriate tool to distinguish characteristics of effect paints that cant be detected much less analyzed by other systems
73430 we coined the term xdna to emphasize the fact that each effect paint has a unique three dimensional mathematical model similar to the way that each person has a unique dna structure the exact name for package is dynamic numerical analysis but we figured xdna was a little easier to say
73431 x rite will first market the xdna system with ma98 to the automakers and automotive suppliers in the united states and europe but the package has potential applications in other industries including appliance manufacturing and cosmetics formulation
73432 the xdna system of software with ma98 is available in most languages

73436 in the second quarter solid revenue growth across our product categories led to our strong financial performance
73437 we have revised upward our 2008 financial guidance to reflect strong second quarter results as well as positive trends in our critical care and anesthetic analgesic products
73438 our overall performance in the second quarter was in line with our expectations as we continued to make progress in each of our three operating divisions our efforts to improve the quality of our services and better retain and develop our employees continued to result in strong volume and revenue growth as well as further improvements in professional liability workers compensation and employee health costs
73439 our hospital revenue growth of 7 was driven by 7 growth in overall admissions as well as 6 growth in same store admissions solid growth in non government admissions and steady payment rates in this category also contributed to our hospital top line growth excluding the favorable prior year medicaid cost report settlement our nursing center revenues grew 7 and operating income grew 11 in the second quarter compared to the same period last year as a result of higher patient volumes improved quality mix lower employee turnover and improved operating efficiencies peoplefirst rehabilitation services reported another solid quarter with revenues increasing 25 and operating income growing 12 compared to the second quarter last year
73440 notwithstanding our good overall results for the quarter our hospital results were softer than we expected due primarily to cost management issues and shortfalls in some of our newer facilities in the second half of the year we believe that we can improve our performance in these areas
73441 we are continuing to develop seven additional hospitals that will open over the next couple of years and we are reviewing other acquisitions and development opportunities in each of our operating divisions
73442 we look forward to continued progress in each of our operating divisions as we focus on the execution of our strategic operating plan as in the past we expect some seasonal weakness in the third quarter particularly in our hospital business followed by stronger fourth quarter performance

73458 buyers will be stunned at how well this home lives like a detached single family home
73459 we are pleased that the alj has determined that there was no violation of section 337 todays ruling maintains continued competition in the marketplace which will benefit american consumers during this time of rising food prices
73460 our second quarter results positively reflect our credit and expense control strategies and the fundamental earning power of the company showing our ability to absorb significant increases in our loan loss reserve and still record income for the first six months of the year absent our substantial loan loss provision the companys second quarter earnings would have surpassed 2007 levels
73461 the economic downturn that began to affect our markets and customers in 2007 has continued into the first half of this year it is likely to present additional challenges for the rest of this year and may extend into 2009 the high growth areas in which we do business have borne the brunt of the collapsing real estate prices there is a domino reaction with slowing employment and the declining wealth effect has created anxiety far beyond our borders we believe these economic factors may continue to constrain loan and deposit growth 1031 real estate transactions and the northern california and northern nevada markets for the foreseeable future along with this climate of uncertainty recent bank closures may also have a detrimental effect on deposit growth as customers move their deposits to multiple banks to ensure full fdic coverage
73462 we continue to experience slower growth in our nevada and california markets pressure on asset portfolio yields and the net interest margin and strains on credit quality our allowance for loan losses at 1 57 of outstanding loans evidences our aggressive recognition of problem credits with the uncertainties of the current economy growth has taken a back seat to tighter management controls of our operations and stricter underwriting standards remote deposit sales activities and enhanced online banking products are advancing our efforts for greater core deposit growth during 2008 however these efforts may just stem the tide of reduced individual core deposits as a result of the downturn in the national economy
73463 we continue to re evaluate our expectations for 2008 based on credit market uncertainties declining real estate valuations loan loss reserve provisions and interest rate conditions we remain cautiously optimistic for 2008
73464 executing our sales and operational initiatives enabled us to make progress on many fronts during the quarter despite continued soft economic conditions
73465 sales growth rates improved sequentially from the first quarter across most product categories and were boosted by a strong contribution from the ors nasco acquisition margins decreased reflecting lower sales of high margin discretionary products within categories reduced product cost inflation and significantly higher fuel costs we have taken actions to offset the effects of the economic slowdown including growth initiatives margin improvement actions and further cost reductions while continuing to invest in key strategic initiatives further gains in working capital efficiency contributed to strong cash flow results
73466 we are committed to helping third party software companies provide our office products dealers with superior technology platforms which include e commerce and backoffice solutions to help them meet their customers needs
73467 to facilitate this united has invested in electronic catalog technology digital content and third party software solutions including rts due to delays in bringing rts to market and the acceleration of the development of other software solutions we took a charge related to capitalized costs for our portion of rts despite this charge we are encouraged by the recent progress of rts as well as other software solutions which will utilize our new electronic catalog technology and superior digital content to provide end consumers with the excellent shopping experience they desire
73468 our inventory management teams have achieved turnover improvements while delivering the exceptional service our customers expect this enabled us to produce strong cash flow and maintain a solid financial position with debt at targeted levels we have confidence in our cash flow outlook for the year and will continue to take a measured approach in using our cash flow for priority capital projects investment buys acquisitions and share repurchases while maintaining our strong capital structure

73472 at this stage would refrain because i just believe that at this point really metals future is so insecure so one would ignore it at this stage over the long term like i said one would want to wait and just see how the demand increases and exactly what happens to consumption and only if one sees that in the medium term to the long term that there is a definite trend where there is increase in demand and it is not going to fall off would one want to look at the metal sector at this point of time
73473 cairn india cil has recorded healthy growth during the april june quarter riding on the global rise in crude oil prices net revenues increased 66 yoy to rs 4 billion while net profit stood at rs 1 4 billion against a loss of rs 714 million in q2cy07 slightly above our expectations however the ebitda margin declined significantly qoq due to higher drilling activities which inflated exploration costs the companys average oil price realisation increased to usd 126 bbl in q2cy08 from usd 70 bbl in q2cy07 while gas price realisation remained flat at usd 4 3 mscf the management expects production from its ravva and cambay basins to decline during the next two quarters to an average of 16 000 17 000boepd further exploration expenses would remain on the higher side which would constrain margins we are revising our estimates for cy08 to incorporate a crude price realisation of usd 120 bbl from usd 90 bbl earlier however we maintain our projection of usd 90 bbl for subsequent years further we are raising our cost of equity to 14 7 from 12 7 which has caused wacc to move from 12 to 13 8 consequently our target price reduces to rs 305 from rs 314 we maintain a buy recommendation on the stock
73474 tata steel is making some kind of a base formation probably because of the good news flow that finally seems to be coming in i dont think it is going to outperform or go away from what the markets will broadly do so rs 600 is also a level below which i would say okay if you have a long position than one needs to get out of it if the stock breaks that within those parameters it is possible to buy on a dip even make a trading call and say okay i will sell out on whatever little rally that comes in
73475 siemens has a much better chart inspite of all the ups and downs that it has seen in the last 6 months the suggestion is that this may be the last leg of a downtrend we are seeing if you are an investor you might like to go and buy the stock for traders it is nothing you can do if the market falls

73500 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in the strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative the constitution of the u s forbids everything like an establishment of a national religion the law appointing chaplains establishes a religious worship for the national representatives to be performed by ministers of religion elected by a majority of them and these are to be paid out of the national taxes does not this involve the principle of a national establishment applicable to a provision for a religious worship for the constituent as well as of the representative body approved by the majority and conducted by ministers of religion paid by the entire nation
73501 while he expressed that opinion with respect to the freedom of speech provision of the amendment there is no logical reason for reading the freedom of religion provisions any differently furthermore nothing which happened
73502 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
73503 believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his god that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only and not opinions i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
73504 congress should not establish a religion and enforce the legal observation of it by law nor compel men to worship god in any manner contrary to their conscience or that one sect might obtain a pre eminence or two combined together and establish a religion to which they would compel others to conform
73505 strongly guarded as is the separation between religion amp govt in the constitution of the united states the danger of encroachment by ecclesiastical bodies may be illustrated by precedents already furnished in their short history

73510 so to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
73511 for i have sworn before you and almighty god the same solemn oath to uphold the constitution our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago the world is very different now and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god
73512 done in convention by the unanimous consent of the states present the seventeenth day of september in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven and of the independence of the united states of america the twelfth
73513 secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity
73514 it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides over council of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained a reference to the laws of nature and natures god and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered perhaps as deeply as finally staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the american people
73515 of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish them a volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity let it simply be asked where is the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
73516 religion or the duty which we owe to our creator and the manner of discharging it can only be dictated by reason and conviction and the conscience of every man this right is in its nature an unalienable right it is the duty of every man to render to the creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him
73517 whereas almighty god hath created the mind free that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our blessed religion who being lord of both body and mind yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either as was in his almighty power to do but to exalt it by its influence on reason alone
73518 propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right
73519 no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
73520 it is the duty of every man to render to the creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him

73525 overall currency markets should continue to take their lead from oil prices
73526 the general rule of thumb is that lower oil prices go hand in hand with a stronger us dollar against major currencies this should weigh on asian currencies such as the singapore dollar and taiwan dollar that track major currencies

73546 she was mocked accordingly as all spandex wearers outside of bike racing should be
73547 they are conditioned by popular culture to see cars as symbols of freedom yet city driving is a slow motion trap that subjects drivers to constant restrictions on their movement drivers are thwarted from enjoying the promise of motion by traffic lights by congestion and yes by cyclists and they suffer the natural but impossible desire to escape and move forward all this while being strapped to their seats thats where the frustration begins but drivers carry with them a load of cultural baggage that gets them even more cranked

73553 road safety and percieved risk of cycle facilities in copenhagen
73554 it should be noticed that blue cycle crossings retracted stop lines for cars and pre green lights for cyclists have been used in only very few places on those streets where cycle tracks have been constructed in copenhagen in the studied after periods more extended use of these safety measures would very probably have improved road safety
73555 why would the bikes stop vehicles that are continuing straight on have the right of way over vehicles that are turning regardless of whether they are motorised or not like anywhere else
73556 the media message save gas go by bike is a huge opportunity for the bicycle business but reaching bike to work wannabes is tough newbie cycle commuters dont hang out in bike places we plan to get the bike to work book in front of this new audience through an online and offline pr campaign with gas at 5 a gallon its pushing on an open door the mainstream media is now very open to the bike commute message
73557 in the us cycle use is just one percent of all journeys
73558 in denmark and the netherlands its at least 30 percent it was inspiring to talk to these guys and just amazing to find out that the 30 percent figure is considered too low by copenhagen and amsterdam the goal is 50 percent i cant imagine that ever happening in the us but remember that john burke of trek said last year that if the number of bicycle trips in the us grew from 1 percent to just 5 percent it would result in a 6 2bn industry becoming a 31bn industry
73559 we should exploit all the technological possibilities that can reduce the number of cyclists and pedestrians who are killed or injured because of impact with cars
73560 the number of cyclists and pedestrians who lose their lives in traffic is too high because of that single fact is is most relevant to look at the results from the netherlands and at what initiatives and investment can be made to bring the number down

73581 there were lots of trees down theres a lot of damage
73582 if there were 70 mph winds there is no way that aircraft should have been in that vicinity or landing
73583 we had that big storm go through but after that it was only 8 miles an hour
73584 that tells me they knew they were coming into a dangerous weather pattern and trying to get away from it

73596 ternyata izin pinjam pakai belum ada izin pelepasan belum ada tapi kenapa dia kpc melanjutkan pembabatan hutan di situ seharunya ada izin pemanfataan kayu ipk itu juga belum ada nah semua itu dilanggar makanya tim dari polda kaltim itu turun melakukan penyidikan karena diduga kuat terjadi illegal logging dan illegal mining di situ
73597 terus terang saya sangat menyayangkan kenapa kpc tidak mau menghentikan sementara proses penambangan karena itu jelas bisa menghambat penyidikan harusnya dipahami bahwa surat penghentian sementara yang dikeluarkan wakil bupati isran noor sebagai pejabat pemerintah daerah bukan surat pribadi
73598 tapi mohon media mencatat surat itu bukan untuk menutup tambang tapi hanya menghentikan sementara kegiatan itupun hanya sebatas area yang bermasalah jadi kpc sebagai perusahaan besar harusnya taat hukum dong
73599 seperti jawaban saya kemarin kita tunggu hasil penyidikan dari kepolisian karena yang punya kewenangan untuk menutup dan menghentikan tambang hanya pemerintah pusat yakni menteri esdm melalui dirjen minerpabum
73600 ya itu tadi sesuai pkp2b yang berhak itu hanya dirjen minerpabum
73601 kpc selalu bekerja sesuai ketentuan dan izin yang dimiliki jadi kita tunggu saja proses hukumnya

73621 newspapers are losing their own core market because they didnt understand the scale of the internet they still thought mass when they should have realized that small is the new big that is online newspapers still threw their lot in with the big advertisers who had been the only ones who could afford their mass products they didnt see the mass of potential spending in a new population of small local advertisers who never could afford to advertise in newspapers but who now could afford to buy targeted efficient inexpensive ads online

73627 we are ready to respect the law of baghdad but the government has to represent the people
73628 i started shooting in the air and throughout the town bursts of gunfire echoed across the sky my family understood that the time had come and we started the war against al qaeda
73629 with their help we were able to liberate al qaim
73630 does he really deserve to be in handcuffs for this
73631 i dont usually write about music but i really enjoyed getting involved with this one
73632 its just a set of circumstances that have to be dealt with
73633 we see it in our interests to avoid the word condemnation
73634 how many songs can my hard disk or ipod hold
73635 on the face of it hoarding tens of thousands of digital music files for which one has paid nothing looks like greed plain and simple
73636 will digital playlists completely replace individually hand made compilations by the sheer effort that went into each one every cassette mix tape was a big declaration of love friendship or even anger a mix tape was an event the biggest advantage of making a mix cassette tape was that it almost always forced the creator to hear each song the death of the cassette tape also means the death of the mix tape and thats something worth mourning
73637 i found this song on my ipod and its pretty cool but i dont know who it is
73638 le d mocrate le d fenseur et le garant des principes
73639 franchi la barri re qui s pare lhumour de linsulte et la caricature de la haine
73640 that weird but beautiful indy actress with black hair and really light eyes
73641 in the background just makes me giggle at 1 19 the little break before the chorus i just hang onto the air waiting to hear what comes next
73642 grimm is an excellent example of a great episodic platform game
73643 the v100 vpirb technology provides significant advantages over current personal locator beacon products
73644 the probability of survival in a man overboard event is directly related to the length of time the person spends in the water a conventional personal locator beacon transmits its emergency signal to a land based location while the boat youve fallen off may be ignorant to the fact that youre no longer on board by sending the distress signal straight back to your boat your chances of survival are greatly improved because the people in the best position to rescue you know theres an emergency within moments of you going into the water
73645 but its not a life or death situation because its a win win for him either way
73646 anxiety levels will get high among everybody and i think at the end of the day well have two very good players
73647 i think if people want to see that congestion issue addressed there its going to take a pretty substantial engineering solution
73648 the traffic backup will be almost nil with this configuration
73649 the biggest delay i think would be a 10 second delay it has improved pedestrian accommodation and the potential to be a gateway element to the hospital and the high school
73650 i dont think we could sell this if we didnt have that intersection
73651 we certainly more than anyone understand and acknowledge the issues with that intersection dealing with getting people to and from the hospital and we are extremely supportive and enthusiastic about addressing the issues of congestion and safety
73652 relative to the roundabout its kind of early until theyre farther along i dont have any definitive reaction to how thats designed any improvement to that intersection will impact our properties so until we get clear on their intent were reserving judgment
73653 happily we have other routes to the hospital on prospect and vesper so i think people are aware of that and the ambulance drivers are aware of how to best reach the facility
73654 our greater concern is the public if theyre driving to the facility any delay causes anxiety on their part
73655 theres a huge cost to that without a corresponding improvement to the level of service
73656 for the high amount of capital expenditures that are going to be part of this you want to see some improvement at the end of the day otherwise why are you bothering just leave it if its an intersection thats functioning at an f minus and its going to an f after youve spent millions why do it
73657 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
73658 i was particularly surprised because of the position the hospital took
73659 im sorry that she ever had any kind of anxiety about what happened
73660 our intent was never to put her in any kind of additional anxiety
73661 i would feel personally responsible if i didnt stand up and do something
73662 i expected it to be dragged out and thats the last thing i wanted
73663 its the long lines at check in the crowding the enhanced security procedures the lack of predictability often in whats going to happen between arriving at the airport and getting to the plane all the delays
73664 they are worried about losing control of themselves and panicking and having a heart attack
73665 the flight is the breaking point of a number of negative occurrences
73666 like bad turbulence or they knew someone who was killed by a crop duster
73667 they tend to operate by the basic rule when in doubt expect the worst
73668 how planes fly what keeps them in the air all of the systems in place to make them as safe as possible videos of planes a presentation from a pilot and a meteorologist so they begin to understand what happens
73669 our body senses mislead us our balance sense amplifies so it seems we are falling
73670 i gradually introduce them to planes and flying until the last phase of the program is in fact to take a flight with them
73671 its not a quick fix people have to learn the techniques and apply them
73672 i get really tense especially on the plane waiting for it to take off my heart races i feel hot and flustered
73673 i cant sleep on the plane i need to know whats going on
73674 the person may not have a fear of flying but it accumulates while they are flying and they get angry
73675 it is often aggravated by alcohol leading people to get out of control
73676 i dont view the diplomacy as zero sum its got to be either this country or that country india and china and the united states will provide great opportunities for entrepreneurs businesses throughout the region and theyll provide great opportunities for development of services and goods that people in our big markets want
73677 it provides great opportunities for capital flows that are foreign direct investment which is necessary for economic development
73678 collaboratively on strong strategic areas security areas one area will be theres a great opportunity for all of us to cooperate on the environment

73696 we cook the tomatoes to about 180 degrees which would kill any salmonella even if it was there
73697 attempts to kill salmonella by cooking may result in cross contamination and is not recommended
73698 i dont think the tomato or pepper scare affected us too badly
73699 we didnt serve tomatoes for a few weeks and instead of using fresh vegetables for things like salsa we would use them from a can it didnt have any negative effect on business
73700 my mom is mexican and she loves acapulcos so were here for birthdays special occasions the works
73701 we were glad when they opened one in milford which is closer and more convenient a scare about salmonella jalapenos isnt going to keep me away i trust them to keep me healthy
73702 we have great food suppliers who take care of us we got a phone call once telling us not to use the next shipment and that they would send another one with healthy tomatoes that werent grown in mexico where the problem is coming from
73703 i make sure that my suppliers only bring jalepenos which have been identified as the problem from farms north of the carolinas so theres no chance of infected peppers making it to my restaurant
73704 weve had 26 cases in massachusetts that are linked to the national outbreak we know that since our labs determined that they are an exact match to the strain that is causing problems

73710 if you think for one minute that i would have continued on with her hanging onto the vehicle then you dont know me
73711 when a beautiful young person dies it makes you want to blame somebody
73712 when they die because of their own negligence we do not blame them but we do not blame someone else
73713 the only thing thats been proven beyond a reasonable doubt
73714 is that heather demou while intoxicated jumped onto a moving truck and fell off
73715 if that defendant should have known demou was aboard then he is guilty

73746 hes played the broadmoor probably more times than i have the last five or 10 years
73747 he knows how to read the greens if i get confused or get into a problem he knows my game
73748 hes got a tough time coming up obviously and i think if you asked him he would say he wouldnt want to be anyplace else
73749 hes got a tough week in front of him this will be easy for him
73750 i made three or four really poor swings on the back
73751 i think i under clubbed 10 half a club and it cost me three shots from the middle of the fairway and you just cant do that out here
73752 its great to have him out there he knows the game and he understands me and i dont know what more you can get out of a caddie than that
73753 i spent about 3 hours just stretching before i even went to the range just trying to get loose
73754 its not even my knee i cant even bend down to line up a putt because my thighs hurt so much
73755 im going to get up about 5 oclock and start the whole routine again
73756 i just have to stretch out my knee is pretty bad because of these hills
73757 after my victory in new york a couple of weeks ago im a completely different player
73758 my putter is working now last year my putter was not so good but now its working nice and im feeling a lot of confidence
73759 it was a good day you cant be displeased with a 65 on this course or any course
73760 i hate to say it i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 today
73761 i mean his was the open championship mine was the senior open championship but still when you have it in your grasp like that you have something a little bit in common
73762 so it was a nice walk on tuesday with these guys and i got up and struck the ball nicely i said ok new week lets just go at it again
73763 i played well i just couldnt get it over the hump
73764 some were very mushy very soft they put a lot of moisture in some greens and not in others
73765 it was tough judging especially the second shot not knowing what the golf ball was going to do it got into a bit of a guessing game at the end of the day
73766 its such a mental brain drain by the time you do your calculations and try to figure out whether its 20 percent or 30 percent or 18 percent
73767 by the time you do the math in your head then you have to figure out what shot you want to hit
73768 yes what is it what do you want come on out with it boy or i shall release the dogs
73769 i wondered if i may find employment in your home my parents have gone from me for they cannot afford to keep me i would be willing to work ever so hard please sir have pity on me
73770 la masturbaci n es un entrenamiento jam s un vicio
73771 im not going to think about that at all because if you think about making the cut thats all you think about
73772 you think about other players you start thinking about what position youre in and you start thinking about what you have to do all im going to think about tomorrow is how am i going to make a putt how am i going to hit a fairway
73773 it would be great if i could drive it these distances at sea level
73774 thought leader is a phrase used to describe a futurist or person who is recognized among their peers and mentors for innovative ideas and demonstrates the confidence to promote or share those ideas as actionable distilled insights
73775 for all i know our navy was shooting at whales out there
73776 how to create a casus belli between tehran and washington
73777 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war
73778 the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
73779 in order to provoke an attack which could then be used to justify material breach
73780 the most extraordinary exchange takes place when lt gen michael delong bemoans shrinking political support for neo con war plans on capitol hill and suggests that sympathy for the bush administrations agenda will only be achieved after a new terror attack
73781 rumsfeld agrees that the psychological impact of 9 11 is wearing off and the behavior pattern of citizens in both the u s and europe suggests that they are unconcerned about the threat of terror
73782 so i can understand the argument for not writing something that was rejected uh maybe my attitude always towards editors is theyre mice training to be rats but the point is jejune if you know what that means
73783 american public if you get the right incident the american public will support bang bang kiss kiss you know were into it

73786 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
73787 she got respiratory syncytial virus about a week before christmas she got very ill
73788 time changes the intensity of the pain you feel changes eventually you can focus more on their life than their death
73789 for us its symbolic of how our family has changed tess is no longer here but now shes with us in another way
73790 it was really cute first heather proposed to carolyn then carolyn proposed to her
73791 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
73792 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
73793 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
73794 it was awful there were six inches of dust on the floor there were lots of broken windows and holes in the roof that i had to patch
73795 the location is perfect our organizations are growing and were still trying to get them networked together
73796 were getting the windows taken care of thats one thing thats probably the biggest thing that needs to be done
73797 i was originally operating out of a church mosaic and they decided to put in a clinic so i didnt have a place for my classes jack had called me and explained what he was doing asked me if i was interested in being in the building and i took him up on it
73798 i am happy with the school and it will be better when everything is done everybody knows where it is and that helps too
73799 it has been difficult using my own finances but the things ive been doing in the community have been reflected
73800 robin bisha is having a fund raiser this weekend its a pretty exciting little event that shes got going on
73801 right now were looking at a total rate of at least 50 cents
73802 the fee increases will help us to cover some of the cost no fee increase is to give extra profit to the city
73803 ever since the wave pool was opened its been the same admission price
73804 you cant ride her yet not until shes about 3 years old
73805 right now im just working on taming her and getting her used to noises and distractions
73806 they had all these horses and you would just have to take the one that came out of the chute
73807 we got really lucky with angel shes just so sweet
73808 but the thing i like about mustangs is they all have their own personalities and theyre all different
73809 we call her daddy longlegs because her legs are just so long
73810 mustangs dont have just one look theyre kind of a heinz 57
73811 about three years ago we contacted the bureau of land management its been my lifelong dream to own a mustang
73812 shane said he wants a horse in every color but we want him to train angel and give her up so someone else can give her a good home
73813 some people shave their hair cause i guess it makes them look better but for this contest they want a natural look
73814 the other people with mustangs couldnt do anything close to this
73815 sometimes i have to remind him shes only a baby
73816 id like to do something like zoology maybe like kind of like steve irwin
73817 they dont think i ride at all i guess i dont look like i ride
73818 but the mustang part they usually think thats really cool
73819 the whole goal is to try and reach out to groups that are going to protest we recognize their free speech rights but the concern on our end is that we dont want anybody to get hurt or have any property damage
73820 if i wanted to donate the land they would be happy to accept it
73821 my feeling was that i would be happy to give langley a deal but not donate the land for nothing
73822 these people worked in the turbulent times including the gyrations of the economy a prolonged depression and two world wars

73833 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
73834 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
73835 hes got a long way to go and there are a number of people in the party that have ambition
73836 there are plenty who will have a go at the right time so i dont think its going to be an easy passage for peter whenever and im not sure that hell ever be drafted
73837 the iaaf has provisionally suspended seven athletes from russia for doping offences a decision which has been acknowledged by the all russia athletics federation araf
73838 the athletes have been charged for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
73839 these rule violations were established following the deliberate storage of samples by the iaaf and re analysis using comparative dna techniques and were the result of a specific investigation which was instigated and carried out by the iaaf for more than a year
73840 the iaaf will make no further comment until a final decision has been taken by the araf which now takes over the responsibility to adjudicate these cases
73841 this iaaf decision dashes our athletes hopes to perform at beijing
73842 dass man menschen methodisch umbringen k nnte nur weil es menschen anderer herkunft waren das vermochten sie nicht zu glauben ich aber glaubte es
73843 sie haben da einen western gemacht in einer szene stehen sie am ufer eines flusses unbewaffnet ihnen gegen ber ein killer der den colt gezogen hat sie wissen dass sie in der n chsten sekunde tot sein werden und da und da senke ich meinen sch del und sto e ihn dem killer in den bauch cooper bernahm das wort der bursche kippt aus den socken f llt ins wasser ich mit einem hechtsprung hinterher ich schwimme unter wasser 20 meter 30 tauche auf sie ballern wie die verr ckten ich tauche wieder komme hoch und diesmal schie en sie nicht mehr sie glauben dass ich l ngst abgesoffen bin und genauso war es bei mir sagte ich langsam

73845 and im happy to say that success hasnt changed us at all
73846 i dont know where it came from to be honest
73847 i think in rainbows has its moments of fraught tension like bodysnatchers obviously but it ends up in a good space it starts off pretty anxious but the end of by that point everything is like ahhh getting it out of your system
73848 what was great about kid a was that it heralded a new period and it meant we went off in some cool new places
73849 but the downside was that in the whole period up until the end of hail to the thief we picked up some nasty habits
73850 we were going along in a certain trajectory and then suddenly with hail to the thief it was we cant carry along in that way anymore
73851 to me the hardest thing was finding a reason to carry on
73852 the key thing in actually propelling it forward was nigel coming back into the process
73853 the reality when we got in there was it still wasnt good enough we really had to raise our standards quite a lot
73854 well get very attached to a song as an idea in its very basic form but we also know we cant really leave it like that so thats what we spend our time talking about and planning and thinking about thom will sit and play pyramid song on piano for example and its obviously not finished it needs a rhythm to propel it along but what do you do with it and yet not mess it up so thats the sort of enjoyable pressure we like to be under
73855 its part of my repertoire its what i do some people go and work at something they dont like others talk about disconnection a lot
73856 when we werent signed to emi and didnt have a contract that threw up all this mad ness
73857 in a way your possibilities are endless and limitless and meaningless you actually suddenly have i dont know why it doesnt make sense but there was a complete lack of connection with our past
73858 the truth of the matter is that none of those rethinking things would be occurring if we werent vibed up on the fact that we finished something the energy always comes from an excitement about what one has done
73859 when you hear thom and jonny in the soundcheck and theyve come up with something and start playing it its good to hear
73860 whats interesting to me is very old technologies like orchestras and pianos and things and how they meet modern recording and treatment techniques
73861 long ago in china an epic battle between good and evil took place
73862 i do love the ladies but the ladies dont love me
73863 if you get 12 rebounds everything else will fall into place otherwise its the army
73864 my life sucks right now but what if its even worse after high school
73865 that whole run of houses has been a problem for quite a while
73866 these idiots dont know which house theyre going to to buy drugs
73867 they still had customers coming up after the bust yesterday
73868 they were banging on the door and hollering but no one was home

73901 como todos ustedes saben el estado a trav s de los organismos competentes ha demandado permanentemente a la justicia de que los represores sean internados en lugares comunes y no nos equivoc bamos
73902 el episodio que nos toc vivir con respecto al prefecto febres creo que es demostrativo de lo acertado que est bamos cuando est bamos demandando que fueran precisamente sometidos al servicio penitenciario nacional en c rceles comunes
73903 si el poder ejecutivo sostuvo c rcel com n por qu no lo ejecut el presidente es jefe de las fuerzas armadas y por lo tanto podr a disponer con levantar su tel fono el paso a c rceles no dependientes de las fuerzas armadas o de seguridad y evitar los privilegios de los jerarcas genocidas en esas instituciones militares as como tambi n lo sucedido con febres
73904 todos los miembros de la prefectura que obedecen directamente a an bal fern ndez y que dependen directamente del poder ejecutivo eran los que los que visitaban a febres com an con l sab an que l estaba ah en ning n momento las autoridades dieron la orden de que fuera a una c rcel com n

73950 unless our bid can be conducive to our marketing efforts and enhancing our brand value we wont do it
73951 so far the companys senior management has held no talks nor has the board received any plan
73952 thanks to our hedging policy we were able to contain oil related costs to a minimum this quarter but expect to see them rise as the year progresses and so the outlook for our fuel bill is not optimistic
73953 would not be surprised to see classic lease rates drop 10 over the next 12 18 months
73954 what is fundamentally different this time is that on a global basis there is more demand for aircraft
73955 we are not seeing big order cancellations at airbus and boeing
73956 some substantial transition costs as we grow quickly to fill the void
73957 our research however shows that this may not be possible for all corals
73958 this study is one of few that follows individual colonies over a two year period and shows that individual colonies of the stony coral stylophora pistillata do not change their symbionts as a response to temperature stress
73959 the sensitivity to bleaching conditions and survival appears tightly linked with fine scale differences in the genetic identity of the zooxanthellae that were present within the coral colonies
73960 because corals with sensitive zooxanthellae suffer high mortality after bleaching we see a shift in the symbiont community towards more tolerant types
73961 the important message here is that this shift is not due to the uptake of different symbionts by individual colonies but by differential mortality between sensitive and tolerant colonies
73962 the result is a decrease in diversity of both the coral host and their symbionts
73963 the reduced diversity will have a negative effect on reef resilience since it makes the ecosystem more vulnerable to fluctuations in other environmental factors
73964 this is worrying since coral reefs are likely to face a suite of stressors in the future
73965 bleaching susceptibility and mortality of corals determined by fine scale differences in symbiont type

74010 i hate to see the county have to pay taxpayer money on this stuff
74011 your honor im confused that thats the way they do this
74012 that is not what were taught in civil process class
74013 do you know who put the lock on the door
74014 the scores from the first round of testing remained on par with our past scores they have remained consistent
74015 if a child is not successful a parent can appeal their retention
74016 a committee will meet and look at grades attendance and test scores throughout the year to determine if the child can be promoted
74017 we believe that after the grade placement committee meetings we will have that many students who will be promoted
74018 the belief is that if a student has passed everything during the year and they struggled to pass the test the committee might pass them in the hopes that they could pass the ninth grade version of the test
74019 we need to make sure that everything in our curriculum is lined up with the teks texas essential knowledge and skills
74020 obviously we want to continue to grow and improve our scores
74021 especially with the new leadership that has come into our administration
74022 i think a 9 percent increase in math scores after retakes is pretty telling
74023 the bottom line is that we do have a large number of students who took that test and passed it
74024 they took some coins and a portable radio that i use at baseball games
74025 i am not so much angry if i am angry at anyone i am angry with myself for leaving the car unlocked i am pleased they caught someone
74026 dont leave your phone and camera on the front seat they are items that are easily taken and quickly sold
74027 often car radios are coded for a specific car so stealing them is useless they are not going to work and cant be sold
74028 most things that are not actually attached to the car are not covered in your insurance for the car they may be covered by your home contents insurance
74029 people will take their gps system off the windshield and leave the mark from the suction cap that it is attached with
74030 a window is easily broken the system is taken and taken to a pawn shop
74031 usually where there are a few cars in the area when the thefts occur
74032 we should always take loose valuables out the car the same goes for ipods and cameras we have so much stuff that we use everyday
74033 how often are we told to lock up our cars and make sure the windows are up i was just speaking to a friend that had her handbag stolen from the front seat of her car when she went in to pay for gas she left the car for one minute and it was gone
74034 go ahead and ask a consumer today what type of music they listen to and the response will be everything how do you quantify everything you cant
74035 i have been for the last several years very interested in taking another position
74036 and this appointment does not allow me to hold my position as district 55 representative
74037 its going to be a fairly seamless system and district 55 will continue to be represented
74038 even though i announced my intent to retire more than a year ago i am now resigning a few months before my term ends so that i can in earnest begin a new chapter in my life
74039 i have been privileged to serve the good people of bell county for 18 years
74040 i take from my time in public life a critical knowledge of the needs of our growing state the friendship of so many and a deep respect and love for texas

74044 apparently when premier listened to pete rocks lone contribution to illmatic he went back to the lab scrapped what he already had and started over whether this is true or not is open to debate but it is a pleasingly romantic vision of the creative process that went into the construction of the album and a tale that confirms what you already know
74045 your love is so wrong for me i just keep on trying to pull a pin from the page to pull the words from my mouth in a cold fit of rage
74046 all i can say when the band begins to play theres no angel on my side and i will need you on my side
74047 ill take you with me wherever i go singing your sweet songs i know so well halfway to heaven still halfway to hell im going home to you now home to you now oh it wont be long
74048 when my son bounds out of kindergarten at his school a typical request is to go to old mcdonalds
74049 levi strauss has been an aggressive enemy of the boy scouts and not only stopped its donations to the boy scouts over its policy on homosexuals but began to aggressively market its products to homosexuals in their magazines
74050 like levi strauss mcdonalds has become an open and aggressive supporter of the homosexual agenda
74051 as such it will no longer receive my business until it rejects the homosexual political agenda and returns to what it does best selling happy meals and fun to americas children

74054 who woulda thunk creationists and republicans had bum bum sex
74055 lies have no feet to cover up a lie told you invent another hundreds of lies eventually you end up get caught in a web of your own lies
74056 in the last week there has been speculation over an alleged sting operation
74057 is it the job of a tv channel to provide proof to any constitutional authority in this case the speaker before telecasting the news to its viewers
74058 as it transpired even before we could complete the process of investigation three bjp mps made allegations in parliament of having been bribed and displayed cash in the house
74059 no another visa is not possible unless i had been out of the country for at least 3 months
74060 yes i could get another visa if i went to seoul for two weeks and waited
74061 yes i could have a visa processed in sapporo if i either waited for two three weeks or got an immigration stamp that allowed me to stay in japan for 91 days in which case it would only take 2 days
74062 a single or double entry visa could be processed overnight in tokyo
74063 esta pueril insumisi n a las condiciones que la realidad nos impone esa incapacidad de aceptar alegremente el destino esa pretensi n ingenua de creer que es f cil suplantarlo por nuestros est riles deseos son rasgos de un esp ritu que ahora fenece dejando su puesto a otro completamente antag nico
74064 i have never made but one prayer to god a very short one o lord make my enemies ridiculous and god granted it
74065 im developing cowboy bebop for fox but doing it as a live action film so im working on that at the moment
74066 im really excited to be working on it and its in the really early stages we just signed it the other day
74067 i have such an enormous admiration for its creators that our first and foremost concern is going to be a real degree of faithfulness to the tone of the movie to the mix of genres and so on and so forth
74068 when i met with them in japan one of the first things that i brought up was the experience that we had on a scanner darkly and how hard we worked to remain faithful to philip k dick and that was our big concern here
74069 yes we are humans we are not animals any more we have a brain which is the ultimate source of human joy and human joy is different from animal joy
74070 only if we let it work independently on its own
74071 not the least its only a mapping of our past thought structure which we keep intact in our psyche and then we tend to locate every new sensation somewhere or the other within this old pattern of thoughts forcibly and thus kill its spirit of being something unique to this moment of perception
74072 like right now i am feeling like hugging and kissing you wild like an animal but thats only what my body knows to do and it has come to know it from its past animal experience that its mind has given to it
74073 and your brain has refused to listen to your mind
74074 yes because its wanting to search our true nature yours and mine and it is ready to face the biggest adrenalin challenge for its sake
74075 we have no idea what its about hes still on the job
74076 weve been number crunching since march looking at different options different ways to save taxpayers money not only this year but for the future also
74077 the real accomplishment is three unlikely bedfellows working together and creating something positive for the town
74078 mandatory union pay increases skyrocketing fuel costs increased pension and insurance contributions did not make the job an easy one
74079 at the heart of deliberations was the desire to preserve and in some cases increase services to residents
74080 it is the second time in the past two weeks that i argue with gerb on constitutional matters
74081 were inviting people to come dressed in their prom outfits or any kind of costume that is any character from the book
74082 theyre gripping and just really delightful and my understanding is that everyone who reads it feels the same way which is why no one can wait for the release
74083 that prom became kind of a theme for all the fans of
74084 so anytime you go to a stephenie meyer book signing or stephenie meyer party its usually prom themed because of that
74085 it takes a different twist on the vampire that im not used to and i really quite enjoyed it and the way she developed the characters
74086 i thought they were nicer i thought they were newer and i think they have a better seating area theyre much more comfortable
74087 you have more width room so youre not cramped against the person next to you
74088 since you went to two to two seating from three to two seating you lost something but you also gain because of the two levels and the comfort level
74089 i have macular degeneration and i cant see that great but i can see that red line
74090 sometimes i get a little impatient with the wait especially when there are amateurs who dont know how to play
74091 we try to squeeze in as many games as we can i want to beat him very badly hes got bad eyes and he still beats me
74092 our objective is not for them to just have fun but also to improve the health of the senior citizens
74093 we find that 20 to 30 minutes of exercise will benefit the seniors weve had 170 seniors play in south brunswick since may so its had a very good impact
74094 what bothers me when i visit senior centers is the number of people sitting in chairs chit chatting knitting or playing bingo
74095 not that those are a waste of time but the seniors need to participate in physical activities with the wii its fun but it as the benefit of exercise whatever way we can help keep these seniors healthy will benefit everyone in the long run
74096 its really taken off more than i could have ever imagined
74097 its great for exercise as well as socialization it crosses cultural boundaries because our non english speaking members are playing too even very sedentary people like our bridge players and the people in our knitting group get up and play its been really cool
74098 looks good enough what would you really expect seriously i bet your one of the ones that says that video of gohan with the androids looks good the one made by fans just look at their costumes the use friggin spray painted rubber boots for gohan and you think this gi looks bad ha lol you stupid
74099 money is a singular thing it ranks with love as mans greatest source of joy and with death as his greatest source of anxiety over all history it has oppressed nearly all people in one of two ways either it has been abundant and very unreliable or reliable and very scarce
74100 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth

74145 bates who was appointed to the bench by bush issued a 93 page opinion that strongly rejected the administrations legal arguments he noted that the executive branch could not point to a single case in which courts held that white house aides were immune from congressional subpoenas
74146 in his ruling u s district judge john bates said theres no legal basis for bushs argument that his former legal counsel miers must appear before congress
74147 a president and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately these are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for presidential communications the privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the constitution
74148 we conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice the generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial
74149 but this presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law
74150 the twofold aim of criminal justice is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer
74151 a game like wow requires only voluminous amounts of time in order to be good at it
74152 its early days and different players are at different levels of fitness at the moment

74159 younes kaboul has decided not to sign for us and we wish him well
74160 i think it might have helped if i had taken him to the casino until four in the morning what do i mean youre intelligent work it out people have different ways of dealing with different players but its a long time since i was still up at four in the morning thats not my style
74161 younes made his decision and the important thing for me is that i got the chance to bring him to the club for a look around and to speak to him
74162 im really happy to have signed i just want to get started now and play some games
74163 ive enjoyed my time here so far the lads have been great with me and the coaching staff have helped me settle in
74164 this is a brilliant signing for the club and its one im very excited about charlie has done really well in pre season with us
74165 he has all the liverpool traditions hes got great touch vision and technique hell bring a touch of artistry to the side and im sure hell go a long way in the game hopefully with tranmere
74166 its nice to see the growing links between tranmere and liverpool

74168 i started off there playing many matches but then i picked up a knee injury and everything ended

74174 were delighted that hes come here he has big premier league experience and he is certainly going to add the quality that we already have
74175 were confident we can challenge for the top four this season weve had a good pre season scored plenty of goals and the fans are excited by the new players that have come in

74183 previous research has shown some clear negatives about suvs in terms of safety but they are not as unsafe as many people make out
74184 however there are three key factors which do compromise their safety record which have been established by research here and overseas
74185 this means that if you are looking for a really safe vehicle for you and other road users you wouldnt generally choose a suv as it is not the best vehicle on the road in terms of overall road safety
74186 when it comes to that decision my recommendation is to choose a stable crashworthy vehicle with multiple safety features such as airbags and which is less likely to do harm to other road users some guidance on this is available on the land transport new zealand web site
74187 previous studies suggested that despite getting inadequate sleep kids could tolerate it and still function

74348 we originally started the night to break into djing at a time when it was tough to get gigs on your own it was our calling card to manchesters vibrant scene
74349 the night has come back to being a group of old friends putting on a night for a load of friends who spend far too much time on the dancefloor
74350 i think the fact that three of us have known each other since junior school really adds to the appeal of the night
74351 it creates an infectious spirit that spreads to the dancefloor from the dj booth
74352 well what i can remember of it anyway and looking back i think its amazing to think that even after all these years its the group of us have never fallen out over anything to do with the night or the music played
74353 you need a little warmth chuck to survive these hills

74359 there was understandable disappointment among harry potter fans when only one copy of the tales of beedle the bard was offered to the public last december

74364 even i am shocked im expecting my sister that i dont have to be my father
74365 they try to sell it racier and sexier than it actually is
74366 if critics watched the show they would see it is not as racy as it actually seems but because we dont have numbers it is about buzz the marketers try to put us in the tabloids all the time and make up crazy stories about us
74367 its like gossip magazine on tv people love to gossip and watch people living glamorous lives
74368 i dont think were trying to preach to anyone how to live their life
74369 its like sex and the city with more drama and for younger kids
74370 its kind of like what you want life to be all the girls come off really pretty and dress really well and are so confident
74371 high school girls as little more than gossipy sex objects is simply a tired cliche that does all females a disservice
74372 it glamorises and normalises the kinds of behaviour that may seem charmingly risque and sophisticated when little girls see them on tv but which if emulated in real life can result in emotional and psychological distress for them
74373 while you all may be taking a stance similar to 15 year old girls who get called ugly in the gym i am not

74379 it addresses climate change issues and ensures a secure local independent power supply while also creating new jobs
74380 we commend our industry partners like xantrex for making this city tour a reality
74381 industry partners are necessary because solar energy is complex there are key concepts like interconnection standards net metering and others that national state and local officials need to understand in order to make the right decisions about solar for their communities we are simply bringing the knowledge to them as an industry so cities can deploy cost effective solar energy when and where it makes sense to them
74382 i do not like seriousness i think it is irreligious or if you prefer the phrase it is the fashion of all false religions the man who takes everything seriously is the man who makes an idol of everything he bows down to the wood and stone until his limbs are rooted as the roots of a tree or his head as fallen as the stone sunken by the roadside
74383 one is just the starting point the springboard hope jumps off of
74384 wir gehen diese entscheidung anfang der kommenden woche in aller ruhe an vor dem ersten pflichtspiel soll das geregelt sein
74385 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
74386 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
74387 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
74388 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives
74389 he essentially admitted to his conduct which was outrageous and clearly life threatening and has changed the lives of these victims in many ways
74390 of course theyve forgotten that gsp has a fight with me first
74391 but that just shows you where some people really are still in this sport and how they still have no idea whats going on there are a lot of so called experts out there but they know nothing about the sport theyre spectators on the outside watching the sport through a telescope and they think theyre on the inside and know everything but they dont
74392 id say that the author of a popular book has far more aggregate influence than do one set of parents so if the book is very popular and captures the imaginations of kids presto youve done a lot to insure that the ideas that are important to you live long after you pass on if its the ideas that matter then i suppose that there are ways that folks like you can propagate the ideas without having your own kids be your lab rats

74406 the biblical principal of true repentence is that the offended party is given compensation to make up for that which has been stolen from them the losses that have been inflicted upon them and their families
74407 let us not forget that marxism as the one great political force of our twentieth century made its appearance with the claim to be bringing a new world of freedom and of free people this very promise of knowing the scientifically guaranteed way to freedom and of creating the new world drew to it many of the boldest spirits of our age ultimately it even appeared as the force through which the christian teaching of redemption could be transformed into a realistic practical means for liberation as the force that could bring the kingdom of god as the true kingdom of men the collapse of realist socialism in the east european states has not quite laid aside all such hopes and here and there they still subsist silently awaiting some new form
74408 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule it
74409 i know my country has not perfected itself at times weve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people weve made our share of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions
74410 i know my mother has not perfected herself at times she has struggled to keep the promise of fairness for all of her children she has made her share of mistakes and there are times when her actions around the town have not lived up to her best intentions

74415 australia was great fun the wickets certainly helped me score the runs that i did
74416 initially the wickets were pretty damp batting in the first few games wasnt easy at all but once i got the hang of playing on those tracks it became much easier
74417 i worked on a lot of aspects in the off season and not all of it was mental conditioning
74418 my time at the national cricket academy nca helped me a lot and i am very grateful to all the coaches there i owe a lot to them
74419 they helped me work on my driving transferring my body weight and a lot of other smaller things
74420 well honestly i would be lying if i said i dont think of a possible call up but yes at the moment all i want to do is play well
74421 at this point there is no satisfaction but theres still plenty of cricket left
74422 if i can make this a big one maybe score 200 and take the total to 400 500 and put the team in a good position then i will be satisfied because then we can put pressure on sri lanka
74423 while indias mini collapse meant that honours were even at the end of the first day despite their brilliant start sehwag managed to keep going and theres hope still on the second day
74424 i was not jolted by the fall of wickets they all got out to good balls
74425 the bowling was quality murali mendis and vaas theyre the kind of bowlers who can bowl a good ball at any time and you have to play them carefully
74426 it does look that way when you get out but i always back myself and play my shots how can i stop that if the ball is there to be hit i hit it
74427 you sometimes do think what if i play a shot and get out after four wickets have fallen but if you dont play your shots how will you make runs
74428 i was picking him off the wicket whenever he bowled i was seeing how the ball behaved after pitching and played him accordingly
74429 it was important for me and gautam to give a good start and we did that hopefully well carry on like that only
74430 in either case we need to accurately represent what we do
74431 even that model festivals stopped working music has been in such a weird decline in the past few years

74433 yes we are humans we are not animals any more we have a brain which is the ultimate source of human joy and human joy is different from animal joy
74434 only if we let it work independently on its own
74435 not the least its only a mapping of our past thought structure which we keep intact in our psyche and then we tend to locate every new sensation somewhere or the other within this old pattern of thoughts forcibly and thus kill its spirit of being something unique to this moment of perception
74436 like right now i am feeling like hugging and kissing you wild like an animal but thats only what my body knows to do and it has come to know it from its past animal experience that its mind has given to it
74437 and your brain has refused to listen to your mind
74438 yes because its wanting to search our true nature yours and mine and it is ready to face the biggest adrenalin challenge for its sake

74479 spearhead the rehabilitation and acceleration of education and health infrastructure in the country
74480 would they go against a measure that will finally give our country with a public education system that will match the public education systems of developed nations
74481 a direct way to lift millions of our people out of the cycle of poverty by providing them the best quality education possible
74482 by lifting people out of poverty it is not unlikely that the telcos will also be assured of not only continued demand for their services but also a higher demand for higher value services
74483 with this law the department of education will be completely focused on academic concerns and not be distracted by infrastructure and logistics
74484 knowing we were so close makes us realize how good we can be
74485 were definitely moving the football program in the right direction
74486 we need more depth talent and speed but were moving in the right direction
74487 but one guy isnt going to be enough at any position for us to be any good
74488 weve got to find at least one or two other kids at running back that can come in that can give him a blow and change of pace maybe somebody that brings a little different element to the game than greg does

74494 smes on average reported stronger conditions than their larger business counterparts this outperformance was particularly evident in victoria queensland and to a lesser extent sa amp nsw
74495 smes in wa performed in line with their larger counterparts
74496 it is clear that regardless of size all smes are feeling the effects of a weakening level of consumer confidence increasing input costs and concern about the rate of economic growth

74556 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
74557 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
74558 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
74559 theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails
74560 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me
74561 what were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
74562 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
74563 from obamas repeated suggestion that hes running a racist campaign
74564 when he did it the first time yesterday we let it pass when he did it again later specifically linking us to it we decided to respond
74565 it is im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and we dont theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
74566 what we are talking about here is substance and not style
74567 campaigns are tough but i am proud of the campaign we have run im proud of the issues we have raised
74568 all theyre doing is churning out the same stuff they do every four years all you have to do is change the name
74569 so when you hear my opponent say hes too risky what theyre really saying is we know we dont have any good ideas but you should be worried about him
74570 it seems to me at this point it would be naive of the obama campaign not to anticipate efforts to tear at obamas character the way bush tore away at john kerrys character four years ago so if a fellow can rationally expect a swift boat full of funny racial angles racing at him he would only be sane to try to deflect that
74571 when they need congressional assistance they use the pac to build relationships to work towards achieving a legislative goal other times when they have involuntarily become the object of congressional interest they use the pac to build relationships in an effort to avoid negative legislation
74572 he was a very early supporter of senator obama and began that support long before the senate investigation into tax havens
74573 hes very interested in politics and he gives to both sides
74574 peter lowy never took any action to hide his ownership in anything
74575 peter lowy did not do anything improper or illegal or unethical
74576 the iron ring of secrecy around tax haven banks and their deceptive banking practices enable and encourage tax cheats to hide assets from the united states
74577 that was probably some of the best stuff ive had all year i was able to keep the ball down
74578 i dont know exactly how it all worked out but im happy it did
74579 hes going to bring another element to our offense its going to be a great addition i think everyones looking forward to getting him out there tomorrow and letting him do his thing
74580 youre not allowed much leeway when you pitch against a guy like webb
74581 you really have to pitch near perfect baseball to beat him thats always a good challenge but you know youve got to put up zeros the most frustrating thing was getting a one run lead and giving it back on 10 pitches
74582 the rest was my part thats the game right there
74583 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
74584 this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
74585 im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
74586 i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
74587 i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
74588 to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
74589 and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
74590 its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
74591 i dont sit before you today to ask that you ban the paparazzi
74592 im asking you to regulate it officialize it tax it legitimize it
74593 i dont want to beg the city of los angeles to give me 1987 back
74594 i love being a famous musician in 2008 this is about safety
74595 law governing an acceptable filming distance from an unwilling subject to keep everybody safe and misbehavior accountable
74596 regulating the paparazzi wont bring an end to modern day media coverage just as the newly enforced hands free law hasnt stopped people from talking on cell phones while they drive
74597 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
74598 so as far as all this grandstanding and foolishness waste of city time on this issue and the fact that i felt aggravated enough about it to interrupt my workout to come over and set the record straight lapd has no intention of participating in this farce
74599 es besteht keine chance dass ich in peking spielen kann die zeit f r so eine verletzung ist sehr ungl cklich und das macht mich trauriger als alles andere im moment
74600 bis zuletzt habe ich gehofft dass es sich nur um ein problem mit einem nerv handelt jetzt wei ich leider dass diese verletzung sehr viel zeit braucht um auszuheilen
74601 one of the places i would like them to visit is this place laventille can be the new tourist hotspot
74602 why cant they stop off at our lady of laventille statue stop off by picton fort stop off by the water tanks
74603 it has become a clich d statement that still rings true that while slavery as physical bondage has ended mental and emotional slavery continues
74604 people of all heritages remain trapped in exploitative situations at the hands of some unscrupulous employers thousands also remain imprisoned in a government induced dependency syndrome where they are forced to work continually in the low paying insecure make work programmes that do not even after decades lift them into independence but make millionaires of others
74605 there is nothing that can be said to dull the brutality of your attack an attack with a cutlass on someone who did nothing to you cannot be excused
74606 the accused also suffers from epilepsy which led to him having seizures and blackouts for much of his life
74607 having regard to his hard life coupled by the abuse he suffered this would have led to his unprovoked attack on khan
74608 had a hard life and grew up in an orphanage
74609 police have to have respect for them and listen to them
74610 the criminals start at 5 a m we cant start at 7 a m
74611 which in the chambers view is due largely to a lack of enforcement of the countrys laws on a sustained basis
74612 too much said about crime and it still in our faces
74613 it will take another two to three weeks before we see a recovery from the floods and a decrease in market prices provided we dont have more floods

74615 she said she was being kept in a back road in san fernando and then the phone went dead

74618 national and individual emancipation must be an ongoing effort for both leadership and citizens of this country
74619 notwithstanding our challenges we are a nation on the move let us on this day remember the part played in our present progress by that momentous development that took place 170 years ago
74620 let us celebrate emancipation day with pride and deep reflection in the resolve that we will help one another to improve our lives
74621 among the most pivotal contributions is the leadership they helped to provide along with brethren of their origin in the struggle against colonialism and to build the foundations of our society in the post independence era making an enduring contribution to the transformation of this country
74622 moreover they have also paved the way for their own greater contribution as well as that of all other citizens in the cultural social and economic development of our country
74623 it is fantastic very good however to appeal to the private sector it has to be a very attractive proposal
74624 the caribbean government has decided to lease out to indian farmers seven plots each measuring 100 acres for 30 years

74626 nathan was one of the clubs finest members and he cycled right up until he died
74627 nathan did a great service to the sport of cycling and this is a fitting way of honouring a past cyclist that has given us so much
74628 none of which has brought this issue to a satisfactory conclusion
74629 my only role at this time is to give the federation that cushion of hope that faith that belief that everything that can be possibly done to ensure this country qualifies for south africa 2010 will in fact be done
74630 it would be foolish not to listen to the cry of the national coach remember the oval is there for our use free of cost but the coach nor the players believe that it would be in their best interest to play on the oval surface
74631 we need to free our minds so that the new imperial powers can no longer use us as clones and labour to be exploited at will
74632 to do that we have to be able to recognise the modern day salve raiders in our own midst and take a stand against them
74633 those who we hold up as leaders must empower us not keep us down our ancestors struggled for the elevation and freedom of all not just a select few
74634 while steel shackles no longer hold our bodies the enslavement of our minds is all too prevalent
74635 they have already been through so much and when one of them said they rather live under a tree than have to live apart i could not allow it

74650 the co operation we have and continue to receive from residents to make the parade free of dj music is quite an achievement we have observed that other pan parades are being reduced to electronic music inviting steelbands to perform at an event where they are rivalled by dj music is disturbing this festival is about pure pan music a celebration of the drum

74669 there will be guys at practice on friday who we havent seen this summer
74670 there is a reason we take it a little slow at first

74694 speaking at the campus progress journalism conference earlier this month seymour hersh a pulitzer prize winning journalist for the new yorker revealed that bush administration officials held a meeting recently in the vice president s office to discuss ways to provoke a war with iran hersh explained that during the meeting in cheney s office an idea was considered to dress up navy seals as iranians put them on fake iranian speedboats and shoot at them this idea intended to provoke an iran war was ultimately rejected
74695 for six years with few exceptions the washington press corps has been cheerleading for the iraq war and the pattern is continuing in campaign 2008 with the endless demands that barack obama apologize for not supporting the troop surge obama s efforts to point to other factors that predated the surge such as the anbar awakening the sunni tribal rejection of al qaeda extremists and cease fires ordered by radical shiite cleric moqtada al sadr fall on deaf ears

74714 no passado os chineses acreditavam que um drag o celeste ou um c o devorava o sol durante o eclipse

74719 i just had to go out there and throw strikes and thats what i did and it went well
74720 after about 30 games people begin to notice that im not a big slow guy
74721 all i can do is go out there and produce when my name is called
74722 obviously i want to be in the lineup every day but i know if i start to do what i have to when they call on me that ill stick in the lineup i think thats starting to happen now
74723 wherever they put me on the field i have to continue to produce
74724 if i keep hitting the way i have been and can get even hotter i know that i can stay in the lineup
74725 league mvp marlon james is in talks to join san jose and the st vincent amp grenadines strike ace claims he will be bringing veteran st v amp g midfielder bernard huggings with him

74728 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time online casinos shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
74729 our online casinos research division has been able to harness the power of data mining and databasing to better understand to best way forward
74730 and as a result finding key online casinos market trends can be easily made through simple algorithms
74731 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important online casinos human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
74732 weve been working on this online casinos project for 8 months now
74733 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
74734 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road

74738 the rider in front isnt likely the one who wins
74739 hes the one strategically protecting his team leader behind him
74740 the better guys will work with their teammates and work behind them so their legs stay fresh and then they break away
74741 youre going to see a bunch of people riding together you may see someone break away the big question is will they be able to stay away you usually see them try to break away in groups and get swallowed up at the front and spit out in the back

74747 i believe if im going to bring something into my classroom and teach it to my kids im going to do it the right way by getting hands on first
74748 i became passionate with the story because it was so local i brought it into the classroom and had a blast explaining to my students how this ice age mammal was found 15 minutes away so they thought that was cool
74749 then the great find happened here in 2005 and brought back the same excitement
74750 every student in anns class for the past 10 years just hangs on every word she says
74751 thats just her ability to relate to the students so whenever we have an exciting project with the forest preserve i know her class will be interested because ann is interested
74752 there are so many wetlands throughout the county and state and they are all candidates to have housed mastodons and mammoths
74753 so its a crapshoot most ancient elephants are found during restoration work for other projects
74754 if those teeth hadnt been found theres no way anyone would have found the rest of this
74755 this would have all been the middle of nowhere the ones that we do find were lucky to find them
74756 we dont really study the ice age in school which is what makes this opportunity unique
74757 we get dirty but its well worth it especially if we find a skeleton
74758 at numerous times ive written donate back on tickets ive bought
74759 ive always looked at it as being a good cause
74760 hes just a genuinely nice person in any way you deal with him
74761 he does so much to help out organizations in the community and he doesnt want recognition
74762 i enjoy helping i think that brings joy to all of us when we can help when you do its a good feeling
74763 when you think about it its a pretty cool thing
74764 but i think itd be neat if that would happen more often it would be nice if this inspired others to do it
74765 my initial point was that eva intentionally did not tie in relevant data into her post
74766 we want to engage in the political process and be part of the decision making in our city
74767 this is a very big case and something were going to try to curb with the aggressive enforcement we have in the state
74768 our message is that the retailers need to do a better job of monitoring their manufacturers monitoring their contractors
74769 all have social responsibility systems that have failed to detect this major sweatshop operation
74770 while you may require your suppliers to abide by strict codes of conduct these codes do workers no good if they are not aggressively enforced
74771 if you work full time you should not be living in poverty
74772 government price setting has never been good for the economy and they are setting the price of labor
74773 if you want more people hired you dont make it more expensive to hire them
74774 there is no free lunch it is coming from somewhere
74775 what people forget is that workers are not just workers they are customers
74776 jobs are being lost but that has to do with the economy and very little to do with wages
74777 what is really wrong is that american workers have not been sharing with the growth of the country
74778 to match the buying power of the minimum wage in the 1960s it would have to rise to 9 or 10 an hour i think this is an important small step
74779 youve got to have some people but you can have less people
74780 its a positive but small step to dealing with income inequality
74781 what really has to happen is that workers need to be given the right to organize unions and negotiate their own wages
74782 workers are more expense and employers are less willing to hire
74783 we believe you should just let the marketplace decide and it looks like it already has
74784 its helping me to be able to save up for books
74785 with more money in their pockets maybe well see more teenagers in here on weekends
74786 i dont think its something thats going to be resolved all that quickly
74787 i believe we should never have to make these kinds of choices ever again
74788 north carolina has got so many open seats from the presidency down to the courthouse that are competitive
74789 anytime you have that many competitive races youre going to see this sort of thing
74790 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
74791 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
74792 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
74793 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
74794 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
74795 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
74796 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
74797 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
74798 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
74799 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
74800 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
74801 the fact that i am expecting a child is my personal and private business this has no relationship to nor does it involve john edwards in any way andrew young is the father of my unborn child
74802 it was badly needed as north carolina enters a situation where we dont have as much water as we used to and the demands are much greater
74803 we wanted to make the legislature as breast feeding friendly as possible
74804 this president is making it impossible for congress to do oversight of the intelligence community
74805 the only effective oversight that can be done is out of the executive branch and this is the fox guarding the chicken coop
74806 we have secret laws governing secret agencies that are engaging in secret spying against americans and theyre using our own tax dollars to do it this isnt keeping us safer its only making all americans suspects in the eyes of the government
74807 should allow ample time for a decision before the general election
74808 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
74809 adsense is quite literally the worst monetization service of all time for people who dont have millions of pageviews per month
74810 the decline in u s online recruitment activity during july is likely due in part to the seasonal summer slowdown that is typical of this time of year however the breadth and depth of the contraction in july also suggests further softness in the countrys underlying demand for labor
74811 while the financial real estate and construction sectors have been the most visible drag on the index in recent months the sharp drop in online recruitment within the support services sector during july suggests that the u s economic slowdown s beginning to have an even broader ripple effect
74812 we certainly understand and appreciate congresss concern for the well being of servicemembers and other u s personnel deployed in iraq but there seems to be a misperception out there that our facilities in that theater are replete with electrical hazards that have caused hundreds of fires and multiple fatalities
74813 whats more some seem to believe that this department and one of the army s lead logistical support contractors are so negligent or callous that we have failed to address these dangers
74814 we care far too much about our men and women in uniform as evidenced by the tens of billions of dollars we spend on force protection equipment to knowingly allow them to live or work in an unsafe environment
74815 our civilian and military leadership would simply not tolerate that
74816 but it is wrong to suggest that all these deaths were the result of shoddy workmanship by defense contractors or lack of oversight by the pentagon
74817 three more troops were killed while working with electrical generators that were not properly grounded
74818 the remaining four deaths do seem to stem from wiring problems but only one of them involves work done by kbr although the inspector general is still looking into all these incidents
74819 every facility our troops operate out of in iraq is undergoing a safety inspection
74820 it was the first time they appeared at the court and its said that their trial will start on august 7 we dont know yet whether defense lawyers have been arranged for them or not
74821 family members are normally contacted but we have not been contacted by anyone so far we are really worried about them
74822 this is where we wanted to be we just have to get further than we did last year now
74823 he wasnt throwing as hard as he usually does but his changeup was dropping pretty good
74824 we could have gotten out of that with one run if we make the right play at third or second and theyre out of the inning its a 1 0 ballgame the next thing you know its 4 0
74825 theyve got the killer instinct theres no doubt about that
74826 two outs nobody on and we end up scoring four thats disheartening to your opponent
74827 it looked like you got out of the inning clean theyve got some momentum humphrey had retired eight in a row at that point and pat strung together a good at bat and we strung together some big two out hits
74828 the number of pitchers ive always thought to win the state championship is six
74829 it was important to get ryan an inning here in the playoffs in this situation hes proven that he can pitch and in that situation he did exactly what we needed he threw strikes and let the guys play behind him
74830 jag har spelat desperat ett tag nu r jag uppgiven singel
74831 because everett is so bad at getting hits he couldnt even get a hit put on himself
74832 baby i know your lost and scared confide in me and youll find bad friends good times

74847 h uma s rie de informa es de conex es que entregamos ao governo brasileiro para que ele possa reagir como considerar mais apropriado
74848 doa es de amigos e um pr labore como secret rio do centro de estudos latino americanos numa salinha onde ele e outros tr s militantes preparam panfletos sobre a hist ria do continente distrubu dos a escolas carentes nas cidades sat lite da capital brasileira
74849 quem recebe o benef cio do ref gio tem que ficar na sombra
74850 devo atuar com cautela para n o facilitar ao inimigo argumentos que levem a questionar o ref gio nesse sentido ter conseguido o traslado da mona e da timbica explico mais adiante quem s o para a capital do pa s foi importante manterei esse baixo perfil at a neutraliza o obtida esta terei passaporte brasileiro e a primeira coisa que devo pensar em ir v los
74851 na segunda feira 15 a mona mona a mulher e timbica a filha do casal iniciou seu emprego novo e para assegur la ou fechar a passagem direita caso em algum momento queiram aborrec la ent o a deixaram na secretaria de pesca trabalhando no que chamam aqui de cargo de confian a ligado presid ncia da rep blica
74852 foi ele quem evitou que a narco guerrilha se aproximasse do governo lula
74853 poss vel que me visite um assessor especial de lula chamado silvino reck que junto com gilberto carvalho foi outro que nos ajudou bastante
74854 i thought you were going to stay with your mistress
74855 things have happened ive learned some truths and and i was hoping that your offer still stood for me to come with you
74856 i do need a guide someone to help me stay alive out here
74857 im sure it will take some getting used to for the both of us
74858 but no worries once we navigate our way back to the ship then i can throw together a remote transmitter to call for an evacuation ship to get us out of this place
74859 of course from down here we would most likely find interference
74860 but i do remember seeing a mountain not too far from where i landed so if we scale that there should be no problem
74861 after you were brought here from the rancor camp your ship was taken to a hanger in the village
74862 if you are to infiltrate the nightsister village the you shall need these
74863 i must admit these nightsisters dont get off world much
74864 you said that they have my ship in their village
74865 they are already searching for you and by now they will have been better equipped to deal with you
74866 there are some an elite guard that carry lightsabers like yours
74867 if you were to walk in there with knowing where the location of the hanger is then your life would be in peril i will slip in and secure the device of which you speak
74868 and if you discover my ship you will not know which device to bring
74869 but you said it yourself we need each other in this situation
74870 though many of your moves are predictable and your stance is full of holes you show great resourcefulness and improvisation that can turn the tide in a battle
74871 mistress trained me not only to be her slave but her bodyguard as well
74872 i was trained in several martial weapons four hours a day by lady evylinn
74873 evylinn may have been your weapons master but she died to quickly by my blade
74874 mistress bex would often confess that the title was merely an honorific mistress was the true warrior of the village but felt that she needed to allow the other to feel as if they belonged so later she could call upon them for favors
74875 blind the puppets with their own power so they cant see the strings of the puppet master i know the strategy well
74876 for two weeks you will train under me and better learn how to use that weapon of yours
74877 and to better learn how to use your most powerful weapon of all the force
74878 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of these moments we choose
74879 that was probably some of the best stuff ive had all year i was able to keep the ball down
74880 i dont know exactly how it all worked out but im happy it did
74881 hes going to bring another element to our offense its going to be a great addition i think everyones looking forward to getting him out there tomorrow and letting him do his thing
74882 youre not allowed much leeway when you pitch against a guy like webb
74883 you really have to pitch near perfect baseball to beat him thats always a good challenge but you know youve got to put up zeros the most frustrating thing was getting a one run lead and giving it back on 10 pitches
74884 the rest was my part thats the game right there

74887 i personally dont believe that any macro gives a player any real advantage over a non macro using player
74888 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
74889 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy
74890 i can definitely understand and relate maybe hell be next to me in an adjacent locker and we can chat and laugh about it
74891 i didnt want to leave there were we the only ones that have gone through it theres a track record i played with mo vaughn i played with roger clemens
74892 im going to green bay for brett favre straight up
74893 hes kind and hes friendly but leave him alone and let him play ball
74894 its what he was put on this earth to do dont interrupt his world
74895 what gets lost is how hard he works to excel at his craft his success is not an accident
74896 youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
74897 ive always wondered how we came to be ok with hes just not gonna play hard today and that was ok
74898 here is one example of what can be done with command links
74899 the beauty in these buttons is that they can also be as lengthy as you may need them to be
74900 is a command link with a shield icon rather than the default arrow
74901 look at that bum he doesnt even have a job
74902 one personal goal is stay healthy all year and play in every game
74903 thats my no 1 goal start all the games and stay healthy and finish the season strong and no more season ending injuries
74904 itd be a great thing to get him back out there so we can get our chemistry back together
74905 hes consistent hes very smart when it comes down to figuring out what the offense is trying to do
74906 and its just his attitude hes a wild man hes an animal hes got his long hair and his tattoos and hes amazing hell give us a boost
74907 our goal is to be the no 1 defense in the league lead the league in turnovers sacks pretty much every category
74908 if we all just take care of our own jobs were going to be really good
74909 i had a sprained ankle my sophomore year in high school
74910 i went a long time never missing any games or practice really
74911 its so different i dont like standing on the side but just talking to jerry angelo i feel like the clouds are breaking up and ive got blue skies in my future hopefully weve got all the injuries and the little nicks out of the way and i can get going
74912 his progress from last year to this year has been excellent weve noticed that hes playing with an awful lot of confidence and when youre out there as a corner thats an important part of playing that position
74913 last year when he first came to camp he had the leg injury and he kind of hobbled through it even throughout the season he had it in the spring and he hobbled throughout the season now hes completely healthy and hes a tough guy too hes a big corner that plays physical
74914 as a fan whenever brett favre is involved with something you take notice
74915 as a quarterback for the green bay packers you just think about the two times that you play him thats about my involvement with it
74916 it doesnt affect us we have our quarterbacks im not going to talk about somebody elses players
74917 yeah jeff why cant we not got to bed later we dont have the school in the morning
74918 so vitaley how would you like it if i took your video games and dvd player and let you stare at the wall all day tomorrow
74919 sorry youre right youre right i should not argue with the adults
74920 doctor his blood sugar would not be so high if he would stop sneaking those snickers bar hes hiding in his backpack
74921 the goal of one hope is to use the hope giving and life changing message of jesus christ to combat the cycles of racism prejudice abuse violence and poverty that exist in the inner city of tulsa and to train college aged men and women to replicate the one hope model in other urban areas

74924 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
74925 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
74926 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
74927 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
74928 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
74929 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
74930 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
74931 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
74932 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
74933 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
74934 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
74935 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
74936 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
74937 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence

74939 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
74940 i want a lot of fingerprints on this before we move forward so the people in that close vicinity have significant input on that park in their area
74941 were tending to be more a conservancy nature type of park
74942 what we are are attempting to do this fall is get some trails established get the beach area cleaned up and get some parking lots put in so we can start using that park
74943 its not a good thing but more peregrine falcons are hatching out every year
74944 birds are going to die its part of the natural process
74945 if this bird is anything like his father hes going to be long lived wise and be good at attracting another mate
74946 but i dont think he understood the magnitude of the whole thing hes still full of disbelief
74947 so i ran off with my bike for a week i liked it and decided to spend my summer riding
74948 id tell them we can talk for a half hour but ive got to go to bed then id wake up in the morning have breakfast and take off
74949 i got some farmland between me and the last bullet shells i saw on the ground
74950 one of the biggest things i got out of this was to be interested in other people
74951 when youre by yourself so much you learn to appreciate other people id get sick of talking about the trip so id ask people about their lives and get their stories
74952 we know this is a battleground state but if you go to green bay and talk to ted thompson and mike mccarthy and solve this dispute with brett favre im pretty sure you can carry wisconsin
74953 there are a lot of controversies i jumped into in my career but im not so dumb that im jumping into that one
74954 i will say brett favre has given america and wisconsin some of its greatest memories
74955 senator obama is an impressive speaker and people are attracted to the beauty of his words but on many issues big and small he is wrong and we disagree
74956 he says he wants to only tax the wealthy but he voted for tax hikes for people making 32 000 pretty much anything you can tax he wants to tax more
74957 we have to start drilling immediately off shore but obama says no we arent doing enough right now to break our dependency on middle east oil
74958 france gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power we need to find alternative energy instead of sending 700 billion to countries that dont like us with some of that money ending up in the hands of terrorist organizations
74959 it is the 31st of july and its very likely that we will have the lowest casualty rate since the war began
74960 i know every life is precious and every wound is grievous but the surge is working id much rather lose a political campaign than lose a war
74961 i hate war and i know that cost better than anyone
74962 im going to end this war but when i bring the troops home it will be from a secure and democratic iraq
74963 i support all choices whether thats faith based or all other choices
74964 the civil rights issue of the 20th century is education in america it all comes down to choice and competition whether its charters school vouchers choice schools or home schooling if thats what people want
74965 that microphone was brought to you from the democratic national party
74966 i want to thank you for your service to your country
74967 but earlier this year you said there would not be any mudslinging in your campaign and that seems to be what you are doing in your most recent ad where you compare britney spears and paris hilton to barack obama it seems to some americans that you might be flip floppoing and id like to know what you think of that
74968 were here because its a thrill to see the next president of the united states
74969 im hoping people wake up and form their own opinion because the news media has been so biased
74970 he has my support because we need him for the supreme court
74971 john paul stevens is very old and ruth bader ginsberg had cancer theyre both very liberal and i think theyre only staying on right now to see the outcome of the election
74972 im supporting him even though my parents are voting for barack obama i might have to yell at them
74973 ill make up my mind but it wont happen today
74974 im here because hes running for president but so far its a toss up
74975 first ill thank him for his service to his country and second ill ask what he thnks of obamas new stimulus plan
74976 i look at the choices i have and he shares my values
74977 i am 100 percent pro life and i completely support our efforts in the middle east we can let the press lose the war for our like vietnam or we can stay and do whats right and kick butt
74978 it does bother me a little bit and its something ive been in a lot of prayer about and god says to just pray for him
74979 if he would have been the president back in 2000 there wouldnt be one pass of pork he would have vetoed it
74980 hes got a real good chance of getting elected because he can pull in independent voters ive talked to democrats who like him and will vote for him hes honest hes not afraid to tell people washington is a mess and he would have enough power as president to use his veto and slow the mess down hes not afraid to work with other people who disagree and solve some differences
74981 i want to see history and this is history being made with him coming to racine
74982 i dont think hes going to win he doesnt have a chance because people really want change and thats what obama has but i want to hear him and see him
74983 this is going to be the battleground of battleground states
74984 bush didnt lose by much here in 2004 he took 52 percent of the vote in racine county and 47 percent in kenosha county senator mccain has the best chance of all the republicans to win because he appeals to the moderates and independent voters jobs
74985 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
74986 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
74987 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
74988 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
74989 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
74990 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
74991 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
74992 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
74993 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
74994 the voters we need to get are people not a whole unlike obama
74995 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
74996 are you better off now than you were four years ago
74997 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird

75002 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
75003 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
75004 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
75005 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
75006 that all persons coming into the united states from foreign countries shall be liable to detention and search
75007 loki was a hacker the other gods feared him but they needed his tools
75008 why didnt they develop the ps3 better before releasing it
75009 why did they release a console that was so underdeveloped
75010 why didnt they just release it 2 years later when games are better less bugged with better online functions better graphics functions and they wouldnt have fumbled with tons of missed game release dates

75014 god damn america then he needs to observe a very severe gym diet which keeps him from visiting wounded american soldiers in hospitals we understand that
75015 the council has taken this decision after both parties rejected options for a possible follow on presence put before them by the secretary general at the request of the security council
75016 her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels

75019 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
75020 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
75021 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
75022 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup

75024 is at this juncture in history the only vehicle through which progressives can both register their outrage at barack obama and begin the process of rebuilding a mass black led movement for real social change
75025 surely no one with a brain any longer believes that obama is a closet progressive or even a genuine liberal
75026 cynthia mckinneys campaign is the last opportunity to threaten obama with a backlash against his betrayals of progressive principles
75027 we have to bring the war in iraq to a respectable responsible and honorable end
75028 the u s should withdraw all troops and mercenaries from iraq in as orderly a fashion as possible
75029 this withdrawal should be quickly accomplished since the troops and the equipment were all pre positioned in the area to start with at the start of the invasion
75030 we need an end to all wars and occupations by u s forces including in iraq and afghanistan we need an immediate cessation of funding for war we need prosecution for all individuals guilty of violating the law including having committed or authorized crimes against humanity crimes against the peace torture or war crimes we need a complete renunciation of the pre emptive war doctrine we need an end to all wars and wars utility we need to dismantle the apparatus that implements schemes of regime change around the world and that instead assists in self determination of all peoples
75031 look i am a pro growth free market guy i love the market
75032 the u s should withdraw all troops and mercenaries from iraq in as orderly a fashion as possible says former georgia congresswoman cynthia mckinney
75033 politicians are always guilty of that and i dont exempt myself
75034 the practical effect of nafta is that it is an anti union policy
75035 why us unions would support a political party the democrats that has decisively contributed to their own demise is beyond me i support the international right to unionize my legislation the corporate responsibility act and the truth act sought to compel us corporations operating abroad to abide by u s labor environmental standards thereby lifting up workers in other parts of the world not exploiting them the reconstruction movement draft manifesto also calls for repeal of taft hartley to strengthen workers rights in this country
75036 we need to promote and enact laws for u s corporations that keep labor standards high at home and raise them abroad toward that end it is clear that we need a repeal of nafta cafta the caribbean fta and the u s peru fta and justice for immigrant workers including an end to the guest worker program riddled with abuses
75037 no one with a brain any longer believes that obama is a closet progressive or even a genuine liberal
75038 if you look at my positions and senator clintons theres not a lot of difference which is why its so easy for advisers senior advisers of senator clinton to support my candidacy
75039 the truth is that my foreign policy is actually a return to the traditional bipartisan realistic foreign policy of george bushs father john f kennedy of in some ways ronald reagan
75040 the united states should and must engage the world but not in empire not in military
75041 ninety percent of the us security budget is dedicated to some military engagement with the world
75042 the bush pelosi war policy is a formula for endless global conflict deterioration of the rule of law among nations and growing impoverishment indebtedness and evisceration of civil liberties at home
75043 predictable yet perilous mix of anti american rhetoric authoritarian government and checkbook diplomacy
75044 work to impede venezuela and bolivia from following the same path of failure that castro followed in cuba
75045 it is totally irresponsible to call hugo chavez an oil tyrant as published some time ago totally irresponsible to support the violation of the territorial integrity of ecuador a country that has signaled its desire to join the framework for peace and against destabilization by pulling out of the school of the americas i pledge untiring support for self determination in bolivia wracked now by a secessionist type autonomy movement probably fomented outside bolivias borders
75046 there will be situations that require the united states to work with its partners in africa to fight terrorism with lethal force having a unified command operating in africa will facilitate this action
75047 the mckinney campaign is the only vehicle through which progressives can both register their outrage at obama and begin the process of rebuilding a mass black led movement for real social change
75048 more than likely this force will be used in just the same way as plan colombia is used to police dissent and punish the innocent solely for pecuniary reasons the last thing africa needs is africom u s soldiers or a school of the americas type relationship with africa
75049 obama said he favors a congressional fact finding mission to haiti he said additional aid is needed there but it must come with strings attached to ensure it is used properly and not to line the pockets of politicians as happened in his fathers native kenya
75050 an invaluable resource for understanding the evolutionary record of earth over a geological time frame
75051 as some activists put it the tiniest boys and girls

75064 it took just a few months after the united states invasion of iraq for the world to find out that saddam hussein had long abandoned his nuclear biological and chemical weapons programs he was not training terrorists or colluding with al qaeda the only real threat he posed was to his own countrymen
75065 we cannot say with certainty whether mr bush lied about iraq but when the president withholds vital information from the public or leads them to believe things that he knows are not true to justify the invasion of another country that is bad enough
75066 thats bad dont do that again now eat your spinach

75097 after they made a deal they were following her to another motel room when they were approached by three males from behind and forced into a room at gunpoint
75098 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
75099 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
75100 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
75101 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
75102 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
75103 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
75104 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
75105 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
75106 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
75107 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
75108 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
75109 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
75110 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
75111 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
75112 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
75113 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
75114 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
75115 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
75116 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
75117 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
75118 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
75119 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
75120 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
75121 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
75122 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

75140 this new book is a worthy successor to lane kenworthys much acclaimed egalitarian capitalism combining academic rigor with a reader friendly style he explores how we might reconcile what many consider incompatible goals more employment and greater equality drawing on systematic and empirically rich analyses kenworthy argues against any simplistic policy formula the book makes especially lucrative reading when in the latter half it identifies the key ingredients of a win win strategy jobs with equality is destined to generate debate all the while that it affirms lane kenworthys status as a leading scholar of social inequality
75141 on the premise that high employment is essential to the realization of egalitarian goals in the contemporary era this important book explores how social policies and institutional arrangements in advanced capitalist societies have affected employment growth over the last three decades kenworthy synthesizes existing literature and presents new empirical findings based on original cross national data and measurements his most important contribution is to explore multiple determinants of employment performance and interactions among these determinants in systematic fashion very sensibly the analysis yields policy recommendations that are specific by institutional context for students of comparative political economy the particular questions that kenworthy addresses are now settled for some time to come
75142 once you get to earth orbit youre halfway to anywhere in the solar system
75143 they do pretty much everything well theyre fourth in the league in sacks and theyre second in the league in offense they make you stay patient offensively and they keep everything underneath
75144 we couldnt have done what we did had that great run without them thats for sure
75145 one of the things youve got to be able to do as a coach is handle different relationships and know how to motivate them its a really outstanding testament to emmitt
75146 i know all of us feel blessed to go in but to go in with those two young men that i had a chance to work with probably had some play in continuing my coaching career is the topping on all of it
75147 now im just looking forward to playing for the yankees and maybe i will play against detroit again in the playoffs
75148 theres a lot of controversies that i have eagerly leapt into in my time
75149 im not so dumb that im going to jump into that one
75150 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
75151 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
75152 on my first day in college i had a freshman history class and there must have been 1 000 people in there
75153 i had never seen so many people in one place and it was overwhelming
75154 ive always loved working with kids and teaching them the game
75155 and i have always felt strong about first tee and the values it teaches so this is a great fit
75156 i look at first tee as being an important part of the entire community and how by teaching these basic values we are helping the entire community for years to come
75157 when first tee was founded it had a mission statement of involving any kid not just disadvantaged or problem kids
75158 that message has been blurred a little bit and some people think first tee is only for certain kids when it is for any kid
75159 so id like to see us branch out to other facilities and work to apply our core values to a lot more kids
75160 there are a lot of good junior golf programs around town and we dont need to have turf wars over who is teaching kids its all about providing access to golf and teaching these values to as many kids as we can
75161 i love seeing the kids play here or kids with families but its a great course for anybody especially for those just learning the game
75162 sometimes when you hear a lot of negative things you start to think maybe theyre right and it changes your mentality and how you go about things
75163 as far as im concerned im as positive as i can be because i think the kid still has what it takes to be a pro bowl player
75164 the only thing that really bothered me is for people to say that im not a team player
75165 you can say whatever you want but dont question if i love my teammates or if i care for them
75166 i just have a new expectation of life things are totally different i am living a different way and i am really excited about this season
75167 i dont look at it that way hes not with me
75168 coaches were talking about him the other day hes doing any and everything asked of him and hes really got a good feel of what were trying to do
75169 i cant believe people would even fathom the thought as far as me getting softer
75170 people have been saying that im getting softer my love for the game is going i think that is foolish of people to say
75171 we feel that his versatility ability to handle the point guard duties and defensive strength will bolster our depth and provide us with additional options in our backcourt
75172 when i first met his father rod he asked me why i wanted his son
75173 i still have one to this day its not directed at anyone or any team but i have something to prove not to myself but to people who overlooked me
75174 he fought every day in practice every day in individual drills every day in the summer
75175 im high strung i have to control my temper when i see him ill apologize
75176 ive been on two teams that were mediocre i like the makeup of this team they have individuals who are selfless not selfish
75177 ive said all along if you are gonna be a top program you have to play the part
75178 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
75179 fantasy world that rivals anything walt disney could have created
75180 the reality is the us ethanol industry is producing both fuel and food
75181 i think the group that is assembled here reflects the fact that american voters understand the reality but only if we are all doing our jobs in telling our public policy makers to continue the investment in domestic and renewable fuels
75182 there is no good ethanol and bad ethanol its all better than petroleum
75183 my plea to you today is to work with us to move forward
75184 i want to hear ads in the state of florida that we should start our engines everyday with 100 percent all natural florida ethanol
75185 im feeling more comfortable reading the defenses a little faster getting the ball out of my hand making good throws
75186 ive come a long way definitely come a long way ive still got some work to go
75187 for the next couple years theres going to be stuff hes never seen were throwing a new offense at him were throwing new ideas at him so thats going to be a growing situation thatll go next year and the next year therell be a time he gets bored meeting with me but thats way down the line
75188 weve had sessions out here on the practice field where were working with those types of things and well continue to do that we have a pretty good idea of how people want to defend him and where the problems lie so we address them to make it easier on him
75189 overall childhood sexual abuse was more strongly associated with drug or alcohol dependence than with any of the psychiatric disorders
75190 only drug and alcohol dependence were significantly associated with all levels of abuse
75191 controlling for family factors and parental psychopathology produced a small change in some of the associations but the increased odds of reporting drug or alcohol dependence in adulthood after suffering sexual abuse as a child cant be explained by these background factors
75192 this study has particular significance because it is based on data from women in the general population
75193 numerous clinical studies have documented high rates of childhood sexual abuse among women in treatment this study the first to document it in a nonclinical population is particularly important in addressing questions concerning the relationship between sexual abuse and patterns of drug abuse and addiction
75194 in this business you can get surprised by technical complexities and when that happens we always support and work hard for the customer to a positive resolution
75195 playing in junior tournaments has been a lot of fun and ill miss it but im also looking forward to college
75196 i havent been playing too well lately and i probably would have been satisfied with a top 10 finish so this is pretty good
75197 it could have been a little better if a few more putts had gone in but everybody says that after every round
75198 the most efficient and effective exercise yet devised by man
75199 i think itd take some of the pressure off kids big time they lose a lot of sleep
75200 if theyre going to commit early they might as well sign em i think its a good idea and id say in august if its december youve already played through the season
75201 ut or lsu or a amp ms probably not going to want you either
75202 the weak dollar and rebates helped keep the economy shuffling along

75209 cualquier jugador siempre debe pensar en lo importante de ser convocado estar en la selecci n y ahora hay que poner en alto el nombre de m xico y monarcas creo que ya estamos maduros para enfrentar este tipo de responsabilidades compromisos y hay que enfrentarlos como tal
75210 high oil prices are taking their toll on western economies prices are now on a downward trend due to weaker u s economic data
75211 la verdad estoy contento de haber participado en el interescuadras fue muy complicado por la categor a de los jugadores que hay en primera divisi n pero estoy intentando hacer las cosas lo mejor posible con la gu a del profesor arce y todos mis compa eros
75212 s hoy lo hizo bien creo que va por buen camino tiene que trabajar mucho pero que bueno que est aqu con el puebla hoy los chavos de la segunda vinieron a hacer juego con nosotros y la verdad que lo vi muy bien
75213 es padre vivir de cerca los diferentes sentimientos y situaciones por las que pasa el equipo al final de todo se ve que joaqu n lo goza independientemente de que sean momentos buenos o momentos malos l siempre se entrega en cada partido y hay que reconocerle que como profesional da el 100 por ciento y hasta m s
75214 a luis siempre le gust el futbol yo cuando reci n llegu a puebla lo tra a desde muy chavo y hoy se le da la oportunidad de estar en segunda divisi n desde hace casi dos a os en los que ha ido llevando un proceso espero que lo aproveche
75215 mi meta es llegar a primera divisi n es la meta y sue o de todos lo que estamos en esa categor a y poder consolidarme en un equipo para hacer una larga carrera y por qu no aqu en el puebla que es donde se me est dando la oportunidad y donde mi hermano ha dejado una huella importante
75216 siempre son un cuadro dif cil y sta no va a ser la excepci n
75217 eso ya es relativo para ellos van a querer presentarse bien en su casa siempre son un cuadro dif cil y sta no va a ser la excepci n ya que todos los partidos y rivales son complicados
75218 con toda la seriedad con toda la humildad y el trabajo que nos lleva la semana lo enfrentamos para hacer un buen partido al fin todos queremos sumar en todos los aspectos
75219 motiva y te ayuda a estar m s concentrado porque se nos vienen dos competencias por eso es nuestra doble jornada y estamos muy contentos de poder tener partidos este fin de semana despu s el mi rcoles y luego el siguiente s bado
75220 en la vida es muy v lido que cada quien tenga su opini n mientras haya respeto
75221 para m el arranque del torneo creo que fue prometedor para nuestro equipo pero falta mucho hay que disputar los partidos cada semana y el nivel de la liga es alto y cada partido es a muerte ahora en la jornada 2 vamos de visitantes con necaxa y ojal podamos traernos un buen resultado
75222 siempre es dif cil incorporar a nueva gente m s en el futbol donde se necesita mucha coordinaci n mucho entendimiento no es f cil hacer un equipo de un d a para otro pero se est intentando y conforme han pasado los partidos de pretemporada y en el debut oficial se vio un equipo que ha ido avanzando
75223 en la vida es muy v lido que cada quien tenga su opini n mientras haya respeto no hay problema el hecho de no coincidir en algo no tiene nada de malo as son las democracias a lo mejor l henaine se molest como todos nos molestamos cuando algo no es como lo pensamos pero as es la vida
75224 no se ha dado la reuni n porque el se or henaine regres a los angeles a pasar sus vacaciones pero aqu seguimos trabajando yo no me he peleado con nadie porque para pelear se necesitan dos lo mejor ser sumar nuestras virtudes para que nuestra sociedad camine y lo que no sean virtudes tendremos que dejarlas afuera
75225 we dont like the fact that we allowed their fans to come into our park and have a four day party but thats our fault
75226 there was more pressure on just getting to the olympics
75227 all of the players knew and i told them we didnt make it in 04 so were going to make it this year
75228 youre representing an organization in the big leagues maybe a city maybe a state
75229 now youre representing all of those things every organization every state and city and you have that usa across your chest were the united states hope for a medal so its a challenge
75230 knowing we were so close makes us realize how good we can be
75231 were definitely moving the football program in the right direction
75232 we need more depth talent and speed but were moving in the right direction
75233 but one guy isnt going to be enough at any position for us to be any good
75234 weve got to find at least one or two other kids at running back that can come in that can give him a blow and change of pace maybe somebody that brings a little different element to the game than greg does
75235 but the accuracy factor is going to be more important than anything
75236 making sure that we make all the extra points and all the reasonable field goal attempts
75237 being out here just running and being in the huddle its just a great feeling to be out here in football instead of in rehab by myself
75238 jamelle is ahead because hes played and been around and went through the spring
75239 hes the no 1 guy and well go from there but nobody has the jersey plastered on their back anybody can win the job but hes on the top of the heap right now and well see how it goes
75240 it feels great to be out there with the team just be back into the routine
75241 it just feels great to be back out there with the guys again
75242 thank you madam mr president i simply cannot say enough about these great student athletes gathered here today they did exactly what every coach in this great country hopes his team will do they took em one at a time not a single person looked ahead to new hampshire they all gave 110 percent they overcame great adversity not to mention some of the most egg sucking officials you could imagine we were the only team in the world to beat the nittany lions the grizzly bears the fightin tigers the gulpin gators and the zany zebras during the course of a single schedule please accept and wear whenever possible especially if youre in front of a tv camera this beautiful jersey no 1 as a small token of our appreciation for your special interest in our great program and may god bless us all and the screamin eagles program which we like to think of as americas first team of football
75243 the bobcats and the entire charlotte community embraced me from day one
75244 its exciting to enter this season with a hall of fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning
75245 the quality of preparation the readiness of the venues and the attention to operational detail for these games have set a gold standard for the future
75246 sentiment is more focused on slowing demand rather than short term supply disruptions
75247 last year the rough here was almost out of control this year the rough is very average and its part of an experiment theyre doing theyre trying to see if the rough height has any effect on scoring
75248 im not saying its playing easy but the rough is not nearly as thick as it was last year
75249 you fall in love with a golf course when you have a setup thats as wonderful as this
75250 the greens are fast the pin placements are great the rough is challenging but fair and it lets you hit some recovery shots this year firestone is one of my favorite golf courses that we have on tour
75251 in addition well take mandatory five minute breaks every 20 to 30 minutes and we make them drink
75252 there will be guys at practice on friday who we havent seen this summer
75253 there is a reason we take it a little slow at first
75254 weve been going at 8 a m for much of the summer
75255 we try to get off the field before it gets extremely hot but we need to practice to get the players acclimated
75256 there will be plenty of water here but they need to drink lots of water before they get here
75257 well have a meal together and ill have a chance to meet the parents this is a fun way to start the season
75258 there is no breach of the hull no water getting in and no signs of any pollution
75259 but i guess ive vented that frustration and ive moved on
75260 i wish isaac well i wish he was here but ive got to work with the guys that we have
75261 ive been unable to make or receive calls on my mobile all morning
75262 after a 50 minute wait listening to the optus telephone on hold rubbish i was told by someone that service will be affecting quite a lot of melbournians at least till sic midday
75263 i am in sydney cbd and have not been able to do anything pretty much since this morning the network keeps coming on and off and when i have tried to sms or call it goes straight to no service
75264 the left handed stance needed on the right is my natural stance the left hand is my strong hand so i have a lot more moves and power available to that side
75265 looking back its not a secret that it was a disappointing year not only stats wise but even to my personal standards
75266 i did some self evaluating and i think i made the necessary adjustments as far as conditioning and getting ready to come back this year
75267 i feel a little stronger a little more powerful faster and quicker
75268 i was sick here in spartanburg for maybe two weeks
75269 i will say that i lost weight and a little bit of strength probably a little bit of explosiveness but throughout the season i wasnt sick at all
75270 mikes presence in the field and in the locker room will be missed
75271 i think ive been a part of this the longest of anybody on defense so i have a responsibility to lead in the right direction
75272 what ive learned over these last six years that ive been here is that year to year its unpredictable what happens with players and contracts right now im worried about playing football im not looking forward to the 2009 season or after that ive got to get focused on making it happen right now

75279 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us

75417 the neo8pdr does not have heavy voice coils spiders glue joints paper cones and surrounds so there is virtually nothing between the electrical signal and the sound just an almost weightless diaphragm hence these planar transducers do not have cone break up resonance with associated distortion phase incoherency or signal smearing that is common for conventional drivers this allows the neo8pdr to deliver clean airy transparent sound that is inherently natural and musically pleasing

75421 m s importante y m s meritorio la cantidad de empleos que se est n generando
75422 een heleboel mensen hadden tickets gekocht voor het volledige gebeuren dus niet alleen de avonden die rond onze succesvollere albums draaiden waren uitverkocht ik denk niet dat men kwam om de bekendere songs te horen want dit was een gelegenheid voor onze fans om dingen te horen die we nog nooit live gespeeld hadden en die we waarschijnlijk ook nooit meer zullen spelen
75423 het was een ongelooflijke gebeurtenis natuurlijk hadden we stress omdat het zeer moeilijk was om alle songs die we ooit opgenomen hebben opnieuw te leren spelen het heeft ons vier maanden repeteren gekost ik denk dat we iets verwezenlijkt hebben dat nooit zal worden nagedaan geen enkele andere band heeft daar de tijd of energie voor
75424 we gaan ons in de eerste plaats concentreren op de nieuwe plaat we doen wat festivals en later in het jaar volgt er een echte tournee maar ik denk niet dat we die eenentwintig albums nog eens integraal gaan spelen een aantal van die quasi vergeten songs zijn ons natuurlijk zo goed bevallen dat we ze in onze setlist gaan houden maar de nieuwe plaat is onze prioriteit
75425 cynisme is ons wat te gemakkelijk ron is gewoon goed in het bedenken van teksten die grappig lijken maar dat eigenlijk niet cht zijn she got me pregnant bijvoorbeeld lijkt leuk en frivool maar eigenlijk gaat het over het einde van een relatie er zit een donkere ondertoon in die tekst die je op het eerste gezicht misschien niet ziet
75426 in de eerste plaats is het natuurlijk een song vol clich matige zinnetjes die in het refrein plots omslaat en het tapijt van onder je voeten trekt maar als jij er in wil lezen dat we lachen om mensen die onze teksten ontleden dan is dat ook goed interessante ontleding haha
75427 we hebben een tijdje ge xperimenteerd met gesproken passages en veel ritme maar deze plaat is geschreven met mijn hoge stem als focus ik ben trouwens zeer blij dat ze zo goed ontvangen wordt want we hebben er met enorm veel liefde en oog voor detail aan gewerkt daarom hebben we ze gelanceerd met die eenentwintig shows om ze met een zo groots mogelijk gebaar voor te stellen
75428 vergeleken met negenennegentig procent van de muziek die uitgebracht wordt zijn wij misschien moeilijk of arty maar dat is omdat de meeste bands geen enkele ambitie hebben ze leggen zich neer bij de status quo en recyclen maar wat terwijl wij uitdagingen nooit uit de weg gaan eigenlijk vind ik dat wij popmuziek maken maar we veranderen onze aanpak niet zomaar om meer succes te hebben soms zitten de omstandigheden mee en scoren we een hit maar dat kan je nooit voorspellen onze grootste hit this town aint big enough for both of us was ook niet bepaald een gemakkelijk nummer
75429 ron en ik zijn enorm gemotiveerd en gepassioneerd ons gezamenlijk doel is sparks we werken daar constant aan en die passie verbindt ons ieder heeft ook duidelijk zijn rol binnen sparks dus van afgunst is er geen sprake wat wij doen is uniek en ik denk niet dat er veel mensen zijn die dezelfde drang hebben om de zaken zo aan te pakken ron en ik vullen elkaar perfect aan dat is onze kracht en dat zullen we met andere mensen nooit op dezelfde manier hebben
75430 dat is een mooie vergelijking er zijn inderdaad dingen die we niet eens tegen elkaar hoeven te zeggen we do n het gewoon
75431 a shifty talented winger with nothing but upside written all over him were trying to get younger and faster theres a certain chemistry weve been trying to build here for the past five years we were looking to make a deal for zherdev and fritsche before the management change there in columbus last year this deal sort of fell into our laps today but its something we were thinking about for a while though we never talked about who would go the other way

75434 theres a half dozen to a dozen news entities that are growing into global shoes
75435 they came to the right decision but they came to it slowly
75436 that is money that could have saved some of those jobs
75437 what were seeing is the systematic dismantling of one of the nations top newspaper companies the idea of bringing in new blood to the newspaper industry isnt a bad one because i think in a number of ways it does have old ways of thinking but when you bring in new blood those people have to bring in new strategies cutting pages and jobs isnt a strategy its just a way to cut costs which all newspaper companies are doing
75438 what happens in five years if it looks like more of the recruitment is coming through yahoos hotjobs said outsells doctor
75439 the core strength of a newspaper is its sales staff and its relationship to the advertiser said doctor
75440 if they can keep that relationship it doesnt matter what they are selling
75441 the synergies are real here if you put together the list of advertising clients cablevision has with the list of accounts newsday has and the combined contacts the sales teams have thats significant
75442 ive been skeptical but this really is a tremendous opportunity for them
75443 this is a permanent downsizing of newspaper companies said ken doctor
75444 theyre not using the word permanent but its a recognition that they will get much smaller as they try to find their way in a digital world
75445 its the end of the world as we know it
75446 the internet wont hurt our business and were making prudent investments in the internet
75447 the internet is changing our business but we believe our new internet revenues will make up for print losses

76134 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
76135 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
76136 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
76137 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
76138 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
76139 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
76140 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
76141 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
76142 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream

76169 i hope i dont dress like that when im her age
76170 here mom wear this tank instead and put this bracelet on
76171 carrie seriously come on this was out when we were in high school
76172 can be targeted by orally active drugs to enhance training or even to increase endurance without exercise
76173 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
76174 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
76175 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
76176 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
76177 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
76178 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
76179 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
76180 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
76181 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
76182 trade was great if i could find a stronger word than great i would use that
76183 while growth continues to be disappointing trade provides one of the few bright spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture raising questions about barack obamas policy of economic isolationism
76184 lets see how this works before we throw any more short term money at the economy
76185 nothing in todays gdp numbers was positive for families trying to find a job or pay to fill up their tank
76186 that is why we need a second 50 billion stimulus package that both relieves the burden on middle class families and helps to jump start job creation
76187 the consumer adds only 1 1 percentage point to overall growth and this is with a rebate check in hand
76188 gdp was net negative on the domestic front as we look to the second half of the year foreign growth is fading so u s exports are sure to slow also the rebate checks no longer are a factor meanwhile the housing sector is still a negative
76189 we have long held that the best measure of the economy most consumers interact with on a daily basis is final sales to domestic purchasers
76190 on this basis the economy has actually been weaker than it was in the last recession
76191 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
76192 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
76193 suspected candidates will be evaluated from their external appearances and then tickled until they giggle

76306 the hardest thing in baseball for a player is to get hurt
76307 when you get hurt thats it youre just not going to be the same player thats what happened to me it felt like it was one thing after another it was a very frustrating time
76308 when i was in baltimore i wanted to learn to play outfield because i know something can happen in triple a i played a lot of games in the outfield when i was back in the dominican i played a lot of games in the outfield i worked so hard in the winter i took ground balls i took fly balls in the outfield and im seeing the results right now when you work hard youre going to see the results
76309 its amazing the way i feel at the plate right now i thank god for the confidence
76310 since the break hes looking at more pitches and not unloading right away it gives him better rhythm and timing at the plate
76311 im just going to keep him playing as much as i can

76319 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage

76337 there are several false beliefs prevalent in our society regarding solar eclipse some people even lock themselves in their homes to avoid the bad rays from the eclipse
76338 i have been told that during an eclipse the number of germs increases therefore no food is eaten or cooked during the event and any food cooked before the eclipse is discarded
76339 solar eclipse is an interesting activity and should be watched under the supervision of experts with proper gadgets
76340 it is very important to emphasise that viewing the eclipse with naked eyes would be very dangerous for the eyes viewing the sun through a telescope or a binoculars without a proper filter is many times more dangerous do not ever do that it could destroy your eyesight
76341 by projection method a pinhole or small opening is used to cast the image of the sun on a screen placed a half meter or more beyond the opening
76342 if clouds permit a pinhole placed at the crosswires of the jai prakas instrument of the jantar mantar observatory would be used to trace the entire progress of the eclipse in the bowl of the instrument

76347 the iaea board will be considering a safeguards agreement which india has committed to adopt and in which india has said it will put the majority of its reactors under safeguarding them so that they cannot be used for military purposes the safeguards agreement is a standard agreement it was negotiated by the iaea experts legal and safeguards affairs it is a good sound agreement and we expect that the board of governors will approve it
76348 this is a technical matter we expect the board of governors will approve it as it has over a 100 per cent of the other safeguards agreements but it is an important safeguards agreement it is a step towards the decision by the nuclear suppliers group to allow nuclear co operation with india nuclear cooperation with india has three big benefits for all of us first off it is an opportunity to bring india into the non proliferation mainstream india has not only committed to a majority of its reactors under safeguards but also all future civil reactors under safeguards it has agreed to adopt the additional protocol which will give iaea additional access and insights into its civil nuclear program it has agreed to take a number of steps including strengthening its export control so this is a net plus for the non proliferation regime secondly it will help india address its growing energy needs one sixth of the worlds population lives in india and their energy requirements are growing astronomically today most of their energy comes from coal this is why india is becoming one of the greatest contributors to green house gasses if we can help india meet its energy requirements with nuclear that would make tremendous dent into the amount of green house gasses put into the earths atmosphere third it is also important because of the type of relationship that all of our countries have with india india is a large vibrant democracy it is force of stability in the region we are all developing different types of relationships with it but we all want stronger relationships with india ones based on co operation rather than on denial so we think this properly recognizes the role of india in the world and reflects the type of relation ships we have with it so yes it is a technical agreement but the political import is very high it will help strengthen the worlds non proliferation regime and will also help strengthen all of our relationships with india

76410 he came to us with his well known book the one he does for each of his films
76411 right from the get go he told me he wanted hellboy ii to appear like an animated picture with the cg characters we worked on looking larger than life he wanted to create a world that was very rich very textural so you could come back more than once and still see more detail going on in the background
76412 guillermo emphasized he wanted the puppets to look like real puppets and we spent loads of hours animating them
76413 the overall scope of the project and managing all of it simultaneously was one of the most challenging aspects and all that work was done on a fairly tight budget
76414 creating what looks like a much larger and more costly production

76424 this kind of common platform makes perfect sense as companies and government agencies do school districts and states should invest in ensuring that each of their locations has the same suite of online tools for their work and communications
76425 but school districts and states have been slow to invest at the level the scottish government has done for its schools for a nation of five million people the system cost 75 million and took four years to develop

76428 these would be difficult greens if they were at sea level
76429 the greens got a little crusty in the afternoon as far as they werent rolling real real smooth
76430 they were on the corners which makes it hard on this golf course because the rough is pretty deep around the greens and youve got the bunkers there
76431 it actually could have been i hate to say it it could have been a lot lower
76432 i think i could have shot a 61 or 62 out there
76433 its a little disappointing finishing with a bogey on 18 but you just get these little to use my name here funky lies in the first cut or in the rough
76434 usually i dont practice near that hard because you get worn out
76435 but this golf course you couldnt play it enough you need to learn it each day i learned a little more a little more and got a little more comfortable with it
76436 people tagging is a form of social bookmarking that enables people to organize their contacts into groups annotate them with terms supporting future recall and search for people by topic area
76437 people tagging has a valuable side benefit it enables the community to collectively maintain each others interest and expertise profiles
76438 people tag other people as a form of contact management and they confirm in subsequent interviews that the tags they have been given are accurate descriptions of their interest and expertise
76439 moreover none of the people reported offensive or inappropriate tags
76440 the goal for this page was to try and characterize or draw out trends in the people tagging space
76441 for example lets say a researcher gives a great talk on how
76442 i think the biggest take home here is that the greater population is able to benefit from a relatively smaller population of taggers
76443 this plays very well into the power law distribution of many social systems by making tags social in fringe not only does the tagger benefit but the community and taggee all benefit as well
76444 fringes main goal is to create a better more representative corporate directory
76445 it has been asked more than once why wouldnt beehive and fringe eventually merge i find this to be a very interesting prospect and may be the ultimately desirable state
76446 however both teams are still investigating really interesting problems from different perspectives
76447 we are continuing to aggregate from even more exotic sources than before

76529 the management of the island treated it like their own private atm
76530 for every rand received from tourism revenue r2 50 was paid to staff salary increases were in excess of inflation and salary increases to executive management were 259 between 2004 and 2007 general salaries increased by 29 between 2006 2007
76531 the process of managing the acquisition of the ferry was grossly mismanaged
76532 there is no audit trail reflecting the capitalisation of the rims most material asset
76533 the agreement between the rim and farocean for the construction of the ferry is overly skewed in favour of farocean we couldnt ascertain which attorneys drew up the contract and whether they were appointed by farocean or rim
76534 the rim keeps on saying that it doesnt have the money to pay me i believe it will though the expectations of the management were too optimistic when they ordered the boat just to get the plans okayed took six months
76535 the expected fuel consumption would be in the order of at most 1 500 litres of fuel yet on may 14 the boat refuelled with another 3 111 litres we believe that there is a strong inference that fuel was stolen siphoned off the ferry
76536 the employee gave out that he was sufficiently qualified and experienced to perform the assigned duties when he knew or should have known that he did not have the required qualifications and or experience
76537 i explained to robben island management that wed be non compliant we just dont have the people in australia who were disadvantaged by apartheid to do the work
76538 it was going to cost us r100 000 to get the tender
76539 i kept telling them they had the wrong boat anyway
76540 i gave them the option of two smaller ones with more passenger capacity for a lower price than i quoted in my tender
76541 it lasted half an hour and i flew back to australia on the last available flight before christmas
76542 i kept the drawings around here for a while but it made me so angry that one day i just took it and threw it in the bin ill never do business with robben island under the current management again
76543 its clear that top management of robben island museum rim have not fulfilled their mandate in the best interest of this national asset and world heritage site to the extent that rim is technically bankrupt
76544 in considering the matter cognisance must be taken of the principle of apportionment of blameworthiness to the extent that the ceo paul langa must be held more culpable than the coo denmark tungwana and the cfo nash masekwameng
76545 its deemed prudent that the council pass a resolution to approve the final report and charges and further that the ceo coo and cfo be given the option to resign with immediate effect in lieu of being charged and facing a disciplinary hearing on conclusion of which the likely sanction would be dismissal
76546 the exercise of this option will spare rim and the department of arts and culture adverse publicity and also spare the ceo coo and cfo the ignominy of being charged and subjected to the humiliation of a disciplinary hearing
76547 although the rim top management advanced a multitude of reasons for the r25 million deficit it must be conceded that the top management failed dismally to provide the requisite leadership and sound financial management necessary to maintain rim as a declared cultural institution and world heritage site
76548 the department had a meeting on 25 june 2008 with michael leaser a regional head of the special investigation unit of the western cape in order to discuss the matter of further allegations made by a member of staff of rim including allegations of tender irregularities financial mismanagement and other aspects
76549 its anticipated that the department will receive this information within the next few days and its envisaged that this information will be passed on to forensic audit firm orca to further investigate
76550 currently rim is facing litigation in the region of about r3 million in respect to photocopies that were procured without following the necessary procurement process

76571 i recently purchased a 3 year membership for my family from air evac lifeteam what happens to the citizens who have purchased a 3 year membership are involved in a bad wreck and cant tell the emts they are an air evac lifeteam member
76572 if a person is in a bad wreck the local emts are trained to look for a sticker or try and ascertain if the person has a membership
76573 we encourage people to put the stickers on their vehicle and the emts will do their best to call the appropriate service the main thing i can tell you is that if you have a membership with us you will not pay to fly with us
76574 one of the biggest misconceptions i have been addressing is that people believe that because prmc has chosen to partner with us that the patient will be forced to fly with airlife even if they have a membership elsewhere
76575 the patient determines by which mode they wish to travel based on recommendations of the health care professionals caring for them
76576 they are not paying for our services nor do we pay them for the privilege of serving the community
76577 all of the employees that work at this air evac lifeteam base are local
76578 we are investing money at the airport and all local levels to give back to the community i personally take pride in that because we are locals helping locals

76584 at what cost egregious price increases in the pharmaceutical drug industry
76585 not for a groundbreaking new drug but rather was for a drug that was put on the market in the 1960s
76586 that certain drug products have experienced extraordinary price increases that are well beyond what would normally be expected in a competitive market
76587 pharmaceutical market is extremely complex and vexing to most observers
76588 unique position in a market with respect to intellectual property legal status barriers to entry or product features that offer a competitive advantage
76589 t he number and magnitude of these extraordinary price increases also raises the possibility that antitrust issues may be present

76593 stanley feld has been doing a series on why physicians are slow to adopt electronic records the common perception is that they are expensive or ludditic doctors are desperate to cling to paper charts the main problem is that the current crop of ehrs are simply not ready for prime time i recently read a story where doctors have their staff print out a patients electronic record for every encounter then handwrite a note and have the staff scan it back into the computer

76608 it thrilled my heart to see them pray to receive christ
76609 wed been sitting there visiting all morning going through the tract and for the first time they saw the scripture in their own language we established a bond and now we are sisters in christ
76610 we planned everything so that we could retire at 55 to do volunteer missions
76611 we actually thought at first god wanted us to go as full time missionaries through the foreign mission board now international mission board but he showed us quickly that was not to be the case instead he was calling us to serve through short term missions
76612 i am fully convinced that every person created by god should have the opportunity to hear the gospel and respond yes or no
76613 in order to do that someone has to go and tell we are simply trying to be obedient to what the lord has called us to do
76614 i confess that when i first saw mussa and the mama i did not think they were going to make it well
76615 but they did and they were a testimony to the people one older man said he could not come to the gathering to hear the gospel preached and then he saw the mama walking from hut to hut sharing the gospel and he got up and went one day we all stopped for lunch but the mussa never came back to eat he kept sharing the gospel this is a great example to us
76616 it has been awesome to be on this trip and to share this experience with them they have such a love for the lord and ive learned a lot just being with them papaw always has some word of wisdom hes sharing with me
76617 i would say to retired people dont retire just move on to what god has called you to do next
76618 if you are still living and breathing you are a missionary you dont have to go overseas to be a missionary but if you do god will provide the resources and if he calls go dont hesitate go do it
76619 throughout southeast asia there are many pockets of folks serving with the international mission board and other mission agencies
76620 it really became a desire of my heart to minister to the women living in the surrounding areas since they give so much of their time doing ministry for others
76621 rest isnt an absence of activity but a state of completion and satisfaction
76622 rest is what we sought to bring to all the women we ministered to
76623 more than two years ago when ann cretin and i joined hearts and minds we sought the lord for what type of team he wanted to raise up for this sort of ministry outreach
76624 we needed a team called to go but with specific gifts and talents that could contribute to the workshops each team member was personally invited into this endeavor
76625 the team committed themselves wholeheartedly and many testified to the reality that it became more about what god was doing in them than what he was doing through them
76626 it was amazing to see each member of the team use talents that perhaps they never imagined could be used in a ministry setting and really make an impact in the lives of women at the retreat
76627 it was so humbling to be able to speak into these womens lives and tell them how beautiful they are and how beautiful they are to god
76628 the lord really showed me that anyone can be used overseas
76629 those who came to lead poured so much of his love into me
76630 god used mary kassian mightily for all of us women who went
76631 it was truly a whole event whole in worship in encouragement in truth in ministry whole in everything that jesus is and i feel renewed encouraged and courageous
76632 oh my god what if the cool kids dont like me
76633 the global economic outlook is deteriorating and corporate earnings are also getting worse together they are creating selling pressure
76634 this is how the acholi women express great enthusiasm for the lord
76635 it would be like shouting hallelujah these women are very excited that someone came and shared jesus with them and they believed he is now their savior
76636 many people lost their lives and land it unsettled hearts as they resettle our desire is that each of them would have a local church
76637 the expression and the joy on the face of one of the girls when she accepted christ will always stay with me
76638 ive never seen anything like it this trip has shown me again how great god is
76639 there is a lot of spiritual oppression in the places we were working
76640 theres really nothing you can offer these people except the hope of jesus christ god is showing me that i must walk with him every step of the way if im going to effectively be used by him to bring that message of hope
76641 it has impressed upon me again that jesus christ is our only hope

76643 as we are facing difficulty with the direction of the economy including rising raw material prices although there are relatively few japan led factors we need to address this issue

76736 well something second the other two stories reprinted below about teachers only underscore the obvious
76737 allegations of such abuse should be thoroughly investigated by school districts and if the allegations are substantiated the media may request records containing the identity of the perpetrating teacher
76738 but the most unfortunate consequence and one that is completely unacceptable is that if predatory teachers are undetected children will continue to suffer at their hands
76739 mere fact of the allegation of sexual misconduct toward a minor may hold the teacher up to hatred and ridicule in the community without any evidence that such misconduct ever occurred
76740 under our holding the public can access documents related to the allegations and investigations subject to redactions thus maintaining the citizens ability to inform themselves about school district operations
76741 concerning the teachers private lives and are not specific incidents of misconduct during the course of employment
76742 the material in a teachers file relating to allegations of sexual misconduct involving students is not information that is protected by the right of privacy
76743 it does not pertain to the intimate details of ones personal and private life but is instead information about alleged specific instances of misconduct occurring in the course of the teachers performance of his or her public duties a kind of information that this court has specifically identified as not encompassed by the right of privacy
76744 where a letter simply seeks to guide future conduct does not mention substantiated misconduct and a teacher is not disciplined or subject to any restriction the name and identifying information of the teacher should be redacted
76745 this result protects both the public interest in overseeing school districts responses to allegations letters of direction give citizens a complete picture of a school districts investigations and accompanying procedures and the teachers individual privacy rights
76746 its going to come down to the little things like squares and circles and double triple and so on

76749 there was one town in ethiopia we pulled into and this guy came up and he went you are an actor actor films films

76751 she kind of thought that at least she didnt have to worry about me i was mainly wearing makeup for a living and then suddenly i went oh mom im riding my bike around the world and she goes oh my god what did i do to deserve all of this worry they know that i love it and that it is enriching

76783 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
76784 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
76785 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
76786 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live

76788 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
76789 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

76806 and it threatens to unravel the only path to success that weve had to this point

76808 are place names in some countries also words associated with a place used to identify products that come from these places and have specific characteristics
76809 that we would like to demonstrate our willingness a global willingness in these discussions that means we want geographical indications included in there
76810 its not just france we are fighting for its champagne
76811 we wanted to offer some other event fully based on the dogs
76812 we have a lot of people in the community who have dogs and a lot of people who belong to our dog park
76813 i think its important to have in the community because we do have a lot of dog lovers and its a good place to go to find out more information
76814 i think itll just be a fun and informative afternoon
76815 as well as the amount of vendors we have represented
76816 theyve taken out some of the more inappropriate language but its still the same story and all of the same songs
76817 but the overall message and all of the characters are pretty much intact as it was when it ran on broadway
76818 so we not only love the show but a large part of the subject matter is something we identify with
76819 and we are passionate about representing as authentically as we can
76820 i love it rent is one of my all time favorite musicals
76821 its why i started getting involved in theater so i cant believe im playing one of the parts in the show
76822 shes kind of like an anarchist shes crazy and wild and very different from me but thats what makes it so challenging

76824 at numerous times ive written donate back on tickets ive bought
76825 ive always looked at it as being a good cause
76826 hes just a genuinely nice person in any way you deal with him
76827 he does so much to help out organizations in the community and he doesnt want recognition
76828 i enjoy helping i think that brings joy to all of us when we can help when you do its a good feeling
76829 when you think about it its a pretty cool thing
76830 but i think itd be neat if that would happen more often it would be nice if this inspired others to do it
76831 the new web site doesnt add any new information it just organizes the information in a different way
76832 we want to try to get as much information out as possible
76833 growing up in our neighborhood in the early 60s was awesome
76834 after a long summers day of swimming my mom would open the front door and yell candy scramble and all the kids from the block would come running as my mom threw handfuls of candy
76835 so she would baby sit for the neighborhood and firemens kids she baby sat for hundreds of children over the years and later many of them brought their children to her as well
76836 the children were like my own and all have come back to see me through the years
76837 id have hot dog days popsicle days and watermelon days too
76838 she watches my two younger girls and my sisters 9 month old grandson jimmy i call my mom the pied piper of hoffman because she always had kids around her and still does even at the age of 90
76839 nicknamed fast freddie for the simple reason that in his prime few professional racers could surpass him pedal stroke for pedal stroke once speeds exceed 40 mph the ones who could were the ones who went on to win sprints at the tour de france and other big races look for him to launch a rock teammate or try to take the win for himself
76840 generally considered one of the savviest and most strategical cyclists in the world not just the u s who has been able to ride far beyond his physical talent by using his brain as much as his legs
76841 probably the fastest man racing in america right now his genetics and training have combined in that rare peak that lets racers bottle lightning the problem is that holding onto the lightning is notoriously difficult will he fry the rest of the field before he burns himself out
76842 when he raced in europe and was one of the top riders in the world hamilton was considered one of the nicest pros ever to grace the pack a drug scandal a ban and a revived career later the olympic medalist finds himself branded as one of rock racings bad boys love him for his tenacity or hate him for his purported drug use either way you have to admit hes a fascinating character
76843 i believe if im going to bring something into my classroom and teach it to my kids im going to do it the right way by getting hands on first
76844 i became passionate with the story because it was so local i brought it into the classroom and had a blast explaining to my students how this ice age mammal was found 15 minutes away so they thought that was cool
76845 then the great find happened here in 2005 and brought back the same excitement
76846 every student in anns class for the past 10 years just hangs on every word she says
76847 thats just her ability to relate to the students so whenever we have an exciting project with the forest preserve i know her class will be interested because ann is interested
76848 there are so many wetlands throughout the county and state and they are all candidates to have housed mastodons and mammoths
76849 so its a crapshoot most ancient elephants are found during restoration work for other projects
76850 if those teeth hadnt been found theres no way anyone would have found the rest of this
76851 this would have all been the middle of nowhere the ones that we do find were lucky to find them
76852 we dont really study the ice age in school which is what makes this opportunity unique
76853 we get dirty but its well worth it especially if we find a skeleton
76854 he was an outgoing friendly guy who knew everyone in the community
76855 i never saw him treat anyone with anything but respect and dignity he was just a good decent guy
76856 they did building searches and tracking judge would blow in jerrys ear to wake him up when it was time to go work except that he didnt understand when it was vacation time
76857 he was that kind of guy he was concerned about the well being of his own family but that extended to his police family as well
76858 he was a guy you could go to with questions about the job
76859 he had a lot of institutional knowledge with what had done on in the department that you couldnt read in a book
76860 youre going to see a lot of bumping jostling for position and crashes
76861 you can sit there and have your cup of coffee
76862 the rider in front isnt likely the one who wins
76863 hes the one strategically protecting his team leader behind him
76864 the better guys will work with their teammates and work behind them so their legs stay fresh and then they break away
76865 youre going to see a bunch of people riding together you may see someone break away the big question is will they be able to stay away you usually see them try to break away in groups and get swallowed up at the front and spit out in the back
76866 always the loudest always the happiest always the last to leave he never wanted these times to end
76867 he prided himself on building not just homes but neighborhoods and communities
76868 it was an expression of davids belief in our country that no city should be abandoned none of americas people should be expendable

76871 the primary reason for having the observatory is because of the size of our telescope which has to be permanently managed on a site
76872 the lakesky observatory would provide us with the opportunity not only to house our telescope but to further expand our public and educational outreach concerning the subject of astronomy
76873 that means we have to consider parking bathrooms security options and the overall interest of the local community in the location
76874 we are flexible building our observatory in lake county would be nice for location however it is very light polluted
76875 the typical star party would probably feature the lakesky 20 and a few other scopes pointed at interesting things in the sky
76876 to raise the funds we would need to spend a lot of time getting money through fundraisers
76877 our best bet would be getting support from corporate sponsors and contributors
76878 we will continue to actively pursue and negotiate sites for our intended observatory
76879 its a way to make history more real to them and make people aware about how their community was founded
76880 if we can contribute in any way to the training of prosecutors that is definitely our goal
76881 the greater emphasis we place on aggressive dui prosecution the fewer lives we lose on the highways
76882 with so many users our bandwidth is somewhere in the 90 percent usage range
76883 to branch out a little bit and do things collaboratively
76884 by combining our resources were able to make more programming available
76885 beyond that i think the books are really interesting and are going to expose a lot more people to hispanic culture
76886 i hope this is an idea that takes root and grows
76887 i think this is a great idea and im delighted to participate i hope it raises awareness for people that reading is important and vital to any community
76888 steve was a committed father and a tremendous asset to the company
76889 weve been focusing on the english language learners program these past few years
76890 not an us and them type of education the bigger picture of it is that it brings the community together
76891 having fun learning the more were different the more were the same
76892 diversity is just another way of say how we all contribute to one another
76893 i dont know if surprised is the right word but im very disappointed
76894 i was hoping it would lead to a favorable result for us
76895 we hoped this sale would go through and it didnt
76896 but we arent starting from square one there are options on the table for the board to consider
76897 those are just a couple of options and the board is reviewing all alternatives for the site
76898 if thats high usually your registration will be high overall
76899 village administration is in discussions with the affected unions and theyre working on that now
76900 were seeing this countywide where employees are being laid off
76901 its terrible if it wasnt for this economy we wouldnt be having this discussion
76902 it certainly is an issue nobody wants to start with a deficit next year
76903 the issue is that retail sales tax is down so much and youre not getting developer impact fees because projects have stopped essentially
76904 its no secret that we get a lot of complaints in there and we are using national night out to send a clear message
76905 the message is the neighborhood and police department have organized and we will fight back
76906 we have been a part of this event and are maintaining the tradition that was started in the past
76907 its also a great way to create relationships between the community and the police force
76908 rich 40 year history of doing well for the community
76909 but it also seems like a time when they need some new people
76910 my goal is much broader than that to help get the park district going in the right direction
76911 i think that gives me a unique perspective as to what longtime residents are looking for
76912 im also acutely aware of what new families are moving to naperville for and what they expect from the community
76913 i currently have no burning issues relative to the park district other than to see it run successfully and force some team building among board members
76914 but we must if we are going to keep our economy vibrant
76915 its a collection of the same uninspired and uninspiring policies that this administration has offered over the past five years toll it privatize it lease it sell it or congestion price it
76916 he was a personable guy he wanted to take care of the people who lived there
76917 it gives us more contact with southern and western states
76918 we dont agree with it the ruling and we will seek a court review
76919 most of it is going to be tied in one way or another to the 50th anniversary music that was popular in 1958
76920 its a great way to cool off on a hot sunday
76921 its an old roof built in 1987 with a 15 year life expectancy
76922 i find the timing of this to be very interesting
76923 i think it deprives me of my right and freedom of choice
76924 im really afraid that were going to have inexperienced people
76925 president stroger has made it clear that there is no room for corruption or fraud in county government upon learning of allegations of misconduct at provident hospital the administration took swift action and suspended three individuals suspected of involvement in illegal activity
76926 if these allegations turn out to be true its just further evidence that theres no serious management oversight of county government this is the first place that you would think president stroger would be watching over given the history

77138 there wont be a day in my life when i wont be thinking about microsoft the great things that were doing and wanting to help
77139 so your blog which had remained untouched for a long time now sports a saying that you are sorry but it will remain untouched for awhile longer
77140 any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both
77141 well if youve got a slowing economy coming off the back of the highest inflation rate in 16 years and 12 interest rate rises in a row then the flow through to growth in the economy and the flow through to employment one just follows the other
77142 i believe that we have a strong policy course of action to see this economy through we are in the best position in a better position than most other economies in the western world given our strong budgetary position the independence of our reserve bank and as well as a clear strategy of economic reform
77143 it will be tough we are not immune from the global economy but i believe weve got strong policy settings for the future
77144 aucune certitude que les discussions conduiraient une offre pour british energy
77145 i think it says a lot about the unselfishness that we have on this team
77146 they all know that another guy means potentially less time for them to play but no ones worried about losing that extra inning or that extra at bat if it means him getting on the field
77147 im glad that they kept me on the team even though i havent been able to play
77148 theyve been real good at supporting me and keeping me up and ive done a pretty good job of keeping them ready to play and keeping them going during the games
77149 substance abuse is particularly devastating when it afflicts young people because they are the communitys future
77150 i didnt know what an addict was much less that i was one
77151 i was a functional addict i received good grades in school and maintained two jobs but it got to the point where i was suicidal thats when i approached my parents and they brought me to memorial hermanns center
77152 when you remember that 84 000 drug abusers and 99 000 alcohol abusers arent getting the treatment they need 68 beds for teens wont go a long way
77153 the real problem is that the number of beds funded by the federal and state government dont begin to meet the need
77154 our energy policy is essentially nonexistent which looks like its been pretty good to houston
77155 but even those in the energy business here in houston will tell you its not sustainable over the long run
77156 is that your idea of a serious policy debate its intellectually bankrupt that agenda so our job is to make sure we resist getting pulled into that nonsense
77157 climate change is real and houston you cannot afford to get any hotter
77158 texas doesnt shy away from big challenges texas likes big
77159 the power to bargain for higher wages a power that we assume was dismantled may not be so feeble
77160 real wages adjusted for inflation are falling and there is no sign at all of any change in direction
77161 i am concerned that at some point they will have to be accommodated because they cant afford the rising costs of gasoline food utilities
77162 and they cant resort to automatic cost of living adjustments or union power theyll find some other way through their demands on the political process and through their expectations
77163 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
77164 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation

77166 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
77167 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
77168 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgeon of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
77169 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
77170 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
77171 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
77172 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
77173 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
77174 they tell us they want to do more domestic production
77175 they tell us they need to drill offshore they tell us that they can find oil on the mainland and what do they do with their profits they buy back stock simply to increase their share price
77176 they had talked about growing production about 1 percent a year but im not sure theyre going to hit that this year
77177 we are demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our shareholders
77178 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
77179 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

77189 it was a song that was really therapeutic for me to get me through probably one of the most traumatic and traumatizing experiences in my life and i said im not putting it on the album because its for me
77190 im absolutely enjoying the success that weve experienced but at the same token im very thankful that this happened when i was old enough to handle it
77191 it gives me the opportunity to take the notoriety and the acclaim that ive received from this project and posture it and position it so that i can help to educate children in our urban community

77199 the united states abstained from the vote because language added to the resolution would send the wrong signal to sudanese president bashir and undermine efforts to bring him and others to justice
77200 no one will be immune from its catastrophic consequences the whole of sudan and the entire region
77201 due to the fact that we have now had three known incidents of shop lifting involving the one coloured girl plus friends who has come in with two or three others coloureds sic
77202 if any group of aboriginals mixed or otherwise comes into the shop you will ask them to leave this does not include any customers of a long term basis say to them they are not be allowed in sic but can come in individually if they are willing to be searched on their way out
77203 if they ask why it is because of a recent spate of shoplifting involving people of their appearance if they start yelling or otherwise call the police
77204 a full blood her skin was whatever you want to call it chocolate or something
77205 i had a very angry reaction to the shoplifting and spoke to staff and gave them that memo and we had a meeting afterwards and it wasnt enforced
77206 i realise that the words i used were totally inappropriate as a sponsor of the local community where over 2 per cent of our of our net profit goes towards supporting all of the major sporting clubs schools and various groups and activities in the community i apologise sincerely to anyone affected by the memo
77207 if it had been maybe we would have to reconsider it
77208 i was surprised to see the existence of a document such as that in the public domain but ive got no doubt it happens in other workplaces

77232 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
77233 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
77234 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
77235 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

77240 hi dave great points succinctly put indeed ive recently said much the same on
77241 i already knew that intel the company ive worked for the last 12 years was
77242 id love to be able to take credit for it but i dont think weve innovated too significantly i think you might even call it a happy accident
77243 climate change is likely to result in hotter drier summers and warmer wetter winters perversely this means we will suffer from having both more water and less with greater risk from flooding and drought
77244 taken separately all the impacts are harmful but taken together they could ultimately destroy an internationally important river system policies must therefore be developed that can address droughts floods pollution and climate change simultaneously rather than treating each in isolation
77245 population growth will place further pressure on our already stressed water supplies we now need to take action to reduce the amount of water each person wastes lower leakage and reduce pollution
77246 increasing awareness and understanding of the issues which will face us all as a result of climate change is a vital objective of our partnership
77247 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
77248 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

77258 the rest of the world will learn what we already know melbourne and regional victoria have some of the best food and wine in the world
77259 the festival also provides the platform to showcase victorias food and wine to key trade representatives and buyers which has the potential to increase our export markets
77260 melbournes food industry offers some of the worlds greatest cuisines and food and wine professionals so it is only fitting that we are represented at the worlds biggest international food and wine festival
77261 i look forward to representing melbourne at the 13th annual epcot international food amp wine festival and promoting our rich food culture to an international audience

77285 in the town i am from everyone is very critical of one another the neighbourhood is rife with gossip its a really negative place to live and im glad to be leaving it its not a very nice place to live at all
77286 you know what this town is just like that too
77287 what about the town you are from what sort of place is that
77288 im from a lovely town everyone there is really close and always willing to help their neighbours out with whatever needs doing theres always a cheery hello and thank you everywhere you go i really hate leaving it actually it feels almost as if we are leaving a family
77289 how come when the first man asked you you told him that our town was a terrible place to live and when the second man asked you you told him that our town was a wonderful place to live
77290 no matter where you live or move to you take your own attitude with you and thats what makes the place you live either terrible or wonderful

77302 climate model simulations are unable to replicate such cold tropical conditions for this time period
77303 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
77304 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
77305 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
77306 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes
77307 this calls into question traditional assumptions of long lasting equatorial warmth in the late paleozoic and raises the possibility of large scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time

77318 the legacies and contributions of this years inductees will now live forever as they join our countrys greatest olympians in the u s olympic hall of fame
77319 as a sponsor of the hall of fame since its celebrated revitalization in 2004 allstate is proud to help protect and preserve this important part of our identity and source of american pride
77320 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
77321 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing baseball betting workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
77322 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these baseball betting workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
77323 is one that likes what they do how they do it and why they do it nothing is more important in the baseball betting industry than these things and i can speak for my company when i say that establishing these values in the office boosts results tremendously
77324 most baseball betting companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
77325 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
77326 our baseball betting company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
77327 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
77328 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company
77329 seven ways to increase productivity in the baseball betting business
77330 if you tell someone in the baseball betting field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department
77331 ive been working in the baseball betting field for years now and just expanded my operations to the internet sales have doubled in no time
77332 there are five essential points in this baseball betting study that are key
77333 every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit

77340 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
77341 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
77342 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
77343 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
77344 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
77345 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits

77534 i have always opposed the lambridge park and ride scheme it would have cost a fortune done nothing to reduce congestion and pollution on the london road and would in effect be a city centre car park im delighted the council has been prepared to think again
77535 after 20 years of discussions and consultation and after the previous conservative member in charge of transport wasted 4 of those years trying to force through an ill thought out scheme at lambridge i am pleased that the current cabinet member has seen the light
77536 this change of heart is a victory for local residents in lambridge and london road who have consistently opposed the lambridge site were it not for their opposition the lambridge park and ride would have already been built
77537 until this announcement the cabinet had been taking the line that no changes were possible to the bath transport package or the council risked being sent to the back of the queue for funding
77538 now the executive has decided its possible to change one end of the route lets hope they will now turn their attention to the other end surely the huge outcry about the proposed route of the western end of the bus rapid transit scheme deserves as much of the councils attention as the outcry about the lambridge park and ride

77546 he is capable of racing at the front but he needs to do it well to give the others a chance and to get the wsb teams to believe bsb guys can compete at this level
77547 in wsb people like bayliss noriyuki haga carlos checa and others are all verging on retirement so this is a critical point for the series

77562 stanley feld has been doing a series on why physicians are slow to adopt electronic records the common perception is that they are expensive or ludditic doctors are desperate to cling to paper charts the main problem is that the current crop of ehrs are simply not ready for prime time i recently read a story where doctors have their staff print out a patients electronic record for every encounter then handwrite a note and have the staff scan it back into the computer

77607 its a real hardship im just stressed thinking about it

77612 after this first big jump the annual increases will be much smaller

77651 im all for making a profit its the american way but its another thing to gouge
77652 they are showing they are able to control expenses even in this environment
77653 overall given how difficult a quarter it was from a macroeconomic standpoint i think they weathered the environment very well
77654 we continue to believe there will come a time when it makes sense to be growing and looking at starting acquisitions once again
77655 it will be a slog for the economy for the next six to 12 months the recession may be over but it wont feel good until this time next year
77656 while we expect domestic demand to remain weak going forward stabilizing inventories will likely provide some positive offset in the second half of the year
77657 we have long held that the best measure of the economy most consumers interact with on a daily basis is final sales to domestic purchasers on this basis the economy has actually been weaker than it was in the last recession
77658 people will continue spending the stimulus checks in the third quarter and the fourth quarter that should encourage manufacturers and replenish those stocks
77659 executed very well it was very timely thats what these numbers tell me that in spite of the increases in energy prices
77660 the gdp revisions show the economy is continuing to operate at a level just slightly better than what we would see in an outright recession
77661 growth is narrowly focused however with most of the improvement coming from net exports
77662 is a bad deal for duke ratepayers but it is a great deal for stockholders in the company
77663 do you want to be the one state in the u s that ends up with a cost thats a lot higher than whats being paid elsewhere
77664 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
77665 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system
77666 its not down but its marginally up in the low single digits our debit card spending on the other hand has continued to grow and is very robust
77667 needs leadership it needs to grow it needs to reduce costs it needs to look at strategic industry partners

77670 it could become unsafe for all vessels let alone a vessel of 24 metres in size
77671 the channel is getting so narrow now that two vessels cant pass in the channel so one vessel has to stop

77673 we contract private buses out in places like ormiston where there isnt a public bus company and i expect them to live up to their contracts

77687 witnesses or anyone with information are asked to call crimestoppers on 0800 555 111
77688 we havent really discussed it to any great length to the moment i think well probably start to discuss those sorts of things next week
77689 to be fair to those players on our list we need to ensure that the direction we take we let them know as soon as we can
77690 well be doing that before the seasons finished we need to be fair to them so they can get on and prepare for their life after footy or life with us again next year
77691 jeffs a very professional player jeff trains very well hes not in the team at the moment but you never know down the track
77692 i expect us to attack the game i expect us to really take it up to essendon
77693 we have to do that because our last game we started really poorly we have to start well theres no greyness in it so therell be pressure in it
77694 were getting some good game time into our younger players and that adds to a little bit of excitement too
77695 the young guys at times i think have inspired some of our older and more experienced players
77696 i think its a good sign we just need to get a couple of wins

77715 we will complete checks of the cabin emergency oxygen bottles across our boeing 747 fleet tonight
77716 i dont think hes winning the same amount of ball as judd but what youll see with trent once he gets it something happens
77717 ive been involved in the game for over 20 years and hes quite unique in the talent that hes got
77718 richmond are going to have a very very good player for a long long time
77719 trents been outstanding particularly given he missed a fair amount of the pre season and came in late
77720 palmer has been in pretty good form and so has rioli theres no doubt its a three horse race
77721 trents form in the last few games i think will play a major part in who finishes with the award
77722 theyre in terrific form theyre missing a couple of their key players and thats great but they have very very good backup players and its going to be a tough ask for us
77723 but our form over the last five or six weeks has been pretty good and it just gives us an opportunity to probably measure ourselves against the best team in the competition
77724 if were any chance to beat them tomorrow night weve got to play four quarters and thats probably an area we havent done over the past month or so
77725 although were winning games theres still been a lapse at some stage in the game
77726 last week demonstrated to our supporters that there is just another little level that we can go to and its an elite level
77727 that is a level that we demonstrated last week that was an elite level in terms of desire intent intensity call it what you like as good as what there is in the competition
77728 they have obviously got a lot of talent in that side now with the number of draft picks they have been able to have over the years
77729 compared to maybe early in the year their more senior players are now playing really good footy
77730 and as we have seen in a lot of clubs when your senior players are playing well it makes it a lot easier for the younger less experienced players to join in and also play some good footy
77731 we need to be acutely aware at all times of defence shutting players down or trying to keep players under control versus us getting some attack from the midfield
77732 we know the scientists keep telling us we only have until october this year to make an impact on saving the river by getting new water released into the river system immediately
77733 all the federal government has is a plan for a plan a plan that wont take effect until 2019 when its hoping that the state governments will have brought their water sharing plans into line with the sustainable cap
77734 that means we will have a lovely plan but the river will be dead
77735 by 2019 the coorong will be gone and so too may the communities along the lower river areas
77736 the reality is unless we can curb water use and put sustainable measures into place in the extremely near future we are going to be watching the river die
77737 a recent report predicted that the lower lakes would be irreparably damaged if they do not receive water by october
77738 that is less than two months away now and we have to allow time for water to travel from the point of release to the lakes
77739 there is the remotest chance that she would be convicted of murder
77740 she is only 19 years of age the trial is a long way off she has a very strong defence to the charge of murder and she is entitled to the presumption of innocence
77741 when the ship went on that angle they were thrown around people would have been suffering bruises and cuts and there may have been stitches required
77742 forty two people went to visit the medical centre three people were under medical supervision when the ship came into port
77743 the worst injury was a fractured pelvis another passenger suffered a fractured wrist
77744 no one has lost a foot and no one has lost fingers it is not correct
77745 the captain was trying to avoid this weather but he came across it and the ship started rolling the ship rolled about 20 degrees which got things moving
77746 i need to workout because i am out of shape
77747 i dont have to problem solve or think i simply need to do something without thinking that is the type of activity you need to develop the habit you want something were you can just show up
77748 people who are going to china should take a clean computer one with no data at all
77749 what the chinese tried to do was infiltrate their security to see who in china the tibet movement was talking to
77750 a lot of places in the world including china dont have the same view of personal space and privacy that we do in the united states
77751 youve got to suspect that every place youre doing work is being monitored and being watched
77752 i think two issues are going to overshadow what both sides want to do one is the lingering feeling from the beef demonstrations and then this more recent territorial dispute over the dokdo islands
77753 certainly the president doesnt have much time and its somewhat of a legacy issue for him
77754 hes going to focus particularly on verification and moving forward with north korea and getting advice on that
77755 north korea can surprise it can surprise in all kinds of ways but they rarely meet a deadline
77756 without this action which we hope the north will take the delisting will not occur on that time line
77757 i think that it certainly didnt enhance the atmosphere for the visit but on the other hand the president has demonstrated leadership
77758 and we have a very very good relationship with the south korean people
77759 the negative outlook reflects both the potential impact of weaker credit conditions in nabs core geographies as well as ongoing dislocations in credit markets moodys senior vice president patrick winsbury said in a statement

77769 despite all this people kept coming to express their faith and pray to god that lithuania would be free
77770 in the soviet era there were believers who worked for the communist administration and who were ordered to destroy the crosses some refused they were given vodka so their conscience would slip
77771 its said that one who destroyed them had his hand amputated
77772 when i came back from siberia i planted a cross god gave us the gift of a wonderful family its a miraculous place
77773 im proud that we managed to keep putting up crosses in secret during soviet times and im proud that we can now do it openly
77774 we get tourists from around the world for some its just like going to a museum but many come here seeking the grace of god
77775 its like a cemetery for everyone you can come from anywhere and leave a cross even if the grave is elsewhere or you dont know where a loved one is buried
77776 this is astonishing i cant really understand it very well because for me religion is something personal but its made a big impression i really think that for people who lived here under communism it must have helped
77777 we dont have a heavy regulatory burden on the cellular industry
77778 thats something that we have tried to maintain in canada at the end of the day consumers do need to be protected ive made these points publicly and privately with bell ceo mr cope as well

77795 i cant imagine any other industry where people with the same education are divided into two groups with all of the benefits advancement potential and job openings being reserved only for the smaller whiter more male and more affluent group meanwhile the other group is segregated into basements storage spaces and warehouses paid substantially less though often billed to clients at substantially similar rates than the elite group and told that they will never ever be allowed to join the elite group or advance in any way no matter how good of a job they do no matter what level of skills they demonstrate no matter how often they are asked to train new members of the elite and no matter how often they are asked to do more substantive tasks if they dont like the basement they can go start start their own business or find employment outside of that industry because their kind need not apply to any other jobs available within that industry biglaw employment attorneys would be salivating over the potential lawsuits if they found this situation in any other industry

77816 it opens the way to the disarmament demobilisation and reintegration of combatants
77817 we expect other fnl combatants to join the assembly areas in the coming days which will be a confirmation that the peace process is really back on track

77823 it brought together about 100 delegates from seven countries participating countries included burundi ethiopia kenya nigeria and rwanda delegates from uganda and tanzania will also be in attendance the eac secretariat has also confirmed participation
77824 killing is mainly blamed on the armed banditry which claimed 223 victims
77825 the police and the army also account for 31 and 48 cases respectively while fnl is blamed for 47 cases
77826 the author of the report is the only one responsible for its content
77827 whenever a soldier is held responsible for a killing whether by indiscipline or misconduct he is seriously sanctioned before the military jurisdictions

77841 this is an important step forward in the burundi peace process and opens the way for the disarmament demobilisation and reintegration ddr process to begin
77842 it is expected that more palipehutu fnl combatants will move into the assembly areas in the coming days which would confirm that the peace process is firmly on track
77843 the political directorate calls on both the government and the palipehutu fnl to move with haste in completing this phase of the process so that the country can focus beyond the peace process towards the economic recovery and development of burundi

77855 nigeria is prepared to participate fully in any effort to restore peace to the darfur region
77856 any impediments to the deployment of the united nations hybrid force in sudan should be removed so that they can help hasten the peace process
77857 we need to get dialogue going and we offer sudan all the support needed at this difficult time
77858 it is impossible to indict our president and at the same time asking us to take care of foreign forces the request is a contradictory terms
77859 i dont think we would wait for that long before solutions are proffered
77860 we in nigeria appreciate the tremendous effort you have made to bring peace to your country in such a short time as well as on going efforts to build your nation

77882 i hit fasano walked cabrera then made a mistake to sizemore
77883 im not upset about the mistake he obviously was looking for a heater first pitch he got one and he hit it thats what he is supposed to do if its a one run home run its not that big a deal
77884 because of the previous two batters it was much different though but its not necessarily the ninth place hitter that bothers me its walks in general i always feel i have the stuff to get guys out no matter where they hit in the lineup if i make my pitches
77885 to sum this game up the fifth inning was disastrous not the three run home run but the at bat before that the walk to cabrera walking him on a 3 2 breaking ball isnt acceptable
77886 our bullpen has allowed too many walks all year long
77887 you cant win up here doing that walking guys hitting guys thats just the way it is
77888 farnsworth is throwing the best ive seen in a long time
77889 the tigers did a good job addressing a need with that trade
77890 but nothing materialized that made sense for us or for them
77891 if im doing my job i can deal with it
77892 when youre closing its only one inning and you dont say anything if youre banged up a little bit as long as youre doing your job
77893 but if im hurting the team thats not good its just gotten progressively worse this is the first time ive actually felt anything on the mound everything else i felt was after or before
77894 i think he said he thought age was catching up on him a little bit
77895 there are certain things you go through when your body gets older and i thought this ache and pain was just part of it
77896 hes a great player i love him to death i wish him the best
77897 they said i was going in and i said gimme a minute
77898 i thought it was just a perfect straightforward immaculate test i mean the golf course was in great shape obviously but the fairways were a fair width the rough was a fair height the greens were a fair speed
77899 and the golf course is so tough to begin with and long with the new tee boxes its quite a bit longer which really doesnt affect the shots coming in strangely enough
77900 i wouldnt say it played long no i thought it played a good distance it has a good mixture of holes there are some short par 4s you can hit short clubs in and there are some long ones the par 3s are a little monotonous theyre all long theres no cool short one no 13 used to be a cool short one and they moved the tee back so its 190 but theyre just tough 3s you just want to make a 3 on those holes well i hit a 3 iron on no 9 but i wont have a 3 iron ill have a hybrid so i hit a hybrid a couple times
77901 fat city yankees get pudge for farnsworth after blasting os
77902 were putting our resources into other areas at least for this season
77903 he isnt the player he was two years ago when the tigers went to the world series but the tigers arent as good as they were two years ago either before pudge was traded did anybody think that theyd be a better team if only they had brandon inge catching full time and kyle farnsworth in the bullpen i doubt it
77904 just because he can run and hes pain free and doesnt have swelling doesnt mean hes fully rehabbed
77905 its easy to add more movements harder running more change of direction more of everything whether its the next practice or the next day but we cant take it off if we do too much so far hes doing very well
77906 you work so hard for your time to come around its devastating it really challenges you mentally and emotionally
77907 i called him right when we were on the bus on the way to the airport
77908 it was a hard conversation he wasnt expecting it at all he could tell by the sound of my voice he could tell by the level of my voice that something was wrong
77909 we try to expand him every day just to see if all of a sudden that knee blows up
77910 we pushed him real hard today and cut him hard
77911 when you start playing you dont know where youre going
77912 for a fraudulent substitution of urine which is both a prohibited method and also a form of tampering with the doping control process
77913 youve got to make quality pitches thats the bottom line
77914 when you get behind in the count to a very good offense that has different ways to beat you with speed and power its tough
77915 it was a long day im a little tired right now
77916 if you looked at some of the numbers guys were sitting on as we got into the middle of june i think it was very apparent that even their average year would mean a big upswing in the second half of the year

77939 we got them from small clubs in nairobi from dandora and the like but they are very talented we in fact would have like to sign on at least six but we did not have much time
77940 the ministry has expressed its disappointment at reports that the german government gave its approval to a german company to sign on the deal with the iranian gas company
77941 the german governments decision is against the spirit of sanctions that the un security council has placed on iran
77942 it is worrying that precisely germany which is a member of the eu 3 that includes france britain and germany is presenting a position that harms international attempts for significantly strengthening sanction against irans nuclear program
77943 this deal helps iran in this sensitive sector and makes a mockery of the international communitys efforts to isolate a nuclearizing iranian regime
77944 this historic responsibility is part of my countrys fundamental policy it means that for me as a german chancellor israels security is non negotiable

77968 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year
77969 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
77970 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians
77971 aid organisations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
77972 this year there have been over 84 such incidents including 21 in june more than in any other month in the last six years
77973 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
77974 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardising the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
77975 structural separation isnt a necessity but is ideal if you want to be sure there is equal opportunity for all players
77976 scepticism around the validity and value of separation are understandable but at the end of the day it forces the incumbent to have a more considerate view of the wholesale market
77977 regulation emerges from what would otherwise be a free market system because stakeholders with political power are able to entice politicians into imposing regulations that shift wealth from the less powerful to the more powerful
77978 there are other ways to spur competition other than separation
77979 all markets are different and its naive to think you can apply a generic model to every country
77980 structural separation must be viewed from a case by case basis
77981 every incumbents situation has its own idiosyncrasies and comparing other countries attempts at this is mainly a futile discussion
77982 ideally this should have happened prior to the government selling telstra but that wasnt in the best interests of the government at the time
77983 three years later cases where people say im not a racist but whites only still havent been dealt with
77984 it forced much of the country to learn what was happening in the lower ninth ward before katrina
77985 then we saw what happened afterward the demolition displacement and dispersal of whole communities of color by katrina
77986 the government entities charged with protecting citizens engaged in discriminatory practices
77987 it was private nonprofits that had to take the lead in challenging these issues
77988 we all know whether youre voting for sen barack obama whether you are voting for sen john mccain this is going to be one of the most racist election seasons weve ever seen
77989 weve already seen some deceptive practices and tactics that have taken place in years past when there was no candidate of african american descent running
77990 the last thing we need to have happened is people think they are registered and they show up on on election day and their names are not on the rolls
77991 what this will mean is that folks will know that theyve been disenfranchised and four years from now they will not vote
77992 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
77993 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
77994 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
77995 realize that we are dealing with a state asset not an asset of east harris county
77996 i see it as an act of desperation on their part
77997 our energy policy is essentially nonexistent which looks like its been pretty good to houston
77998 but even those in the energy business here in houston will tell you its not sustainable over the long run
77999 is that your idea of a serious policy debate its intellectually bankrupt that agenda so our job is to make sure we resist getting pulled into that nonsense
78000 climate change is real and houston you cannot afford to get any hotter
78001 texas doesnt shy away from big challenges texas likes big
78002 teachers staff members and parents have worked tirelessly so that our students success rate increased each year in an environment of rising academic standards and state mandates
78003 its highly unlikely but one year there was a glitch in the calculation and some ratings changed
78004 we share news with our public as soon as we receive it
78005 hisd will announce friday a record number of houston schools have earned the states highest academic ratings
78006 in too many cases the departments trucks must drive through entire neighborhoods to collect only a few bins
78007 those neighborhoods that do not improve their set out rates will be dropped from the program at the end of this calendar year
78008 recycling does take some partnership between the citizens and the solid waste department
78009 when you have a breakdown in education and no one is focusing on the recycling program participation rates will drop
78010 they would be very smart to come forward very quickly and try to resolve it as quickly as possible
78011 we adamantly deny that petroleum wholesale has intentionally cheated consumers nevertheless because of the misinformation put out by the agricultural commission last week we expected the filing of this lawsuit
78012 we are additionally concerned that some of the testing methods utilized by state inspectors do not comply with the testing protocol set forth by applicable statutes designed to ensure test result accuracy
78013 the 16 million drivers are the best inspectors that we have
78014 that we believe that was knowingly and intentional deceptive fraudulent practices by sunmart
78015 we have provided documents to the department of agriculture have responded to every request for information and will continue to offer our assistance in the process
78016 the key to it is getting the cards in peoples hands and then using them if they do theyre going to save money
78017 if we can find a way to save money thats great but any time i hear the word free i always look for the fine print at the bottom of the page
78018 substance abuse is particularly devastating when it afflicts young people because they are the communitys future
78019 i didnt know what an addict was much less that i was one
78020 i was a functional addict i received good grades in school and maintained two jobs but it got to the point where i was suicidal thats when i approached my parents and they brought me to memorial hermanns center
78021 when you remember that 84 000 drug abusers and 99 000 alcohol abusers arent getting the treatment they need 68 beds for teens wont go a long way
78022 the real problem is that the number of beds funded by the federal and state government dont begin to meet the need
78023 so dawn goes down to day nothing gold can stay
78024 im astonished at the way a company with bassetbabys supposed high standards could take such a disregard in such an important matter families put their faith and trust in their products we put our babys life in a baby crib to have it fall apart is a parents worst nightmare
78025 i expected better from them when i first alerted them to the situation and couldnt believe that i had to make as much noise as i did to get someone to want to do something about this problem i mean we were talking about a babys crib and the possibility of serious or fatal injuries to babies
78026 my father inlaw paid a lot of money for that crib and we thought it was safe
78027 its the hottest one ive been in in a while
78028 this sets us apart from every other rural area in this nation
78029 this shows were willing to invest in things that will make southside and southwest virginia play a role in getting this nation and this world to cut the spigot off of this foreign oil supply it makes us stand out from every other region of this country
78030 this is a broad and diverse range of projects that should be able to leverage private sector funding as well as federal state and local dollars
78031 with this funding 8 million the center can be built the research is ongoing
78032 im excited because the scientists and researchers will be coming here i think thats important
78033 im very excited about this investment in clean coal technology
78034 not only is coal an important valuable resource here in southwest virginia finding ways to help us meet our environmentally sensitive goals is also very important
78035 but 36 million is a pretty big investment im very excited but at the same time they need to prove themselves well see how this first round of funding is utilized
78036 we had an outstanding discussion during our retreat where i believe everyone got to be heard
78037 unless someone really wants to get back into that i would urge we go ahead and vote
78038 or they included something that would have required a state code change
78039 to me the money we give in scholarships is the most important money we spend
78040 i dont know how many students have been able to get an education that couldnt have otherwise done so weve had great results
78041 i would hope that in the future regardless of who is chairman or who is on this commission they would continue to do this

78049 after this we are ordering dna tests for all children whose mothers present credible indications that they were abducted and we are asking parents of those two babies in the u s to voluntarily submit dna tests of their adoptive children
78050 these people are absolutely devastated absolutely horrified over the idea that a child was stolen from a mother
78051 there is grief over the loss of the child but absolute joy that the mother has been found
78052 im coming to china as the president and as a friend
78053 i know its best for the u s china relationship that i go
78054 the chinese government very much appreciates president bushs support for the beijing olympics but they cannot abandon the chinese position on other matters
78055 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
78056 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof

78070 personality features of dependency neediness fear of disapproval submission to authority presence of dissociation for a defense mechanism and chronic depression with drug abuse make a credible explanation for a false confession but they make even a better argument for excessive compliance and submissiveness based on fear of abandonment recapitulating his early life reality that would have been something he could not bear to face

78078 with pakistan you have good cooperation in the counterterrorism area and very legitimate concerns in others
78079 the pakistani government and the isi in particular are not monolithic but the concerns we do have are well founded and they have certainly not abated
78080 is it valid to go after barack obama on inexperience being a bit glib perhaps even a bit arrogant for doing the european tour absolutely but you just sound dopey when you put paris hilton in an ad
78081 to come up with a more affirmative narrative for his candidacy why is he running what does he stand for before going after barack obama
78082 mccain has lost the free media contest over the past couple of weeks hes desperate to make the news and controversial attacks are more newsworthy than boilerplate positive ads
78083 the ad is meant to acknowledge reality that he is huge that he is a celebrity
78084 it wasnt meant to be insulting one of the things we learned from hillary clinton running against obama is that railing against his celebrity whining about his celebrity doesnt work
78085 to inject britney spears and paris hilton into the debate is beneath what america deserves
78086 it was a way for them to get attention for yet another inaccurate misleading negative attack people are caught up with the gimmick
78087 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
78088 every time they put up a negative ad were going to respond with the force of truth
78089 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling
78090 the superchips flashpaq handheld tuner is a sophisticated but easy to use engine management tool designed to deliver extraordinary power and torque gains unparalleled transmission controls and improved fuel economy
78091 we won it seven years in a row then we finished third last year in winnipeg we always sent a team we were called the prince george reds then the lumber kings and then the river kings
78092 ghostkeeper bats leadoff randy bats either no 2 or 9 and i bat in the 3 or 4 spot
78093 i like our chances a lot but it depends on whether top hurler darren zack is ok or not he hurt his back last weekend and if he cant go then it falls to chad or another guy keith garbutt we also might have mike joseph to throw for us but he might not be able to make it
78094 we should do well our first four hitters basically are the first four hitters who played for the river kings all those years with eli jules of chase mixed in there were all playing for horse lake
78095 improved margins in plastics and chemicals enabled us to tide over the challenging environment in the sugar business and rising financial charges
78096 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
78097 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
78098 measures aimed at improving residual values and reducing bad debts will be pursued more intensely
78099 were still trying to understand exactly how the motivational circuits in the brain work
78100 but we know that the brain functions adaptively as muscles do so if you work at becoming more motivated and practice it you prob ably will improve just as youll get stronger if you exercise
78101 weve got millions of interviews that show that when people get motivated their general life sat isfaction increases
78102 you have to understand what it is you really want
78103 one reason some people arent motivated is that the task involved is being dictated by other not their goal
78104 one of the hallmarks of being motivated is feeling like you have some control
78105 if you cant see that you are going to get some emotional payoff pleasure or relief from this
78106 people will say they have a clear commitment to exercising regularly or raising their retirement savings rate or watching less television or quitting smoking but when the moment to do the hard work arrives they find an excuse to put it off again
78107 the emotional system cant see that sacrificing today will generate payoffs tomorrow
78108 it sees only the present sacrifice and it says no i wont clean the attic or quit smoking or forgo the doughnut or go to the gym
78109 for example if you know that when your emotional brain sees candy its going to say eat then put the candy in a drawer where you cant see it
78110 the best memo tins to get you motivated are the ones you are clear and certain about not ones you have t intellectualize
78111 one thing that really helps you stick with your goal is if you can get a mental picture of what your life will be like once you reach it
78112 one woman i worked with who wanted to lose weight said maybe my bra wont cut into my skin so hard visualiza tion makes a goal seem more tangible real and worth it
78113 youll be more motivated to stick with it because youll want to get your moneys worth
78114 when you start saying little mantras it helps you say ok self lets stay stay in solu tions mode rather than going into freak out mode when putting out fires at work for instance i borrow my moth ers mantra there are no problems only solutions
78115 you might let yourself down really easily but you tend not to let other people down
78116 the people who have a written plan step by step for exactly what theyre going to do and where and when are more likely to actually move on their goal
78117 a lot of people get started on working toward a goal and then as soon as the weather changes and the party invitations start coming it can all go out the window
78118 when you recognize that you can take steps to get be yond obstacles rather than doing nothing and feeling helpless
78119 instead of dwelling on the negative dwell on the things that are going right
78120 insurers are increasingly under pressure because of the significant payments being made as a consequence of climate related events as well as the cost of repairs
78121 i thought it would get made before i even thought about making it
78122 i think enough times gone by and people are realising where watchmen sits in the landscape of comic books
78123 now its like were dealing with sacred pages where before it was fine to put arnold schwarzenegger in the movie
78124 but all those things have come together and made me able to go these pages are sacred we need to do it like this
78125 its simply the greatest comic ever written its that simple
78126 theres a thing with watchmen that scares the s t out of you at the same time as it excites you but weve all taken a blood oath that were not going to f k it up
78127 im still going to decide at the end of the season whether im going to stay
78128 all ive been thinking about was npc and now ive been called into the all blacks my main focus has been the test against australia tomorrow
78129 he knew what he had to do he didnt need to be rung up and told why he wasnt selected because he knew what he had to do and took it upon himself to make the changes
78130 he was very positive and showed us a bit of hunger
78131 it feels good to be back in the squad and trying to get back in the team after last years exit
78132 im definitely feeling hungry to get back in the squad and to get my opportunity if it does come on saturday ill take the opportunity to prove my point and hopefully do well
78133 i am pretty hungry and i have been pretty positive
78134 theres always room to work on your fitness and im still doing that but i feel im capable of doing my job around the field im feeling quite fit
78135 i guess in a way it has i got a lot better at the end of super 14 and when i wasnt selected the only thing i could do was turn things into a positive

78139 with all the evidence that is now before them i dont see any reason why the authorities should continue with these investigations of alleged sodomy
78140 in any other system where there is justice and fairness the powers would have by now shut down the investigations and cleared my name
78141 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
78142 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
78143 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989
78144 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out

78149 it means that some 98 000 pages of evidence which the state confiscated in raids on mr zumas homes and also those of his legal adviser at the time two of his legal advisers can be used as evidence against him in the corruption trial which is scheduled to get underway next week
78150 it flows out of the conviction in 2005 of his former financial adviser schabir sheik and it revolves around money that was said to have been solicited by zuma in order that he would intervene on behalf of a company bidding for parts of south africas arms deal
78151 on these particular matters yes but he will next week seek to have the entire case thrown out of court when his trial is due to begin in kwazulu natal province in pietermartizburg there are also other applications pending one in mauritius another in the united kingdom where he is seeking to have the release of documents to the national prosecuting authority blocked
78152 its important to make a government that tackles reforms with the goal of improving and encouraging peoples lives but remains gentle for the less privileged in society
78153 what people really want is a fundamental political change a change in policies something more substantial
78154 any device capable of storing information in digital or analog form
78155 written materials commonly referred to as pocket trash or pocket litter
78156 theyre saying they can rifle through all the information in a travelers laptop without having a smidgen of evidence that the traveler is breaking the law
78157 dont establish any criteria for whose computer can be searched
78158 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
78159 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
78160 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
78161 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
78162 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
78163 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
78164 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
78165 its everybodys desire for the trials to be as open as possible
78166 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
78167 we hope that iran will choose cooperation instead of increasing isolation and will give us in the following days a response that the international community is waiting for
78168 at this time the evidence not support such a charge
78169 were now looking at an oct 15th date for opening the hotel and restaurant
78170 it is a fact that this country has made significant gains over the past four years and as a government and a people we cannot allow lawlessness and crime to erode the tangible benefits and the quality of life that our country now enjoys
78171 the truth is unpalatable to some people but the recent killing of dr mullany and the brutal attack on her husband are threats to our very survival as they directly threaten our main industry tourism
78172 in cracking the number of unsolved murders still on the books
78173 these criminal deportees with skills developed and nurtured in the us and uk are impacting tremendously on our society
78174 if the antigua police service ask for our help in these tragic circumstances south wales police will do whatever we can to support
78175 we have appointed two specially trained family liaison officers who are continuing to support both families at this difficult time
78176 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing
78177 it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do
78178 when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned further betrayal
78179 even the pope is elected by his peers but what anglicans have is a man appointed by a secular government
78180 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well
78181 ten billion dollars today will as from august 1 be revalued to one zimdollar dollar
78182 general petraeus and ambassador to iraq ryan crocker caution that the progress is still reversible but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
78183 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
78184 and in the months ahead the iraqis will continue taking the lead in more military operations across the country
78185 an art gallery where doctors just happen to treat cancer
78186 the difference between eastern and western europe for gay people is sometimes a really depressing experience
78187 young polish people travel a lot and they go to places like spain where gays can get married and they are no different under the law than other people
78188 and they come back home and ask why cant it be like that here
78189 poles are still believers unlike in many other countries which makes conservative forces here stronger
78190 there is no sexual education in schools because of the church so young people know little about homosexuality besides what they hear on sunday or on the street

78205 well if youve got a slowing economy coming off the back of the highest inflation rate in 16 years and 12 interest rate rises in a row then the flow through to growth in the economy and the flow through to employment one just follows the other
78206 i believe that we have a strong policy course of action to see this economy through we are in the best position in a better position than most other economies in the western world given our strong budgetary position the independence of our reserve bank and as well as a clear strategy of economic reform
78207 it will be tough we are not immune from the global economy but i believe weve got strong policy settings for the future

78219 such a change in department leadership was necessary following the mishandling of the 311 information hotline and crime camera programs
78220 completed an assessment and review of the crime cameras installed by the citys information technology department
78221 i made it clear in my state of the city address that 200 crime cameras would be operational by the end of july no excuses the crime cameras are a useful tool for our police officers and we want to ensure that they have all the tools and resources that they need to protect our citizens
78222 optimus prime comes to america as an immigrant this is true but what is also true is that he and his fellow autobots have lived here for the last four million years investing their time and energy in the land that they have come to love and call home
78223 like myself optimus prime is a veteran of many wars his tactical acumen combined with advanced cybertronian weaponry is what america needs in its global war on terror ive got a date in hell with osama bin laden and the big guy here is going to help me keep it
78224 the only reason we have a decepticon problem is because the autobots led them to earth
78225 i optimus prime and my fellow autobots left our home world of cybertron in search of energon cubes we must as two races brought together through adversity and a desire for freedom from tyranny free ourselves from dependence on foreign energy sources senator mccain and i optimus prime have a nine point plan that would utilize the energy wealth in anwr this plan would bring relief for working class families at the pumps and lead us to victory against the decepticons
78226 sure anybody looks young and vital when youre standing next to a million year old robot and theres the issue of the autobot matrix of leadership optimus prime has the combined knowledge of every autobot leader at his disposal weve already had eight years of dick cheney another suspected robot in disguise calling the shots in the white house must we continue to reduce the office of the president to that of a figurehead

78274 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
78275 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
78276 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue

78359 i continue to stay healthy and im surrounded by good talent and good things are going to come from that so as long as i can stay healthy and these guys do their job around me were going to do some special things here in montreal
78360 it was a huge play obviously to be able to start fast but to my recollection the last three games i think weve started fast in the third quarter
78361 i just wanted them to forget about the first half and move on like it didnt happen the game was 0 0 and just go play and they handled it very well and they finished the game
78362 richie did what he can do we had too many penalties i dont know what the total was but weve been doing good the last time we lost the penalty ratio was the first game against montreal and the rest of the games weve been plus
78363 any game you can come in and go 5 for 5 its definitely a good feeling especially two of them being 50 and 51
78364 its always a tough decision when you leave an organization like detroit

78457 washington the white house predicted yesterday that president bush would leave a record 482 billion deficit to his successor a sobering turnabout in the nations fiscal condition from 2001 when bush took office after three consecutive years of budget surpluses
78458 and the worst may be yet to come the deficit does not reflect the full cost of military operations in iraq and afghanistan the potential cost of another economic stimulus package or the possibility of steeper losses in tax revenues if individual income or corporate profits decline it also does not account for any drains on the national treasury that might result from further declines in the housing market
78459 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
78460 barack obama calls on warren buffett among others as he turns his attention to the troubled u s economy

78462 democrat barack obama is telling economic advisers he would move
78463 the presidential candidate met with about a dozen advisers on monday to talk about his approach to dealing with a sour economy among them were afl cio president john sweeney and former federal reserve chairman paul volcker
78464 as part of a week long shift back to economic issues barack obama will meet with federal reserve chairman ben bernanke on tuesday his campaign confirmed
78465 republicans make it so simple giving gazillionaires more gazillions will create a growing economic tide lifting all boats trickle down to grateful wage earners and generate gads of tax revenue to shrink the massive deficit conservatives created by giving gazillionaires more loot

78467 the bush administration on monday plans to project the u s budget deficit will soar to a new record of nearly half a trillion dollars in fiscal 2009 as the economic outlook darkens and americans elect a new president
78468 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans for example have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging they have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something that america has learned the right lessons from the japanese internments during wwii and that i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
78469 again which one of your cross burning budies keeps telling you obama is a muslim i just want to know

78709 we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
78710 were trying to fight to revitalize a small town in pennsylvania and were fighting a congressman who treats federal earmarks as if they are his own money
78711 im not trying to pick a fight i am trying to fund a project that can change the face of nanticoke and improve its future
78712 because we are trying to keep the money in nanticoke doesnt mean anyone is trying to take his seat in congress we will fight every inch of the way to assure that the money gets spent to revitalize downtown nanticoke
78713 this just shows again how bush republicans are bankrolling barlettas feeble fundraising effort
78714 by taking and keeping the stevens money barletta basically buys into the gop culture of corruption that forced them out of the leadership in congress in 2006 and still persists today special interests like halliburton and oil companies dominate the bush administration lobbyists run the mccain campaign and indicted public officials contribute to barletta
78715 this campaign has not received a contribution from the pac in question
78716 six years ago this pac made a contribution to the 2002 campaign this was long before any allegations were made against the senator
78717 if mr kanjorski would like we could send a release a day on all the questionable contributions he has received during his 24 years in congress
78718 this is a country of laws and any elected official accused of corruption and unethical behavior has the right to due process
78719 show some courage and schedule some debates rather than hide behind his smear team
78720 should never in any way be confused with a real contract
78721 it is nothing more than the standard document presented to all at will employees
78722 they can go past the oct 31 appeal deadline with a judges blessing thats happened in many larger reassessments
78723 im not suggesting wed have as many people go through the appeals process but a lot certainly would
78724 another years worth of changes in the real estate market means new values on everything
78725 there are some areas that would go down in value and some that would go up even more
78726 its not a continuance because legally youd have to repeat much of what has already been done
78727 there are no current plans to conduct another countywide reassessment
78728 those concerns were affirmed to be legitimate after an admission of error by 21st century
78729 it would be costly for the county to postpone the logical thing for them to do is to see it through and correct any outstanding issues between now and march
78730 i worked three years on the case and tried it with four lawyers against me and had two trials back to back
78731 i worked very hard on this case just like i do on all my cases
78732 we now have a grid that is interstate and is international i think state siting of large regional machines that extend across national borders is inconsistent with the reality of the grid
78733 theyre saying that were asking them to solve a 40 year problem in 40 days
78734 a lot of these appraisers locally cant take on another client theyre overloaded
78735 basically theyre saying that they understand reassessment must be done but they dont understand how 21st century came up with some of its numbers
78736 21st century has 8 million reasons to be there and take it
78737 no matter what time reassessment happens its not popular it will come under great scrutiny and criticism he has to develop thick skin
78738 nobody has come forward with names so i wonder if the district attorney should conduct an investigation into data collectors
78739 even if 21st century has the greatest formulas known to mankind it will be wrong if the data is wrong
78740 they could set up an algebra equation to calculate investment returns
78741 we want to expose students to the possibilities of a career in financing
78742 the people working on the low end of the salary scale on the ubs trading floor earn 60 000 to 70 000
78743 the sentence is fair and appropriate it meets the needs of the community the victims involved in this case and mr solomon
78744 im really sorry about what happened i want to get on with my life
78745 i want to get out when im relatively young so i still have a chance to be a productive member of the community
78746 were looking for some sort of light at the end of the tunnel for mr solomon
78747 hes trying to turn his life around he has a substantial prison sentence and hes making a conscious effort
78748 it sounds like they are an agency subject to the sunshine act and the act says they cant forbid cameras video recorders or audio recorders at public meetings
78749 we miss how you loved to spit up on uncle charlies pillow he made for grandma
78750 emily touched many lives in the short times she was with us
78751 she brought us a smile to everyones face she was loved and cherished by all
78752 one of the sweetest babies anyone could have been blessed with
78753 we are just trying to remember this is just for emily
78754 i miss her a lot i miss everything about her
78755 after the amazing success of our sports shows in november and march we decided to produce a summer show to bridge the gap for all of the sports fans
78756 the show will feature many all time greats across the major sports as well as some of todays stars our autograph lineup will truly set the standard for summer sports shows
78757 i am thrilled to once again be participating in a major summer sports show
78758 especially in chicago which is consistently one of my strongest buying markets
78759 just to know that thats the last test im ever going to take and im never going to study ever again its pretty awesome
78760 wants to pursue policies that focus on peoples daily lives
78761 without a reshuffle the administration would only keep losing strength this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
78762 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post
78763 he is shouting like mad only hark he is waving his hands he is wagging his head he has certainly found a snark
78764 ill have to circumnavigate the project to reach my suppliers or to get to job sites which will probably add two to three hours a job a week
78765 sitting in traffic or taking the long way around adds to fuel costs which are already very high its just one more thing to be worried about it makes it very tough for small businesses like mine
78766 well be closing two of the four lanes around the clock
78767 there may also be times during off peak hours such as at night or on weekends when well have to take eight mile down to just one lane to accelerate resurfacing efforts the second section of the project will be to resurface eight mile from i 75 to i 94
78768 what makes this 4 year old assault case so important all of a sudden its not a stretch to figure out that my guy knew tamara greene
78769 but i dont think mr king is as much of a suspect as a possible witness who they police might want to put some pressure on to get him to talk to them
78770 she told me she got beat up at a party
78771 as is the case with gary brown ira todd was prevented from doing his job
78772 we dont even know if the drug dealers allegations about a relationship with the mayor are true the point is todd was not allowed to investigate the matter and its the interference with these investigations of the mayor which leads some people to believe there may be truth in the allegations
78773 todd talked to a police sergeant in lexington who told him nemo had a brother named james davis who lived in the area
78774 the sergeant told todd that james davis was the target of an investigation into drug dealing and mortgage fraud
78775 a few days after making the report todd said he was told by his supervisors to take his vacation immediately
78776 youd think after investigating this hit man and finding out that he was involved in 10 murders that todd would be a hero in the police department
78777 but only if the top supervisors in the department were satisfied he would do nothing to further assist the lexington police department in its investigation of james davis or follow up on the reported connection between mayor kilpatrick and james davis
78778 todds supervisors realized mayor kilpatrick would be extremely angered if todds report about information linking the mayor to james davis were investigated by todd or if the information were to become public
78779 why they were pushing for an excavation that didnt need to be done was my problem
78780 i didnt want them to dig up my whole yard because there are other ways to approach the problem
78781 compromise is the only way we can get it accomplished
78782 we need to get it corrected so more waste can be moved down the line at a faster rate
78783 if we can come to an agreement we can still have it done by next fall
78784 poetry should leave you feeling freer and not more burdened i like to think of all good poetry as providing more oxygen in the atmosphere poems just make it easier to breathe
78785 these poems invite us into the world of west coast winter here the subdued realms of death and memory run hidden currents under the immediacy of bright moss and quick birds this is a book for any season
78786 unlearning a process of finding the truth in your fiction
78787 this class was so deeply nourishing and relaxing i actually slept the whole night through not even a bathroom wake up call
78788 by writing our stories we begin to understand what was formerly clear
78789 i am collecting old cell phones working or not to recycle for a bit of cash
78790 i also have a 30 minute dvd version of my one woman performance of rachel carson returns available for sale at 25 includes s h or at a discount with your cell phone or if you need one
78791 have you ever known a farmer that was an atheist
78792 it is now illegal even to kneel and pray in front of a clinic that performs abortions
78793 there is no vow that the militant atheist will not violate if he perceives any risk to his material well being
78794 all this results in that mental attitude and that quest for money and the power to protect it which allow the jew to become so unscrupulous in his choice of means so merciless in their use of his own ends
78795 she was trying to move on in her life and he didnt like it
78796 the extent of the efforts to conceal her identity its quite ghastly
78797 told numerous stories about what happened and the last place he saw her
78798 when i think of the horror and my daughter is truly gone forever a psychological shield goes up and i deny shes gone
78799 i did not lobby on behalf of systematic or anything
78800 i was afraid that especially with the price of gas instead of taking it to a site people would just dump it in the city of detroit
78801 i dont like it because of the pain it causes the community and i dont like it because of the pain it causes the police department
78802 i want constituents to understand they are not going to hear a whole lot of talking from me
78803 sometimes we talk too much as elected officials and we dont get enough done when other people are talking im busy working
78804 we need a person that has seniority in the legislature and a person that already has the respect of our colleagues
78805 trust in elected officials is at an all time low an all time low weve got to do better
78806 all you have to do is drive up grand river and it doesnt need an expert to tell you something is wrong and it requires
78807 presents a change from the past we know we can do better this isnt something that started yesterday
78808 i can appreciate nothing in life is free you have to work hard for it
78809 is somebody who is often underestimated she got the no 2 spot in the house democratic caucus which is very difficult to do she does things a little differently in terms of her style and its had some effect
78810 its about what i do every day and what ive done for 30 years
78811 its not about slamming anyone its about helping people make a difference in their lives im going to win the race
78812 as we continue to build our team were fortunate that we were able to sign a player as talented as kareem rush
78813 we feel his abilities on both ends of the floor and his range as a 3 point shooter will be assets to us this season
78814 tulsa has been a very important part of our efforts to be successful in oklahoma city with the nba relocation
78815 ultimately the team must be a statewide team and weve committed to that we believe in that and we know that will work
78816 i think its not lost on clay and sam that the other two teams that own their own d league teams happened to be in the western conference finals last year
78817 so if thats a motivator of purchase so be it
78818 when youre building your team you want to have an identity a culture that youre developing
78819 having a team here is going to give us another opportunity to help foster that and the proximity gives us great ability to stay in touch with our players coaches and staff as we continue to develop the identity for the basketball team
78820 committed to playing as many preseason games here as make sense
78821 we are committed to a tangible presence in the market with our team
78822 this is truly the highest caliber of basketball outside the nba
78823 we havent really discussed it to any great length to the moment i think well probably start to discuss those sorts of things next week
78824 to be fair to those players on our list we need to ensure that the direction we take we let them know as soon as we can
78825 well be doing that before the seasons finished we need to be fair to them so they can get on and prepare for their life after footy or life with us again next year
78826 jeffs a very professional player jeff trains very well hes not in the team at the moment but you never know down the track
78827 i expect us to attack the game i expect us to really take it up to essendon
78828 we have to do that because our last game we started really poorly we have to start well theres no greyness in it so therell be pressure in it
78829 were getting some good game time into our younger players and that adds to a little bit of excitement too
78830 the young guys at times i think have inspired some of our older and more experienced players
78831 it has been in process for a few days we do the checks as the aircraft arrive back in australia
78832 we will complete checks of the cabin emergency oxygen bottles across our boeing 747 fleet tonight
78833 i dont think hes winning the same amount of ball as judd but what youll see with trent once he gets it something happens
78834 ive been involved in the game for over 20 years and hes quite unique in the talent that hes got
78835 richmond are going to have a very very good player for a long long time
78836 trents been outstanding particularly given he missed a fair amount of the pre season and came in late
78837 palmer has been in pretty good form and so has rioli theres no doubt its a three horse race
78838 trents form in the last few games i think will play a major part in who finishes with the award
78839 theyre in terrific form theyre missing a couple of their key players and thats great but they have very very good backup players and its going to be a tough ask for us
78840 but our form over the last five or six weeks has been pretty good and it just gives us an opportunity to probably measure ourselves against the best team in the competition
78841 if were any chance to beat them tomorrow night weve got to play four quarters and thats probably an area we havent done over the past month or so
78842 we know the scientists keep telling us we only have until october this year to make an impact on saving the river by getting new water released into the river system immediately
78843 all the federal government has is a plan for a plan a plan that wont take effect until 2019 when its hoping that the state governments will have brought their water sharing plans into line with the sustainable cap
78844 that means we will have a lovely plan but the river will be dead
78845 by 2019 the coorong will be gone and so too may the communities along the lower river areas
78846 the reality is unless we can curb water use and put sustainable measures into place in the extremely near future we are going to be watching the river die
78847 a recent report predicted that the lower lakes would be irreparably damaged if they do not receive water by october
78848 that is less than two months away now and we have to allow time for water to travel from the point of release to the lakes
78849 when the ship went on that angle they were thrown around people would have been suffering bruises and cuts and there may have been stitches required
78850 forty two people went to visit the medical centre three people were under medical supervision when the ship came into port
78851 the worst injury was a fractured pelvis another passenger suffered a fractured wrist
78852 no one has lost a foot and no one has lost fingers it is not correct
78853 the captain was trying to avoid this weather but he came across it and the ship started rolling the ship rolled about 20 degrees which got things moving
78854 last week demonstrated to our supporters that there is just another little level that we can go to and its an elite level
78855 that is a level that we demonstrated last week that was an elite level in terms of desire intent intensity call it what you like as good as what there is in the competition
78856 they have obviously got a lot of talent in that side now with the number of draft picks they have been able to have over the years
78857 compared to maybe early in the year their more senior players are now playing really good footy
78858 and as we have seen in a lot of clubs when your senior players are playing well it makes it a lot easier for the younger less experienced players to join in and also play some good footy
78859 this class was so deeply nourishing and relaxing i actually slept the whole night through not even a bathroom wake up call

78868 some of the most fascinating themes woven through the collection are questions of difference obedience forgiveness and the challenge of accepting joy in imperfect conditions her grandmothers blindness mothers crippling arthritis the rigors of a nuns life and a brief need to be left alone to be crazy all held the protagonist in finally she breaks loose expresses her rage and makes a rich productive life for herself
78869 this class was so deeply nourishing and relaxing i actually slept the whole night through not even a bathroom wake up call

78880 it has been a tough grueling process the worst of which was a court that would not allow us to discuss the negotiations with the residents of our community or members of the media
78881 and movies shown at festivals will no longer be exempt
78882 privacy is respected and guaranteed in china chinas security measures in hotels and other public places are not beyond the internationally generally used measures
78883 the chinese government has put in place a system to spy on and gather information about every guest at hotels where olympic visitors are staying
78884 this means journalists athletes families and other visitors will be subjected to invasive intelligence gathering by the chinese public security bureau

78887 he just told us thank you for our service said health minister yoichi masuzoe afterwards
78888 we accept the verdict and respect the jurys decision and now well move on to the sentencing part of the case
78889 he wont hurt no one else in the world like he did those two women
78890 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath
78891 their purpose in iraq is increasingly changing from fighting a war to keeping a peace
78892 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
78893 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
78894 we received far fewer bodies because of the improved security situation the current rate is close to any normal country
78895 i am optimistic that the worst has passed and we will not see many bodies in the city anymore the iraqi people are no longer interested in continuing the cycle of violence
78896 the number of bodies has declined but i think this is a temporary calm because there are sleeper cells ready to resume their killings anytime
78897 also there are militiamen who have fled the country and might return as soon as possible
78898 la paz no se consigue sin esfuerzo si quieres la paz trabaja por la paz
78899 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
78900 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
78901 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
78902 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
78903 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
78904 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
78905 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
78906 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
78907 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present

78911 without a reshuffle the administration would only keep losing strength this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
78912 even some ldp members have been saying that its better to hold snap elections as early as possible because they dont think they can win elections with fukuda in the prime ministers post

78918 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
78919 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
78920 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
78921 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
78922 i think this is interesting research as it shows a reasonably consistent effect the reduction in blood pressure is not trivial it is the same as gained from taking pills
78923 what we do not know is if garlic works as well as pills over the long term or if it would reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke but i was surprised at the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with garlic
78924 there is no harm in taking garlic along with other lifestyle factors such as eating less red meat less salt less alcohol and taking more exercise and also continuing to take blood pressure medication
78925 anyone could benefit from regular doses of garlic but it is important not to assume that taking supplements is all you need to treat high blood pressure
78926 a one line offer to buy or lease the site but neither look like genuinely viable

78936 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
78937 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
78938 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
78939 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
78940 pensavi di fare rumore e invece alcuni nemmeno ti pubblicano piu max la tua inchiesta sui periodici italiani allestero non piace a molti
78941 max devi renderti conto che gli sprechi colossali che riferisci accadevano con il silenzio assenzo degli italiani in italia che non vogliono stare a sentire a noi italiani di fuori e che pensano di liquidarci con qualche centesimo il problema e che anche quello va ai soliti noti e a noi non arriva niente gli italiani all estero che ricevono
78942 sono ammanicati con gli italiani ditalia risultato loro prendono tutto
78943 ma perche pensi che si parla ora di questi periodici
78944 leggi qua e mi mostra larticolo di una agenzia di stampa
78945 stanno aumentando i soldi dopo secoli che davano una miseria ai periodi italiani allestero
78946 e ora i soliti noti stanno salivando per prendersi tutto come prima solo che di piu senza controlli sara una bella pappatoia
78947 per questo molti non ti vogliono pubblicare max smettila che e inutile
78948 tu pensa che max ha mandato larticolo a tutti quelli del mae tutti sanno tutto ma nessuno dice niente

78951 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
78952 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
78953 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
78954 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
78955 this is one of the publishing sensations of the decade brad and angelina are the dream couple of the glossy magazine world and we expect to triple our circulation because of the public s fascination and interest in the couple and their children
78956 i call on the iraqi government not to sign the security agreement with the united states and i confirm that i am ready to support the government publicly and politically if it doesnt sign
78957 to unify so that they can stand up against the security agreement in political and peaceful ways
78958 i am not ready to say anything because it is too premature you see after all in this country we have had prime ministers who people never expected will be prime minister
78959 we have not talked about the third alternative be very clear about it our parties understanding of the third alternative is not some combination to fight elections
78960 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
78961 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
78962 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
78963 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
78964 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
78965 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
78966 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
78967 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
78968 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
78969 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
78970 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
78971 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
78972 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
78973 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
78974 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
78975 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
78976 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
78977 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
78978 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
78979 accordingly there is a need to provide identity cards to all fishermen and this will be taken up in a phased manner
78980 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
78981 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
78982 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
78983 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
78984 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
78985 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
78986 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
78987 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
78988 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
78989 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
78990 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
78991 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
78992 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
78993 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
78994 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
78995 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
78996 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
78997 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
78998 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
78999 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
79000 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
79001 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
79002 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
79003 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
79004 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
79005 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
79006 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
79007 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
79008 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
79009 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
79010 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
79011 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
79012 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
79013 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
79014 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
79015 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
79016 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
79017 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
79018 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
79019 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
79020 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
79021 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
79022 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
79023 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
79024 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
79025 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
79026 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
79027 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
79028 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
79029 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
79030 who are open to doing something on the production side
79031 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
79032 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
79033 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
79034 ive seen what may be the best futuristic anthology series since the glory days of the twilight zone and the outer limits its called masters of science fiction

79036 sitting around complaining about how hard it is that people send you books for free and there are too many of them to read and life is just too much for you is just pure whininess
79037 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
79038 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
79039 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
79040 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
79041 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
79042 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
79043 for the past several days ive been working very closely with the fsm consul general the fsm health ministry along with the key stakeholders the hospital the naval hospital continental airlines immigration and border control and of course our public health doctors
79044 tb can happen to anybody no one is immune to it and basically what we need for the community to know is that anyone out there has coughed for more than three weeks and loss of fever appetite or feel sick they really need to see their doctor right away and get themselves checked
79045 the thing we want to emphasize that these people were not treated adequately so if you have the symptoms of tb its very important that you seek medical care either your medical doctor or public health if the disease if the disease is identified and treated then patient will recover but if you stay home and ignore it the chances are you may not recover from the disease

79157 yes following the success of chandramukhi i was scripting its sequel even rajnikant had heard the outline of the story and given the green signal when things were beginning to fall in place natarajan an associate director in malayalam cinema suggested i watch the film katha parayumpol a runaway hit in kerala the film revolved around a barbers fascination for film star mammootty the minute i saw it i imagined our own superstar in a film like that the climax made a deep impact on me ive never come across such a story
79158 the superstar watched the film but left without a comment i was puzzled but the call came the following day he told me how much the film had impacted him and evinced interest in it we met and discussed the nitty gritty but having said yes to robot he wondered how he would be able to juggle two films at a time i assured him i would wrap up his portion real fast he agreed mainly because the film had affected him so deeply
79159 it was rajni who suggested that k balachander his mentor watch the film so that his production house kavithalaya could take it up balachander felt the story had a striking semblance to that of the superstar and insisted rajni play himself in the film thats how things began to roll with pushpa kandasmy as producer its set for release on july 31
79160 in tamil we zeroed in on pasupathi rajni was impressed by his performance in veyil we wanted someone who has not seen the superstar in person or acted with him vadivelu plays a meaty role and so does meena she appears in the tamil and telugu versions rajnis heroine in the film is none other than nayanthara
79161 its a role that will be remembered and its not merely a guest appearance we have seen bits and pieces of rajni as rajni in valli and anbulla rajnikant i personally feel the scene count doesnt matter what matters is the impact a character makes and the message he she conveys and thats where kuselan scores what sets it apart from such star centric films is the treatment
79162 the number will be a sure fire hit it features the icon in 10 stylish looks portions of the song were shot with real fans at the shanti theatre if you remember a r rahmans first film was roja a kavithalaya production now kuselan has music by the maestros nephew g v prakash
79163 each is great in his own way they have distinct styles and a major following but much depends on the treatment of the script
79164 eight years after i did uzhaipali with rajni chandramukhi happened soon kuselan followed i wish to do more films with him but as you know man proposes god disposes so lets wait and see

79341 and on of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise
79342 father forgive them for they know not what they do
79343 and on of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us
79344 everybody wants to go to heaven lord nobody wants to die
79345 then samuel said to saul the lord sent me to anoint you as king over his people over israel now therefore listen to the words of the lord
79346 utterly destroy all that he has and do not spare him but put to death both man and woman child and infant ox and sheep camel and donkey
79347 then saul summoned the people and numbered them in telaim 200 000 foot soldiers and 10 000 men of judah 5saul came to the city of amalek and set an ambush in the valley 6saul said to the kenites go depart go down from among the amalekites so that i do not destroy you with them for you showed kindness to all the sons of israel when they came up from egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites 7so saul defeated the amalekites from havilah as you go to shur which is east of egypt 8he captured agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword 9but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep the oxen the fatlings the lambs and all that was good and were not willing to destroy them utterly but everything despised and worthless that they utterly destroyed
79348 then from the midst of the fire that streamed from heaven there sounded forth to their utter amazement a voice for the flame became articulate speech in the language familiar to the audience
79349 the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified
79350 if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee
79351 whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you
79352 of those women we were able to follow 418 women who gave birth vaginally had a second child or more were tested for gbs during their first and second pregnancies and were not excluded from the study due to various factors we found that of the 418 the risk of testing positive for gbs during a second pregnancy was 53 percent
79353 our study did not tackle this issue but the results could help experts decide whether it is cost effective to keep testing women in subsequent pregnancies if their risk of testing positive remains so high
79354 the test involves a swab of the vaginal rectal area if a woman tests positive and is therefore considered colonized she will most likely be treated with intravenous iv antibiotic therapy during labor the antibiotics will help protect the infant
79355 but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world
79356 rabbi we must have a conference to settle this dispute once and for all
79357 rabbi you are outvoted eleven to one we have the majority
79358 so you think you are right and i am wrong because of a vote well think again for i will call on the holy one of israel to give us a sign that i am right and you are wrong
79359 alright alright so it is eleven to two but we still have the majority
79360 weve found that cb1 expression is lost in most colorectal cancers and when that happens a cancer promoting protein is free to inhibit cell death
79361 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
79362 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
79363 people have looked at cannabinoids in cancer earlier mainly in cell culture experiments
79364 the molecular mechanisms for loss of the receptor and its effect on cancer have not been previously shown
79365 just increasing the levels of cannabinoids to treat colorectal cancer wont work if the cb1 receptor is not present
79366 o m g he is so gorgeous someone should have warned me
79367 hey look at this her uterus faces backwards its a tipped one

79375 perhaps this will make class a bit more bearable with fond regards your secret admirer
79376 las expectativas han sido superadas yo pensaba que me iban a ense ar qu es un mouse y cosas as pero es un nivel much simo m s alto de hecho vi cosas muy tiles yo estudio ingenier a en sistemas y aprend cosas que no hab a visto en la universidad

79378 no really you might be surprised if i ever see you i will give you something shiney d
79379 you never know she might just be the person you have been waiting to meet
79380 um dever nosso estar aqui meu rep dio a esta atitude antidemocr tica de um candidato que j esteve tanto tempo no poder a sensa o de que j ganhou
79381 falta de disposi o para discutir id ias importantes para a cidade
79382 i am sorry for your loss i know you were close to your grandfather
79383 no no im ok we all new he would go soon but its still just hard
79384 remember when we used to walk around here that was one of the better times of my life do you ever wonder
79385 si me preguntan qu es mi poes a debo decirles no s pero si le preguntan a mi poes a ella les dir qui n soy yo
79386 my transition has changed who i am and who my friends are
79387 ik trek het niet meer en heb me altijd voorgenomen dat indien ik geen honderd procent meer kan geven tijdens een optreden ik er mee zou stoppen
79388 waarom ruik ik steeds jouw geur nog of je bij me bent
79389 het kind niet goed zou kunnen opgroeien wegens het ontbreken van een vader figuur
79390 but the core group of players that we have here we expect to have here for a long time we expect lance berkman to be here we expect carlos lee and roy oswalt and miguel tejada to be here certainly hunter pence we could have traded hunter to 100 different teams over the last couple of weeks if we wanted to do something like that we believe in the core nucleus that we have here if we can add players that give us more long term options wed love to be able to do that the one deal that we talked about thursday would have given us that opportunity
79391 we are paying attention to the future paying attention to the future from the standpoint that we have a chance to get possibly the top 21 guys that we selected in the draft done this year so were operating on both sides of the street at this point in trying to be good now and for the long term
79392 the important thing is to keep playing hard and stay positive i was in this situation before in oakland its not just one chance to make the playoffs there are two chances
79393 we have the team to do it the pitchings really shown a lot of potential lately with roy healthy we have a good pitching staff
79394 carlos lee and berkman will do their thing if me and miggy and kaz matsui get hot we could make it happen
79395 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
79396 the commissioner preferred to let those discussions continue rather than act on the reinstatement petition today
79397 if he was given his release theres no guarantee hed go anywhere to play
79398 however hed have the freedom to choose if he should decide to play
79399 i think it says a lot about the unselfishness that we have on this team
79400 they all know that another guy means potentially less time for them to play but no ones worried about losing that extra inning or that extra at bat if it means him getting on the field
79401 im glad that they kept me on the team even though i havent been able to play
79402 theyve been real good at supporting me and keeping me up and ive done a pretty good job of keeping them ready to play and keeping them going during the games
79403 it would surprise me if they thought he would come back for the veterans minimum
79404 ive known rockets owner leslie alexander for a long time dikembe has a very good relationship with les well get together when we get back and see if there can be a situation for dikembe to consider playing another season
79405 i dont know if what were doing has been decided were planning to sit down with dikembe it looks like after the olympics we hope to convince him to return
79406 youve just got to do your best and know your time in the league is not very long and take advantage of every opportunity
79407 mike looked a lot faster than everyone else to begin with but then he got tired
79408 so weve got to get him going it was an easy call for us because he knows what were doing he could walk out here today and work
79409 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
79410 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win
79411 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
79412 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
79413 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
79414 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
79415 but it kind of told us that we werent finished yet and chasing the gold is something to do with it
79416 i think with the combination of getting so close to a gold our success in miami that january of 05 and then funding offered to us by the united states olympic committee we just decided to do it again
79417 because like in any sport every four years the athletes get fitter they get better and we get older being 40 i wouldnt say im any weaker or less fit than i was four or eight years ago its just the recovery between the events things hurt longer and last longer so thats something to factor in
79418 probably the biggest thing thats changed through the years is the level of professionalism
79419 it used to be that sailing was a little more of an amateur sport and funding was a lot less and physical fitness was less
79420 but the whole playing field has gotten much higher the amateur and recreational sailing has gotten pushed aside at the olympic level the time and effort it takes to succeed is double if not triple what it was 12 to 15 years ago its kind of like trying to keep up with tiger woods in golf everything has been raised
79421 im a little more of an optimist and hes a little more of a pessimist
79422 together our personalities work well its huge in this sport its a team effort a 50 50 thing there have been successful teams in the past where the skipper and the crew dont get along but they dont last very long its rare that chemistry that isnt working has success
79423 its such a high stress level to do an olympic campaign to succeed at this level the two parties have to be on the same page you dont necessarily have to have the exact same personalities or likes and dislikes and personal habits but the goals have to be the same the way you go about doing your job to win
79424 theyre some of the friendliest ive met anywhere in the world the quality of living here is nice obviously ive been to a lot prettier places than galveston bay its not the most aesthetically pleasing with the brown water the oil rigs the refineries and its so flat
79425 but the lifestyle and the people make up for any inadequacies in the landscape
79426 for a month i was famous at the grocery store in kemah
79427 its the yellow sea so its very deep with big ocean swells and no wind so were all on diets trying to lose weight athens was windier and steadier this is unpredictable fluky some would say random its difficult to race sailboats because theres not a lot of wind none really
79428 the water is some of the most polluted ive ever seen its not so pleasant to sail in no one would have picked this place except the chinese
79429 but its what we got and were the ones who decided to do this again
79430 he jogged a little bit today i watched him when we were in our individual period
79431 ill have to get back in there and talk to head athletic trainer kevin bastin from what i saw watching him jog i would still think hes a few days away at least
79432 i have to know that bentley can run this football team if something happens to 59 ryans
79433 but what they had been told and what we told them is that were going to play the best three there is a lot of competition just when you think about it from a football standpoint between zac and bentley and lb kevis coley and hopefully chaun get back here quick
79434 he said some real nice things i really appreciate it it was nice of him
79435 he is happy as he can be to be put in a situation to compete for a championship hes ecstatic
79436 definitely playing with tracy ive got a guy that can take over a game
79437 i got my thing i can take over a game defensively
79438 me and shane have been playing together for quite some time every time we played its always a battle when we first played against each other 15 years ago shane used to be way bigger than me i really admire shane because shane at duke was the star and hes still playing defense hitting big 3s and is such important part of the houston rockets thats why i wouldnt mind coming off the bench as a sixth man or seventh man
79439 im one of the top thee or four two way players in the game i do love to play defense i got scoring all around me now i can just contribute
79440 i am happy im always happy i have family a beautiful wife four kids im always in good spirits always happy im blessed
79441 i guess over time you get to know people the first day is the interesting day the next days always get better i dont want to write a book in the newspaper today we will over time
79442 hes definitely one of my favorite teammates ive ever had
79443 you can really tell a lot about a guys character when theyre not doing as good
79444 he doesnt mope around he genuinely roots for his teammates
79445 heres a guy who has won an mvp award and you dont sense any kind of jealousy or competition he really wants everybody to do well sometimes with a star player like miguel thats a rare quality
79446 i just like the fact that his attitude stays pretty much the same whether hes going well or not going well hes pretty much the same guy i met in the spring he still plays hard every day
79447 i think hes played well when you look at overall numbers
79448 when you look at everything hes really better than i thought
79449 we think theres more than enough left in the tank for miguel to be a cornerstone player for us
79450 i love winning i love being on the field every day i love playing hard every day youve got to keep at it every day anything can happen
79451 now that were hitting on the back end of the year im going to focus on the hooters tour as much as i can up until q school maybe sprinkle in a few nationwide qualifiers
79452 ill probably play six seven more tournaments here and then get ready for first stage of pga tour qualifying
79453 its hooters tour a good tour to play because the purses are 200 000 each week four rounds so youre simulating your preparation for q school and the pga tour and thats what im looking for
79454 the scores are not going to be as low as people think
79455 the greens are firm the approach shots as you enter the green are firm so they are bouncing its hard to get the ball close
79456 i know how bad the aggies wanted him and sherman wanted him
79457 but i know that johnny likes the city of houston and is excited about what were doing and the guys that hes working with im lucky i didnt lose him
79458 that was a really difficult decision for me and my family to make
79459 the one thing that made it difficult was i love being here with kubiak i believe in what he is doing here i like the type of coach he is and i like working with him and i made a commitment to him when i came here and i believe we are going to win here
79460 its tough for someone to always be positive all the time and still know how to motivate you we all know during this game not everything is going to be positive theres going to be some negatives to be able to stay positive all the time i just want to commend him for that i know that its all about his upbringing and what type of person and human being he is he just makes you want to do better because you have a coach like johnny holland
79461 that job is a multi tasking job and johnny can do that hes a very smart guy
79462 id walk through hell in a gasoline suit to play baseball
79463 id do almost anything to be playing competitive baseball again
79464 we had some power transformers that exploded some of them were on fire
79465 we had a couple of manhole covers that blew off from the storm surge
79466 it went from one end to the other and just gained speed basically like a locomotive and just came down off the end sheared off the bolts that were holding the stoppers
79467 its finally winding down through chicago and into northern indiana
79468 we are pleased that these two companies have recognized the strong consumer demand for a stevia sweetened beverage and thanks to their highly publicized race to market this relatively obscure herb is now a household word
79469 it makes being first to market that much sweeter as consumers in the u s realize that our product represents the first real option to artificially sweetened sodas while the majors battle it out to get to market first were out there selling zevia but we are concerned that truvia and purevia have strikingly similar names to zevia which may result in consumer confusion
79470 while we are pleased to have our early move into the market affirmed by these beverage giants we are also prepared to aggressively protect our trademark and patents
79471 but those seven questions tell you everything you need to know its not that some men are born cheaters its just that by looking at certain things about a man his life experiences family history character flaws or personality traits can tell you if hes a potential cheater whos prone to infidelity any woman who is married to or dating such a man deserves to know after all forewarned is forearmed
79472 knowing that youre dealing with a potential cheater puts you ahead of the game
79473 if your spouse or significant other is prone to infidelity there are precautions you can take to decrease the likelihood that he will actually have an affair
79474 as we prepare for the general release of the redesigned realtor com and move com web sites we find the latest comscore numbers extremely encouraging
79475 the anticipated impact of the electric security plans would be a one two punch to customers wallets as any rate increases would be on the heels of the higher distribution rates proposed by most of ohios major electric and natural gas utilities
79476 these are dire times for many residential consumers and well beyond just those with low incomes
79477 the decisions made in the coming months through public utilities commission of ohio rules and the utilities proposed rate plans will determine future rate increases we need accountability that the money being requested by the utilities is fair and reasonable the occ will continue to work as part of the ohio consumer and environmental advocates and stands ready to protect the interests of residential consumers
79478 this is uncharted territory in terms of how rates are being set which highlights the need for the occ to protect consumers from any unjustified rate increases
79479 while traditional rate cases involve a year long process consideration of the electric security plans is on a faster timeline
79480 we are proud that our dominator memory once again hit a new world record

79490 we are pleased to be working with guestlogix to drive this evolution in broadway theater ticket retailing as tourists account for approximately 600 million in annual broadway ticket sales it is key for us to make it extremely convenient for travelers to secure seats to our popular shows we look forward to working with guestlogix to eventually expand this program to serve venues in las vegas los angeles and chicago
79491 partnering with broadway veteran shubert to expand our in flight merchandising program to include theater tickets presents a significant growth opportunity for guestlogix
79492 north american airlines currently generate less than a dollar in on board sales per passenger trip however with an average transaction price of over 200 selling broadway tickets provides additional ancillary revenue streams and significantly increases revenue per passenger trip by offering new products such as this on board operators can improve passengers travel experience while offsetting rising operating costs and strengthening their bottom line a value proposition which we believe should prove very attractive to any airline operator flying into the new york city area or other u s cities where shubert provides distribution services
79493 our kids cant wait for their connections academy back to school boxes to arrive
79494 opening up the big boxes is almost like opening birthday gifts its very exciting and a positive way to start the school year the kids just love it and i love to see their enthusiasm about school
79495 the us and the uk must at last come clean about the scope of extraordinary rendition and secret detention a violation of american and british law human rights standards and the rules and regulations of nato
79496 both congress and parliament must set the record straight about what happened at diego garcia phr knows from our twenty one year history of documenting torture around the world that secret detention opens the floodgates to torture and other gross human rights abuses
79497 the bush administrations detainee treatment and interrogation policies have damaged our nations reputation as human rights leader
79498 seven years of secrets whispered in secret rooms must give way to on the record testimony and open hearings
79499 if i feel anything less than glamorous i wont put it in the collection
79500 it is paramount that our members know of this statute and proactively work to protect their interests this supersedes other creditors and will ensure that royalty owners are first in line to recoup any payments in the semgroup bankruptcy filing
79501 royalty owners also need to understand that this proactive step does not ensure they will recoup payment but if they dont take action they will surely loose out
79502 jetzt hab ich verjesse wat ich sache wollte eben hat isch dat noch jewusst
79503 it is great to be recognized as a leader in the space from one of the most respected research companies in america
79504 evisibility truly distinguished itself during our evaluation of the industry
79505 the firm met or exceeded every expectation we have for holistic client centric firms

79507 users and advertising customers alike have been telling us that they want to have access to 411 ca anytime anywhere whether it be on their laptop or mobile phone
79508 right now the visible top line growth outlook in wireless is relatively modest with declining sub gains and so much pressure on voice revenue countering the surge in data
79509 but we think the open endedness of wireless data options especially related to location sensitive and personalized mobile commerce and advertising opportunities could give wireless a second wind in the not too distant future the wireless industrys biggest growth opportunities may well be the services we havent even seen yet
79510 small businesses are simply not being negatively impacted by economic challenges the same way large companies are
79511 the news is dominated by reports about industry giants but the media doesnt see what we are seeing more and more small companies making investments in technology to improve their ongoing efficiency and productivity
79512 forward thinking organizations are looking to manage unexpected problems in real time as well as shifting time wasted on working the internal systems to value added tasks supporting their customers
79513 we have found in agentek a like minded organization who passionately shares our vision of delivering best in class field service management solutions
79514 we are proud that our web based real time scheduling engine met with agenteks exacting requirements for an enterprise class platform and was chosen for their next wave of innovation with field workforce optimization and mobility
79515 the key to mobile excellence is the ability to adjust quickly to changing business conditions ensuring that the right technician with the right skills goes to the right job at the right time
79516 customers turn to agentek to solve the two greatest inefficiencies that plague field service operations responding in real time to unexpected problems and eliminating the large amount of time consumed by working the internal systems rather than working for customers mitigating these two problems dramatically cuts costs improves technician productivity and improves service levels we have found in 360 scheduling the ideal partner to deliver on that promise
79517 for the past two years we have been preparing our organization for true enterprise gis and bridging a tremendous number of data assets weve made a significant investment in data preparation infrastructure expansion and application development to bring an enterprise wide gis to fruition
79518 an important part of that implementation process is ensuring that city employees have simplified access to the tools they need to build and use the system
79519 putting gis software in their hands with the ela assures they can acquire essential tools while nearly eliminating administrative burdens such as conducting complex internal license audits
79520 we are delighted to support the city of houston with this new agreement
79521 this ela will eliminate time consuming efforts to secure critical gis software and instead will allow the city to focus on achieving its vision of an organization wide gis to better serve citizens and staff

79525 we are all conditioned to see modern documentary as propaganda machines but the seasonal nature of agriculture is about the passage of time its sweet harsh triumphant and soul destroying in almost equal doses i wanted a film that washed over you rather than hit you on the head
79526 once we started shooting i realized i was watching the consequences of a global economy unfold in front of my eyes
79527 there were so many i knew adam wanted to evolve music that didnt fall into clich s and although jamaica plays such an important part he didnt want any reggae we listened a lot and identified several themes that worked from there i started to write in earnest adam wanted the music to be an integral part of the story
79528 as a european working in the united states i was well aware of the immigration rules and regulations post 9 11 my own experience made me even more sympathetic to the jamaicans journeys far from home i was also fascinated by the complex global economy that effects even a small farmer
79529 there is likely no profile on the american road more distinctive than that of a harley davidson touring motorcycle and we were able to retain the character of each model while significantly improving the riding experience in many ways with the new v rod muscle and technical and styling enhancements to other models harley davidson motorcycles are leading edge with authentic heritage and original design
79530 we re excited to partner with monster an established leader and innovator in the online employment solutions arena

79533 this was a great team effort working with the lund medical and physics experts to bring this advanced technology to our swedish patients
79534 as a large center treating 2500 new patients yearly we are dependent on high up time and clinical reliability the established and clinically well implemented
79535 instead of two to three days of hospitalization and two months of recuperation typical with open prostate surgery robotic surgery patients often go home the next day and resume normal activities within two weeks
79536 i have seen the number of robotic prostatectomies increase among our patient population over the past couple of years and the benefits are quite clear
79537 these surgeries result in fewer immediate complications and quicker recovery than in an open procedure especially in the hands of a skilled surgeon who performs a high volume of cases routinely
79538 vertical is experiencing rapid growth and requires a platform that enables us to take advantage of market opportunities while also providing the infrastructure for proper management oversight
79539 in addition to commodity xl being the only solution that met all our business requirements triple points biofuel agriculture and energy experience along with its global footprint clearly made it the right choice for vertical
79540 ethanol and bio diesel are increasingly significant factors in a highly inter related global energy mix and suppliers need to manage their risk exposure in relation to agricultural feedstocks and energy outputs commodity xl for biofuels manages the full biofuels life cycle including purchasing processing marketing and logistics

79791 whether they have their own practice or work in someone elses most doctors and dentists are incredibly busy

79803 industry recommendations for dod acquisition of information services and soa systems
79804 the collaboration among industry and government team members was exceptional we had representatives from across the spectrum systems integrators to product houses working with government participants to ensure that this industry was able to provide relevant and useful inputs
79805 unlocking the real power of soa is definitely a team sport it involves a new level of collaboration between government and industry both from a technical and business model perspective the payoff in mission capability and rapid reconfigurability is clear to everyone but doing it well requires all of us to evolve how we play our roles as program managers acquisition experts architects and product and services providers
79806 the unique charter of afei and ndia allowed us to quickly assemble a tremendous breadth of skills and diverse viewpoints from government and industry and we were able to make some concrete recommendations that we believe will help the department of defense advance its capabilities

79824 recently we have seen a marked upsurge in the amount of counterfeit rolex watches out on the market the prestige and quality associated with the rolex brand make it particularly disheartening to see the amount of counterfeit watches being produced
79825 rolex is a marque that has humble beginnings and has been built over the course of 100 years and those that participate in the fake watch business do not appreciate the legacy of a company like this certain models such as the rolex president have been around for over 60 years and the engineering that goes into each genuine example is truly something to be admired
79826 not only does our website have the largest selection of genuine rolex watches for sale on the internet we now have an online resource for detailed picture tutorials for how to inspect a watch and determine its authenticity
79827 it is paramount that all potential rolex watch buyers to fully examine the content of our education site prior to making a purchase from an online rolex dealer
79828 although the internet provides a great forum for purchasing rolex watches the buyer most be very careful who he buys from
79829 methods and systems for account management and virtual agent design and implementation
79830 for example when an account becomes overdue a borrower often needs help to negotiate and manage the account to a favorable outcome research studies show that many as 90 of customers who have an overdue balance would rather respond to an on line agent than a live agent however a simple web site typically lacks a personal touch and fails to make any contact on an emotional level
79831 often a personal or emotional connection is all that is needed to turn a soon to be adversarial encounter into a mutually beneficial negotiation this type of connection can be made more probable with a web site through the use of a virtual agent

79870 at any one time there are more than 150 computers and servers in use on the network so the potential for infection is pretty high when i came on board the school was using symantecs norton antivirus to keep the network clean while the software has a good reputation for ease of use my experience with the product was not too good at keeping viruses out
79871 we contacted the avg us office to ask their advice on who might be the best supplier for us to work with
79872 they pointed us in the direction of walling data because they not only specialized in providing avg products and support to the education market but also offered significant discounts to educational institutions it sounded like a winning combination to me
79873 by the time we came to install avg anti virus network edition on the network we had viruses on 120 of our computers thats 75 of the schools pcs and the infections were spreading like wildfire
79874 it seemed that every time we booted the network another system would fall victim to the epidemic once the avg software was up and running it was busy for 12 to 14 hours quarantining and rescanning all of our computers to make sure that they were clean and free of all traces of the viruses within the first day of buying avg it proved to us that it was money well spent
79875 the decision to switch to avg protection was definitely the right move for us
79876 the software is extremely easy to use and the remote administration tool makes it a simple task for me to check the security status of any machine on the network on the few occasions when ive come across a function i couldnt quite figure out a quick call to walling datas no cost support has cleared things up for me in just minutes wallings service has been impeccable and we could not have asked for a better return on investment for this combination of protection professionalism and performance

79879 we are in a most sensitive period which might bring about a different balance of powers and cost millions of deaths if iran does not immediately stop its preparation for ballistic long range nuclear weapons
79880 if our strength in military power and decisive actions worldwide stops getting stronger and stronger if we dont keep our best allies who are tested worldwide with us if we turn to a european model of society then we will be paralyzed from the strikes of the unions the huge government and the leisure that the left wing is promising to the non productive but demanding individuals

79883 america awake before it is too late go back to the ideals and strengths of your founding fathers and dont change face because god will turn his face away from you and you will be destroyed
79884 historically there has been a separation between an artists music and their merchandise but the line is beginning to blur as artists and labels look elsewhere for revenues
79885 at the intersection of these two markets is a fundamental disconnect nearly all other aspects of the music information about the artist albums songs concert tickets lyrics and ring tones have been digitized correlated and rationalized but merchandise is a mess there is no collective understanding of who where and what is available in terms of fan gear
79886 it appears that for majority of artists merchandise is an afterthought or it may be they are hesitant because its value rarely extends beyond their own web or myspace page
79887 i believe that music merchandise as most people perceive it is dominated by a relative handful of artists when compared with the much larger number of artists found on a typical digital music service
79888 the opportunity to do more with music merchandise is obvious but it needs to be brought into the digitized realm of music to have any chance of benefiting the overall market
