190000 we are waiting for this agreement when we know well know what his situation is we will know what he can give to us
190001 of course big clubs are interested but this is not important first he needs to have an agreement with a club
190002 if he moves itll be to a big club of course there are four or five clubs interested
190003 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
190004 as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it
190005 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
190006 of all the teams we could have had that is one of the toughest obviously we looked at the prospect of facing arsenal liverpool juventus or schalke and we got one of the most difficult
190007 in one respect it is a tough draw for us on the other it is now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us
190008 this is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage to get one of the big teams
190009 it will be a once in a lifetime experience i am sure our fans will be delighted
190010 there were some tough trips in that draw so a short journey to belgium will suit rafael benitez and his side and i think it is a comfortable pairing
190011 liege won the league last season for the first time since 1983 and it will be their first time in the champions league
190012 they have got some good players although there are not any really big names that people in england would know too much about
190013 the brazilian igor de camargo is a threat and they have couple of good young belgian players like steven defour but i do not think they will be able to cope against the likes of fernando torres robbie keane and steven gerrard
190014 athletes have a very low threshold for experimenting with and using performance enhancing drugs and i have no doubt they will be the early adopters of both drugs
190015 the way that you or i would remodel our muscles is through exercise if you lift weights youre going to get stronger
190016 im sure if word gets to beijing quickly there may be some people popping aicar
190017 its possible to make a pill an exercise pill that can actively improve physical performance and endurance without ever having exercised
190018 the boards approval of the additional share repurchase program reflects its confidence in the continued growth of suns business and an ongoing commitment to increase shareholder value
190019 with 3 3 billion in cash and marketable debt securities we have maintained a strong balance sheet and feel confident that this program will allow us to further pursue strategic opportunities for growth

190039 currently each telemarketer is required to maintain its own do not call list which you must register on separately to reduce or avoid calls with the national dncl you will only have to register your canadian telephone number on one list
190040 the national dncl operator will be responsible for registering numbers providing telemarketers with up to date versions of the national dncl and receiving consumer complaints about telemarketing calls
190041 the crtc will grant a 31 day period to allow telemarketers time to update their telemarketing lists
190042 as a result you could continue to receive telemarketing calls until this time has passed

190068 i dont think ema was saying that theres a time and place for a protest i think she was s aying theres a better time and place to be naked
190069 seriously you are voicing your opinion on stating that someone shouldnt be offended by someone being offended
190070 where do these ladies get the idea that they have any right to try to change anyone elses mind by protesting in what is supposed to be a shocking manner
190071 it costs more money to care for and adopt out animals

190077 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
190078 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
190079 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
190080 people have moved from their ancestral homes thousands of people now have no drinkable water no place to live
190081 we want the government to learn they cant do that to people
190082 the government has behaved in a way that respects the treaty agreement to hand bakassi over
190083 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
190084 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 percent
190085 if however the situation on the car markets particularly for preowned cars does not ease over the course of 2008 there is a risk that this could have a negative impact on bmw groups earnings for the year
190086 significantly holding down earnings for the first half of the year
190087 the higher cost of crude oil used in the refining process was not fully recovered in the price of gasoline and other refined products
190088 as a result our downstream operations incurred a loss in the second quarter with most of the loss taking place in the united states
190089 it is all in all only acceptable in view of the duration of the settlement and the performance related one off payment it is imperative however that the increased costs be compensated by higher productivity resolution of the pay dispute on their own initiative by lufthansa and ver di is an important message to our customers as well as our staff and to germany as an economic base
190090 every length to resume flight operations quickly for our customers in the customary reliability and quality
190091 is however provisional on pay parity for cabin crew staff and pending agreement between lufthansa ver di and ufo the flight attendants union
190092 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
190093 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower
190094 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
190095 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
190096 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
190097 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
190098 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
190099 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
190100 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry
190101 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s market
190102 we are in discussion with several different countries states cities and individual companies around the world for future ev electric vehicles partnerships

190104 amid the recent surge in commodity prices and japans aging society
190105 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
190106 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
190107 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
190108 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
190109 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
190110 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
190111 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
190112 in preparation for china coming on strong we want to try to keep their fruit in their own country
190113 its a backdoor way to do it but a necessary one we think

190121 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
190122 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
190123 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly

190127 given the challenging sales environment we are pleased with our second quarter earnings results which came in at the high end of our expectations on an operational basis but were impacted by the one time charge relating to lease accounting
190128 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
190129 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
190130 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a good substitute for exercise training good news for adepts of pulmonary rehabilitation
190131 without minimizing the importance of the quest to optimize the results of pulmonary rehabilitation we had to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation so improved access is important for pr to achieve its full potential from a public health perspective

190159 i want to say this about my state when strom thurmond ran for president we voted for him were proud of it and if the rest of the country had followed our lead we wouldnt have had all these problems over all these years either
190160 look at the costs involved in the martin luther king holiday and that fact that we have not done it for a lot of other people that were more deserving i just think it was basically wrong
190161 the people in this room stand for the right principles and the right philosophy lets take it in the right direction and our children will be the beneficiaries
190162 i accept the fact that i made a terrible mistake ive apologized for it ive asked for forgiveness and im going to continue to do that

190164 we have agreements with the licensees who handle collegiate apparel for those schools and this has been in the works for some time
190165 going to howard where the students are very into academics and also into fashion i thought wow this is crazy
190166 here is another company that doesnt acknowledge black colleges a lot of girls from howard wear victorias secret and work there also it shouldnt have been just those typical schools that come to mind when you think of college
190167 i reached out to her because she was a fan of the brand i wanted her to know that we were not being insensitive and we did have a plan
190168 we have agreements with the licensees who handle collegiate apparel for those schools and this has been in the works for some time
190169 victorias secret and pinks mission is to have relationships with our customers
190170 in terms of distribution through victorias secrets website and catalog in millions upon millions of homes it will be a wider distribution than hbcus have ever enjoyed in any other licensed program
190171 victorias secret has been very good to women like tyra banks and latino models
190172 black consumers are loyal to those companies and brands that are loyal to them
190173 african american consumers want to be recognized and respected by corporations where we spend money and those corporations must remember that they are competing for our dollars
190174 clearly it was a business decision and victorias secret is in the business to make money i know that we spend more buy more frequently and in casual wear we buy more garments per purchase
190175 from a trend standpoint i would say black schools are a very viable audience for victorias secret
190176 it is the type of retail operation that young socially active fashion involved african american women would be attracted to i think this oversight is very unfortunate
190177 i hope my sites feedback shows that young black girls are major consumers of victorias secret

190185 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
190186 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
190187 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
190188 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault

190211 people keep items they receive as gifts that they dont really like the first step in choosing what to display is getting rid of the pieces that dont work
190212 collecting pieces is a natural process whether aware of it or not we are drawn to the same styles and color palettes
190213 when at a flea market or antiquing remember that your selecting has a way of working itself out
190214 two strong colors together can be dangerous because it can come across as tacky
190215 anthropologies mismatched looks go well with all pieces and offer an inexpensive alternative to high priced antiques

190222 the album is more or less all in the bag except for a few minor details
190223 the source revealed a lot of people have been waiting a long time for this album as they do with every
190224 but the word coming out is that the band is very very happy with the end product and when u2 are happy it should be quite a piece of work theyre not easy to please

190233 under this agreement safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods as applied elsewhere in the world
190234 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
190235 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards

190237 i feel i have something to prove and thats why im here

190239 ill be giving everything for the club im here to win games and win points and to help us stay up
190240 its going to be tough but i think the club is gearing up to stay in the premier league
190241 i know one top club in the premier league wanted to sign thomas but their goalkeeping coach moved and we managed to sneak in and get the deal done
190242 hes trained exceptionally well and looks as fit as a fiddle
190243 weve now let thomas go back to denmark because his family is there and the deal was done very quickly

190252 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
190253 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
190254 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
190255 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
190256 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions
190257 the main driving idea is to frame the discussion of leadership equity accountability and partnerships around concrete actionable goals
190258 its time to set specific goals and hold everyone accountable for reaching them
190259 is that beyond rhetoric and philosophical debates the aim of all contributions is to suggest practical ways to move forward in some cases through explicit recommendations in others through directions for shaping or reshaping the environments in which the spread of hiv can be curbed and access to quality care and treatment can be made available to all who need it
190260 it is increasingly clear that despite laudable advances in hiv technologies and outcomes true success is still evasive continually being thwarted by age old issues such as stigma discrimination poverty and lack of accountability
190261 new paradigms are needed for understanding and responding to the aids pandemic and this journal is a timely and constructive source of information for those efforts
190262 taking the leap leadership equity accountability and partnerships in a world living with aids
190263 individuals and institutions were forced out of their comfort zones to forge uncharted territory foster new collaborations explore fresh approaches to scientific investigation redesign facilities curricula and community healthcare and better prepare for future disasters
190264 crisis also gave way to opportunity in the area of healthcare infrastructure
190265 though challenges remain the majority of the health sector in greater new orleans is recovering and reforming
190266 inpatient and outpatient services have been restored but certain populations and geographic areas remain dramatically underserved
190267 we have had time to rethink and reevaluate our response to and preparations for disasters and to rebuild our communities and our personal and professional lives
190268 the commitment to the region and preserving our unique identify is stronger than ever
190269 nobody else no other school has been challenged by issues related to race to the extent we have experienced at ole miss
190270 and probably no university in america has made the progress on race that we have made most objective observers would conclude that our university is a model for the nation
190271 ole miss is a step above every other major institution in america
190272 thats why ole miss is best poised to deal with race they know more about the issue
190273 despite obvious and understandable hostility from some students we had a civilized discussion about the constitution and how our government of laws worked
190274 i have always felt that with that discussion ole miss began to learn and profit from the terrible events of the night before
190275 in our efforts to solve the problems of race and two centuries of discrimination against blacks together blacks and whites have obviously made significant and remarkable progress in higher education ole miss has to its great credit been in the forefront
190276 in many cases ole miss and mississippi are viewed from a 60s perspective rather than a 2008 perspective
190277 when the debate takes place people are going to see ole miss today oxford today and mississippi today this is a wonderful opportunity for that perception to be updated
190278 throughout southern history you have a biracial culture and a biracial way of life you have people from west africa and western europe interacting on an uneven playing ground essentially creating a blend of western civilization and third world life only recently are we really beginning to understand that story its fascinating
190279 on one hand the south has been solidly republican on the other hand mississippi is where barack obama wins primaries
190280 in many ways the south has been the most prosperous part of the country for years at the same time we still have rural poverty underperforming schools and the highest infant mortality rate the complexities of the south are still here
190281 issues like racism and social segregation have not been high on my list of priorities during my time in oxford
190282 i came to realize that my position while convenient was rather narrow minded something really does need to change
190283 there are plenty of problems to be solved one by one they wont happen quickly and you may not notice the difference but my eyes are a little more open this retreat is a step in the right direction
190284 we are saying here is the race story at ole miss here is where we were in 1962 and heres where we are today yes we have a history that includes inappropriate behavior in regards to race but our current state of affairs is a model for the nation
190285 i know there are at least 80 people on this campus who desire change
190286 as members of the ole miss family we have the right and the responsibility to do what we can to make this a place where we all feel connected
190287 it will require communication effort time and patience but the goal of an integrated diverse ole miss is worth the work it takes to get there
190288 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
190289 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications

190335 hes got a dog a doberman pinscher named belle every day he takes belle for a walk in the morning and nearly every morning his neighbor leans out her window or peeks out her door and yells at him shes convinced that his dog is pooping on her lawn now i know my son in law he may not be much of a husband but he takes better care of that dog than he does himself and he always has a plastic bag or three with him to pick up after her

190354 for too many years libya has refused to accept responsibility for its horrific acts of terrorism against american victims but after the pressure we applied libya can finally be held accountable for these devastating events

190375 this is a great way to give back to our industry
190376 there are so many retired racehorses who need loving permanent homes once their careers are over
190377 this is a great way for owners to give back to the horses in the industry and help rerun so that we can make available to them the more humane alternative to auctions plenty of owners care about the future of their retired horses and will make the right choice of placing them in reruns adoption program but we have to have the funds and resources to keep that option open to them

190423 i think it was difficult for him not for me
190424 it would have been better to have the points but it was the beginning of my career in formula one and it was most important to confirm what i was doing as a test driver that was my main target
190425 he had to fight day and night to survive to be able to remain in italy
190426 but what was amazing to me was that from 16 to 21 when he made his first formula one test he didnt change his mentality his strength to be able to make sacrifices hadnt changed and we are still in the same situation formula one is not a goal for robert winning is the goal
190427 i think all people and not only racing drivers but every single person that wants to achieve something when you are in a bad situation you become stronger

190508 then thered be something like crianza and here wines could have been aged for a minimum period of time with wood that is either in it or with it that is staved or chipped but still be for youthful uncomplicated drinking
190509 we could move to a reserva category which could denote an extended period of time in wood note not with wood and that would be made in a style that is structured for three to six years of aging and finally could we also have a category similar to gran reserva for wines which have been crafted to be aged for at least a decade

190511 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
190512 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
190513 thats not the debate were getting out of john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me you notice that i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that youre not real happy with them and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
190514 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me i mean you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down and you know you know this in your own life right if somebody doesnt have anything nice to say about anybody that means theyve got some problems of their own so they know theyve got no new ideas they know theyre dredging up all the stale old stuff theyve been peddling for the last eight ten years but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails and the latest one they got me in an ad with paris hilton you know never met the woman but you know what theyre going to try to argue is that somehow im too risky you know basically what theyre saying to you is we know we didnt do a real good job but hes too risky

190518 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
190519 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
190520 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vot on record as opposing it for some time
190521 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
190522 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
190523 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
190524 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
190525 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out

190553 no amount of processed meat is considered safe to eat
190554 a lot of what we get comes to us from the federal food program and we trust that they do their job make sure everything is healthy and on the up and up
190555 we want to assure citizens that our kids are getting healthy wholesome meals
190556 we care about their food these kids are our responsibility
190557 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
190558 we just want to teach parents and school food services directors about the importance of healthy choices
190559 large amounts of red or processed meat over a long period
190560 there are lots of reasons not to give your children large quantities of processed meats cancer is one but there are better ones like high calories high sodium and high fat
190561 if your child eats hot dogs once in a while i dont think that you need to worry that theyll get cancer
190562 we have stacked up health risks by increasing the volume and the frequency of processed foods
190563 there are alternatives there are schools across the nation that are doing quite well
190564 processed meats appear to have carcinogenic properties or agents that can indeed cause cancer its a real issue
190565 processed meats do play an important role in a balanced diet that includes fruits vegetables grains and dairy products
190566 de politie houdt de zaak ter plaatse wel in de gaten en informeert ons regelmatig over de toestand maar er is voor ons geen reden om dringend een beslissing te nemen
190567 we gaan dus geen druk uitoefenen op die bezetters of ons opwinden we wachten even af een politie interventie is de eerstkomende uren dan ook niet aan de orde

190570 leerkrachten worden gedwongen slecht gedrag te bestraffen en de opvoedende rol van ouders op zich te nemen scholen worden meer en meer gevraagd om taken op zich te nemen waar ze niet verantwoordelijk voor zijn zoals het beperken van obesitas bendevorming en alcoholmisbruik bij minderjarigen
190571 ouders zijn eerder bezig met hun carri re en minder met hun rol als fulltime ouder de laatste 15 jaar zijn de standaarden op gebied van opvoeding bij ouders heel wat veranderd ik kan het wel begrijpen moderne ouders hebben te maken met veel stress en druk van buitenaf het was veel makkelijker om ouder te zijn in 1970 dan nu maar ook de media zijn verantwoordelijk zij promoten slechte woorden en adverteerders gebruiken kinderen om producten te verkopen ook de waarden en normen zijn veranderd mensen zijn egocentrisch geworden en minder met anderen en de gemeenschap bezig

190577 i dont think its fair for her to say that bishops respect their wives how could any bishop condone domestic violence
190578 i dont think we see things like that in the church what she said is far removed from the real picture
190579 i dont think its true the church speaks out against this
190580 in the wider community these things still exist but we dont do that as bishops or pastors
190581 she is being unfair shes talking from a general view without any evidence
190582 i stated unequivocally that i never said nor would i say that clergy in the third world beat their wives
190583 i told them of the context of what was quoted and told them of what had been omitted i apologized for anything i might have said that led to misunderstanding toward my brother bishops or jeopardized already difficult ongoing conversations at this conference
190584 the anniversary of the bridge collapse is this friday and the convention isnt for a month after that the two things arent really related
190585 a tragedy of that kind raises national visibility to those kinds of decisions
190586 they are based on a bunch of different factors and the weight nominees give to them
190587 i would certainly hope that while members are in minnesota they would visit the new bridge and reflect on the countrys need for infrastructure funding
190588 everyone is very careful about not making the i 35 bridge an issue
190589 gov rendell and mayor bloomberg wanted to highlight the infrastructure issue but didnt do it in a way to involve the bridge both were sensitive that people died there
190590 it takes away flexibility from the states to spend the money where its most needed
190591 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next 4 months
190592 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
190593 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
190594 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
190595 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
190596 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
190597 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
190598 but obviously they were historically inaccurate african american presidential candidates like jesse jackson shirley chisholm carol moseley braun and al sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns and no one would call them inarticulate
190599 i deeply regret any offense my remark in the new york observer might have caused anyone
190600 that was not my intent and i expressed that to senator obama
190601 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking

190604 were three guys with a lot of attitude and no budget making the line up with cnn aol mickey kaus wired magazine and david cameron is pretty gratifying
190605 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
190606 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
190607 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
190608 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
190609 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
190610 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
190611 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

190618 weve got two paid staff who make 85k between them and get no benefits while the democrats have six paid staff making 450k between them with full benefits how can we compete with that
190619 the way i feel is this i feel liberated and im just going to tell you as plainly as i can why i no longer am going to have to carry the water for people who i dont think deserve having their water carried
190620 the wal mart human resources managers who run the meetings dont specifically tell attendees how to vote in novembers election but make it clear that voting for democratic presidential hopeful sen barack obama would be tantamount to inviting unions in
190621 i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
190622 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval

190628 die unternehmen reduzieren die stundenzahl nach wie vor st rker als die besch ftigung so sanken die durchschnittlich geleisteten wochenstunden von 33 7 auf 33 6 stunden und damit auf den niedrigsten stand seit juli 2003

190636 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
190637 i think they should probably be a little less paranoid about parsing every word we say and a little more focused on actually addressing the challenges that americans expect the president of the united states to take on
190638 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party
190639 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
190640 they heard something that senator obama said and they felt they had to respond quickly to make sure that nobody got the impression that they were engaged in those kind of racial politics

190683 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it politic vanity asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because ones conscience tells one that it is right

190707 the recent decision by a federal judge of the southern district of new york which has put a final end to the attachments of the bank accounts of the bolivian telecommunications company entel attachments sought by the italian company euro telecom international eti manifests an unquestionable legal support for the firm conviction of bolivia to determine the management and administration of a strategic sector of its economy according to the principles of sovereignty self determination and fairness and respect for foreign investments
190708 judge swains ruling establishes a very clear precedent for sovereign nations pursuing a policy of nationalization as well as for investors who may seek to challenge the execution of that policy
190709 her decision prevents foreign investors from going outside the arbitral process to obtain an unfair advantage by freezing bank accounts as well as from putting undue pressure on sovereign states to compel settlements on terms dictated by the investors
190710 eti has brought an arbitration action against bolivia not entel and the attached bank accounts in new york undisputedly belong to entel not bolivia plaintiff has made no proffer as to how the monies in entels new york bank accounts constitute an attachable debt obligation of entel to bolivia the order of attachment will therefore be vacated

190863 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
190864 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
190865 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
190866 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
190867 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
190868 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
190869 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
190870 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
190871 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
190872 the instinct is what some are calling the iphone killer as it has features such as a touch screen interface full qwerty keyboard gps a music player that has the ability to call text or surf the net full html browser watch movies mega pixel camera with 4x digital zoom and video camcorder
190873 voice and data plans include the 10 unlimited mobile browser add on data plan that allows unlimited internet not data access
190874 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
190875 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
190876 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
190877 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
190878 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
190879 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
190880 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
190881 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
190882 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
190883 federal public safety minister stockwell day said the full weight of the law must be brought to bear on the perpetrator we want to make sure the process is followed as aggressively as possible the full legal process day said from levis que where conservative mps are gathered for a summer planning session
190884 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
190885 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
190886 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
190887 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
190888 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
190889 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
190890 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
190891 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
190892 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
190893 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
190894 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
190895 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
190896 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
190897 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
190898 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
190899 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
190900 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
190901 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
190902 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
190903 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
190904 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
190905 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
190906 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
190907 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
190908 if you want a congressman who represents 5 percent of the people then by all means vote for doc
190909 but if you want a true republican i am the standard they need to rise to
190910 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
190911 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
190912 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
190913 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
190914 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
190915 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
190916 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
190917 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
190918 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
190919 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
190920 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
190921 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
190922 who are open to doing something on the production side
190923 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
190924 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
190925 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
190926 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
190927 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
190928 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
190929 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
190930 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
190931 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
190932 the scared straight crime prevention program which imprisons delinquent teens for a short period in the hopes of deterring them from a life of crime while the teen is there a riot breaks out and prisoners take him hostage
190933 have you ever been in a relationship where there are so many problems that you should just break up but its something you just cant let go

191002 looking at properties piece by piece as zane mentioned that doesnt provide a lot of predictability
191003 are we telling owners that they have to be perpetual stewards of land they can do nothing with
191004 the developers that have the easiest time will be the ones that come up with creative solutions

191176 indeed the very redevelopment project that sparked the kelo lawsuit an effort by the town of new london ct to turn its fort trumbull waterfront into a haven for high priced homes and 21st century jobs has sputtered the ground where susette kelos home stood is now barren because the townhouses that the city sponsored developer was supposed to build there have never gone up interest in the area isnt very great and the developer hasnt been able to get financing in fact what began more than a decade ago as an extravagant public private scheme to redevelop this whole area around tourism research and development and luxury residential uses has produced little except ongoing construction on a 17 million coast guard station

191188 i am absolutely clear in my mind that firstly we do not stand in the way of scots having their choice i do believe they will continue to choose to be part of the united kingdom
191189 but secondly there is no blank cheque for mr salmond for my support in relation to what his proposals are until i see the details of what he is saying
191190 we need to build the machine that is required to take mr salmond and his party on

191444 new nuclear build is supposed to be a central part of the governments energy strategy but it seems to be dependent on the decisions of foreign companies over whom it has absolutely no control
191445 disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
191446 time is not on our side as the government has left it very late to give a firm direction for nuclear we need a clear resolution quickly as further delays might make it difficult to fill the looming energy gap
191447 it is pathetic that a government minister who not only controls 35 of british energy shares and who also has to commit public and consumers money to guarantee the future viability of the industry and who represents the public interest when it comes to licensing and planning should allow himself to be pushed about by british energy shareholders who simply want to cash in on their ownership of licensed nuclear sites
191448 hutton has got to get a grip and put the interest of the uk public who foot the bill before the self interest of the shareholders
191449 this takeover would have taken us back to the old days of a state subsidised monopolised nuclear power sector

191682 junto a un pasajero que estaba durmiendo y escuchando m sica
191683 de repente o un grito cuando me volv vi al atacante de pie con un cuchillo de supervivencia apu alando al otro pasajero 50 60 veces corr hacia el conductor y le dije que parase el autob s que alguien estaba acuchillando a un pasajero
191684 todo el mundo se baj mientras el atacante con toda la calma del mundo cortaba a la v ctima
191685 cortando tranquilamente a la v ctima casi lo hab a decapitado y lo estaba destripando
191686 but artificially inflating their mood may not be as good an idea as one would expect it to be if you believe the conventional wisdom that happiness is always the best thing
191687 theres a heightened sense of importance that comes through tension and actually makes a person interested in a task its not just a matter of something being sold as positive
191688 so its very possible the sad music created tension in the children and made them focus more
191689 ive always wanted to be a nurse since i was 5 and i had my tonsils out
191690 comments like a smart girl like you should have gone to medical school well that just sends me into orbit because i personally wouldnt want to be taken care of by a dumb nurse
191691 you want the people who take care of you to be as smart as you can possibly get
191692 one of my main career goals was to communicate to the people how very important nursing is to the health of our nation
191693 i offer them the opportunity to make an investment in something fabulous
191694 this sets us apart from every other rural area in this nation
191695 this shows were willing to invest in things that will make southside and southwest virginia play a role in getting this nation and this world to cut the spigot off of this foreign oil supply it makes us stand out from every other region of this country
191696 this is a broad and diverse range of projects that should be able to leverage private sector funding as well as federal state and local dollars
191697 with this funding 8 million the center can be built the research is ongoing
191698 im excited because the scientists and researchers will be coming here i think thats important
191699 im very excited about this investment in clean coal technology
191700 not only is coal an important valuable resource here in southwest virginia finding ways to help us meet our environmentally sensitive goals is also very important
191701 but 36 million is a pretty big investment im very excited but at the same time they need to prove themselves well see how this first round of funding is utilized
191702 it was in part a show of good faith that we would consider miami for significant jewel events given the imminent construction of a ballpark and that an agreement had been reached
191703 there is insufficient evidence and a fatal weakness in the crowns case
191704 i have never seen jill dando in the flesh in any shape or form
191705 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
191706 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
191707 at the first appeal the court of appeal considered it to be a sound identification case whilst at the second appeal the court allowed the appeal on a very narrow point concerning the firearms discharge residue which was not used this time but ordered that a retrial should take place
191708 the fact that the trial ran its full course confirms that although it has changed in detail the circumstantial evidence in this case which has been tested over and over again by the courts was judged fit to be put before a jury
191709 only a 40 watt bulb when it is completely lit
191710 i became aware through photographs of jill dando prior to her death that she was very similar to princess diana
191711 her public persona invited affectionate feelings by the audience or by the viewer the same as princess diana
191712 here is a woman who is very open affectionate extroverted who communicates affection to other people and when people do that they tend to invite that same kind of reaction
191713 sadly these are also the kinds of women in public life who are stalked
191714 there arent many certainties in the economy but wed offer good odds that this does not mark the start of an improving trend
191715 overall pretty awful but were still waiting for a blockbuster plunge in headline payrolls it will happen sooner or later

191750 eurand is an ideal partner for us and cyclobenzaprine er is an excellent fit with our portfolio providing us the opportunity to offer physicians and patients the benefits of convenient dosing and low rates of sedation we believe theres a substantial market opportunity in south korea for this once daily muscle relaxant

191752 we are very pleased that addax petroleum chrome and kogas have initiated this project in conjunction with our countrys policy direction for gas and gas master plan this is a significant step forward in the development of nigerias substantial gas resources and its continuing economic development the combination of domestic and international interests in the consortium together with the involvement of the bayelsa state government also signifies the confidence of the respective communities in our plan and the bright future of nigeria
191753 we are extremely proud to be an early participant in nigerias gas master plan and to have received the approval of the federal government this is an important milestone for addax petroleum in the development of the considerable gas resources in our licence areas in nigeria we believe that the strong relationship between addax petroleum chrome and kogas brings together the vital and complementary international and domestic expertise required for our consortium to play a significant role in realising nigerias gas plans additionally we believe this proposed project will provide significant benefits to nigeria and its people by way of power generation employment creation and substantial foreign direct investment

191790 although in the heat of a midwestern summer it might be difficult to discern the festival of lammas august 1 marks the end of summer and the beginning of fall the days now grow visibly shorter and by the time weve reached autumns end october 31 we will have run the gamut of temperature from the heat of august to the cold and sometimes snow of november and in the midst of it a perfect midwestern autumn
191791 it may still feel distinctly like summer outside but aug 1 has long been celebrated by some europeans as the beginning of fall known to some as lammas and others as lughnasad the festival of the harvest is most commonly celebrated by baking a loaf of bread from the seasons new grain supply although predating christianity the celebration has been incorporated into church traditions as well as the first loaves of bread were brought to mass on aug 1 from whence the name lammas loaf mass is derived in addition to the celebration of the years bounty some traditions also incorporate a farewell to the sun as the days become shorter and the nights cooler whether the celebration is spiritual or merely symbolic theres something to be said for reconnecting with the seasons and with the sowing growing and reaping of food in our community sitting in air conditioned cubicles and commuting by car we can so easily become separated from the natural world that we have little chance to recognize the rhythms of nature which were so essential to our ancestors
191792 the first ripe fruits in ireland in august are the bilberries a cousin of the north american blueberry
191793 in modern times this agricultural core of the festival is all that has survived but formerly when celtic lands were under native rulers l ghnasadh was the occasion of major assemblies where legal matters were settled political problems were discussed craftsmen artists and entertainers got a chance to show off their talents and sporting events brought scattered communities together

191817 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
191818 in seguito a questi violenti attacchi abbiamo dovuto sospendere le attivit e evacuare tutto il nostro personale da tawila e shangil tobaya
191819 stata una decisione difficile perch questa sospensione delle attivit lascia le persone prive di assistenza medica ma impossibile per le nostre equipe lavorare e fornire assistenza medica senza una minima garanzia di sicurezza e senza il rispetto per il lavoro degli operatori umanitari

191830 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
191831 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
191832 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
191833 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
191834 die unternehmen reduzieren die stundenzahl nach wie vor st rker als die besch ftigung so sanken die durchschnittlich geleisteten wochenstunden von 33 7 auf 33 6 stunden und damit auf den niedrigsten stand seit juli 2003
191835 folglich sank das arbeitsvolumen also das produkt aus besch ftigung und stundenzahl im juli um 0 4 prozent gegen ber dem vormonat gemessen an dieser gr e verst rkte sich somit die konjunkturelle abschw chung zu beginn des dritten quartals

191841 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
191842 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
191843 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
191844 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
191845 die lage am arbeitsmarkt ist zwar schlecht und eine trendwende zum besseren ist auch noch nicht auszumachen die dynamik des stellenabbaus hat sich aber nicht versch rft
191846 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
191847 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
191848 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
191849 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
191850 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
191851 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
191852 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
191853 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
191854 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

191857 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
191858 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
191859 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
191860 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

191865 weve reformed mental health we have the biggest higher education bond program weve expanded pre k youre not going to have a 1000 batting average but the way you get votes is you just push and you push im not afraid to do that
191866 i kind of had this feeling that everybody knew what they wanted to do but i didnt
191867 people want to know what your motivation is for me its my faith
191868 that was strengthened in my experience in honduras i just want to serve people i know it sounds like a simple clich
191869 the cost of a keyword is determined by what the advertiser is willing to bid and the quality score of that ad meaning how relevant that ad is
191870 its a free market and john mccains campaign has said very publicly that theyre investing resourced into online advertising
191871 the cost of a keyword is determined by what the advertiser is willing to bid and the quality score of that ad meaning how relevant that ad is
191872 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
191873 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
191874 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
191875 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
191876 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
191877 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
191878 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
191879 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
191880 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
191881 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
191882 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform
191883 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
191884 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
191885 using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues
191886 this is a race about big challenges a slumping economy a broken foreign policy and an energy crisis for everyone but the oil companies
191887 barack obama in no way believes that the mccain campaign is using race as an issue but he does believe theyre using the same old low road politics to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign and those are the issues hell continue to talk about
191888 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
191889 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
191890 on a day when major news organizations across the country are taking sen
191891 pointing out your opponents worldwide celebrity is not the low road and neither is pointing out that he opposes oil drilling and supports higher taxes
191892 my independence hasnt always made me friends in washington i was not elected ms congeniality in the united states senate
191893 my concern with sen obama is that on issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
191894 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
191895 you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down
191896 we cant really know what sen obamas thinking was at the moment he canceled the visit but we know that the campaign was at least considering sending a reporter with him and when the pentagon said that wouldnt be allowed he decided against making the visit
191897 it seems fair to ask whether obama canceled because hed been denied another spectacular photo op on a trip that was about nothing but photo ops
191898 but we know that the campaign was at least considering sending a reporter with him
191899 an individual can easily donate online and otherwise and if theyre dishonest or overenthusiastic they can lie about who they are and what their status is to make an unlawful contribution
191900 if a contributor lies to campaigns thats outside the control of the campaigns
191901 thats a lot of legal risk for a lousy 2 300
191902 i respect and admire sen obama but we have stark differences
191903 given the seriousness of the issues youd think we could have a serious debate
191904 but so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton and britney spears i mean i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that really what this election is about is that what is worthy of the american people
191905 americans dont like presidents who think they are better than the average guy
191906 has dishonored himself and brought discredit to the house and merits the censure of the house for same
191907 instead of keeping their promise to drain the swamp of corruption in washington house democrats are sinking in it
191908 im asking the minority to allow me to join in with them in this resolution to say this matter should be cleared up but theres no need even for mean spirited people in the minority to say that im a discredit to the united states congress
191909 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
191910 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
191911 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
191912 there is no more reliable source of electricity than coal
191913 this is about protecting record oil company profits not production
191914 wont get a vacation from high gasoline prices so congress shouldnt take a vacation until we vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil
191915 its a shame on congress that we are going in recess when we have to deal and have not dealt with the issue of high energy prices
191916 it appears the democrats are desperate to deny real gas price relief they are apparently united behind the misguided policy of the presumptive democratic nominee for president who says dont provide any new sources of supply
191917 this isnt about production as republicans keep wailing on the floor this is about republicans protecting record oil company profits not production
191918 this is not about helping the american consumer its about one last chance to give out more handouts to big oil
191919 all of a sudden after a lifetime opposing offshore drilling now you are for drilling and 1 1 million dollars ends up in your coffers i think the oil companies understand very clearly where their bread is buttered
191920 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
191921 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
191922 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
191923 senate republicans feel that we both need to find more and use less and that in order to have a piece of legislation that actually passes the senate we need to have an open process
191924 he has shown no interest in doing anything but continuing more of the same failed policies that have produced the highest oil and gas prices ever
191925 im coming to china as the president and as a friend
191926 i know its best for the u s china relationship that i go
191927 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the u s side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to the anti china hostile forces
191928 the chinese government very much appreciates president bushs support for the beijing olympics but they cannot abandon the chinese position on other matters
191929 the matter of dissidents is quite sensitive and the foreign ministry always makes strong protestations when dealing with this kind of affair
191930 an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
191931 the resolution exposed the malicious intention of a handful of anti china lawmakers to politicize interrupt and sabotage the games
191932 presents the chinese with an opportunity to demonstrate compassion on human rights and freedom
191933 china would like to continue to exchange its views with the united states on basis of equality mutual respect and non interference in each others domestic affairs
191934 what youll see is better systems put in place to check for dangerous products
191935 we are going to be working hard to assure people of the safety of toys this season
191936 there continues to be evidence of taliban and haqqani network involvement in the indian embassy bombing as well as the attempted assassination of afghan president hamid karzai
191937 you will find folks who will say there is significant penetration of the isi by terrorist elements and thats a serious concern
191938 but others are saying that certainly theres penetration but we dont think its top to bottom
191939 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
191940 cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
191941 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
191942 measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
191943 if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
191944 anytime you can keep a dollar at home thats good
191945 if you have commercial attractions like theme parks local people may often go there but theres a lot more to a city than that like local cultural events that people might just ignore because they take them for granted
191946 this is the first time that the city has actively called on new yorkers to discover their backyard
191947 but fox 5 picked it up new york 1 picked it up our ceo was on bloomberg radio it seems to be a message thats very relevant
191948 to experience your local environment in a way that you have not before requires you to break everyday patterns and to do that you need to open your consciousness
191949 its really cool and i didnt know anything about it until a visitor told me which is ironic because i work right there
191950 my parents are visiting soon and the pins make me want to learn more about the whole campaign before they come
191951 the hope for ips cell technology is that you could create cells from your own body to treat your own defects
191952 i believe maria would be alive today if the marine system had been different
191953 terrorists should be perceived and described as criminals not holy warriors and our analysis suggests that there is no battlefield solution to terrorism
191954 with the growing number of attacks and an expansive reach one could argue al qaeda is even growing stronger
191955 we are winning the war on terror in fact weve almost won the war on terror
191956 measuring the total number of terrorist attacks globally from a us national security perspective is meaningless because most of those groups are not targeting the united states
191957 to be effective against terrorism in many ways requires the same things that are needed to be effective against crime its knowing neighborhoods good intelligence and on the ground information exactly the kind of information we lacked in iraq the first three years of the operation
191958 this is whats so difficult about terrorism its a blend of political and just plain old criminal justice stuff
191959 the adversarys real center of gravity is its narrative and we have to find ways to facilitate it falling on its own weight
191960 al qaeda has made its colors very clear people see it for what it is a violent ideology that will kill anything and everything in its way to meet its so called objective
191961 its unraveling even some of the intellectual thinkers within the movement are peeling away the justification and credibility of al qaedas narrative
191962 the british have long since dropped any reference to a war on terror in part because of their long standing experience fighting the irish republican army
191963 where they became increasingly successful is when they started using special branch their counter terrorism police force as well as mi 5 their domestic intelligence service its the use of those two actors together that really helped penetrate the ira not the military
191964 i want to make a request if at all possible that the trial be in october so that he can clear his name before the general elections
191965 i am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that
191966 the senate ethics committee does not comment on pending matters or matters that may come before the committee absent special circumstances it has been the longstanding policy of the committee to defer investigation into matters where there is an active and ongoing criminal investigation and proceeding so as not to interfere in that process
191967 american people have every right to expect the highest ethical standards from every member of congress the american people deserve better and i would hope that all members would exhibit the kind of ethics the american people expect
191968 never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a u s senator
191969 in accordance with senate republican conference rules i have temporarily relinquished my vice chairmanship and ranking positions until i am absolved of these charges
191970 knowingly and willfully engaged in a scheme to conceal his continuing receipt of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of things of value
191971 you must be the change you wish to see in the world
191972 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
191973 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
191974 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
191975 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
191976 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
191977 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
191978 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
191979 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
191980 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
191981 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
191982 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
191983 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
191984 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
191985 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
191986 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
191987 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
191988 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
191989 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
191990 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
191991 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
191992 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
191993 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
191994 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
191995 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
191996 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
191997 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
191998 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
191999 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
192000 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
192001 vamos a recuperar el banco para ponerlo al servicio de los venezolanos de toda la econom a venezolana nos hace mucha falta un banco de esa magnitud
192002 una negociaci n completamente respetuosa y normal sin ning n tipo de problem tica especial

192006 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
192007 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
192008 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
192009 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
192010 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
192011 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
192012 leading up to the weekend we have a chance of scattered thunderstorms
192013 we have an isolated chance of severe thunderstorm with damaging wind gusts
192014 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
192015 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
192016 aber da der markt zur zeit immer nach schlechten us daten sucht und daf r zuletzt nicht so richtig eine best tigung gefunden hat profitiert der dollar jetzt und auch am aktienmarkt wird es mit gewisser erleichterung aufgenommen
192017 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
192018 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
192019 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
192020 siemens hat bei den verhandlungen starken wert darauf gelegt dass wir den rund 2 100 mitarbeitern eine gute perspektive in einem starken unternehmen mit zukunft bieten
192021 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
192022 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
192023 theres too much work to do if we can get it all done then well have time to play

192027 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
192028 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
192029 i have an invisible adviser but i have decided to represent myself
192030 i do not believe there is anyone who doesnt know that i am in detention
192031 my commitment was to withdraw even from literary life and all sorts of public life
192032 its an old story by one of the worst mass murderers in the world and its completely untrue
192033 there was no deal it would have been immoral illegal and disgraceful
192034 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
192035 i think were getting things right most of the time now
192036 our footprint of activity now extends from mosul to basra
192037 if the leadership returns and you have a couple of major attacks things could reverse
192038 i think they are in disarray quite frankly but they are still capable of attacks the guidance i give my commanders is to not get complacent and to make sure we continue to take these capabilities from them
192039 as were fighting we need to train enable mentor and advise our iraqi counterparts
192040 no doubt over time we will be in an advisory role but you cant flip a switch and then today were in combat and tomorrow were advisors
192041 when youre going into a dark room at midnight and you know that someone on the other side wants to kill you its a war when you have a mother who receives her son in a coffin its a war
192042 ignoring the problem is only going to make it worse
192043 ignoring the problem is only going to make it worse
192044 that billion dollars is really just a down payment because we dont have a true handle of what the costs are going to be
192045 ignoring the problem is only going to make it worse
192046 if they want to solve the problem theyd best not wait around for washington
192047 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
192048 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
192049 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress
192050 indeed the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process
192051 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
192052 the practical significance of the opinion will depend chiefly on whether the investigations persist into the next congress and on how the new administration responds
192053 interesting questions yet presented about the authority of an ex president to make even qualified executive privilege claims on behalf of his former aides
192054 could have saved themselves a lot of trouble if they had allowed these aides to go to the hill to testify to show they were willing to play ball
192055 there are no two issues more current and more salient than our energy situation and our national security
192056 this is proof positive that democrats are well aware of the fact that the energy issue presents a significant political liability for their members
192057 we will definitely raise these issues as an element of our normalization process
192058 im not in a position at my level to state to you today what the specific conditions of normalization will be

192063 its reign as the least cost effective and worst performing road system

192067 theres a defect in the foundation and a structural beam in the foundation that makes it unsafe
192068 since it cost a lot to win and even more to lose you and me better spend some time wondering what to choose

192082 the television station was owned and run by the milosevic family and was deliberately targeted by nato using a cruise missile because it was seen as the main purveyor of serbian state propaganda
192083 jill dando by this stage had become one of the if not the face s of the bbc in short she was the personification and embodiment of the bbc
192084 the murder certainly hadnt been planned and carried out in just three days but the police did not examine the theory in its broader context or seriously consider that it might have been planned weeks in advance
192085 on april 11 milosevic began striking back at his perceived enemies in the media
192086 claims of responsibility are made by groups such as the ira or eta in 60 years there has not once been a claim of responsibility for an assassination carried out by east european secret services
192087 when i look back at peters career hes never had the balls to challenge or make a move or actually move to get the job in circumstances where he could have got it
192088 im not saying he cant come back but the polls still say hes largely unelectable
192089 im absolutely determined with everything that ive ever done in my life to see it through

192094 there is a possibility that from a cyclical perspective a downturn may have begun late last year
192095 my biggest worry is price hikes driven by rising raw material costs
192096 the united states needed to rein in a massive trade deficit

192100 theres about 53 nations that dont have gdps gross domestic products as large as the one quarter earnings that exxon just had countries youve heard of too like the philippines and hungary
192101 so now we have a company thats earned more than any other company has ever earned in a single quarter and were disappointed because we thought they were going to earn even more
192102 i wish theyd give back some of that money to us so i could enjoy gas at a lower price and not stress out

192342 aaa minneapolis supports minnesotas new state law prohibiting text messaging while driving which goes into effect on august 1 but clearly the crisis of distracted driving which leads to hundreds of traffic crashes and driving deaths each year is a big issue in the twin cities which includes text messaging while on the road

192351 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications of our threats that voting democrat and the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits

192361 hmm another article showing that inflation is understated and real growth overstated
192362 that alleged 1 9 percent growth depended on the ludicrous assumption that inflation was just 1 1 percent at an annual rate
192363 if you instead deflate the nominal gdp growth of 3 0 percent with the 4 3 percent increase in the gross domestic purchases deflator then growth was 1 2 percent

192389 in solchen f llen ist der generalsekret r der verfahrensbevollm chtigte des spd parteivorstandes
192390 nur weil er einen fehler gemacht hat darf man ihn nicht ausschlie en
192391 allerdings wird die kommission auch die politische biografie eines sozialdemokraten zu w rdigen haben der spd landesvorsitzender war der ministerpr sident war und der nicht gez gert hat dem ruf nach berlin als bundesminister zu folgen

192405 ole is an inspiration to anyone hoping for a long career in football
192406 in the modern day game anyone who manages 10 years or more at one club is exceptional particularly when that one club is not from the players own country
192407 when the fans show their respect for ole tomorrow it will not just be for his goal in barcelona it will be for his overall contribution over a very long period of time
192408 ole came to us at 23 but i looked at him and thought he was 15
192409 i told him he had potential but his first season was going to be an introduction and mostly he would be playing for the reserves
192410 but after two games reserve coach jim ryan said i needed to put him in the first team
192411 we made him a substitute against blackburn the following week he scored and was never out of the first team squad after that
192412 that last league championship summed up oles strength of character
192413 it was never going to be easy after all those operations
192414 but we gave him the platform and he just kept working away in that gym believing he would come back when i dont think anyone else thought he would do it
192415 but once we introduced him to the team his impact was fantastic he got 11 goals which were really important for us in the end
192416 when a young kid walks in here eventually i want them to go home to their mother and father and be the same person

192430 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
192431 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vot on record as opposing it for some time
192432 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
192433 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits

192437 it is now trying to mitigate the damage this move by the government reflects the reality the need to control the intelligence agencies in pakistan the need to say that the policies of pakistan are made by the civilian government and not decided anywhere in the ghq general headquarters in rawalpindi or in the isi headquarters
192438 the fact that there is a reversal sends the message that nothing can be done without the consent of the military without the consent of the isi itself and this message doesnt help gilani in one sense he gilani reinforces the perception that these forces the pakistan army and the isi act independently and that the political government is not necessarily responsible for it
192439 they the government are powerless against it and no one wants to cooperate with someone who is powerless
192440 we all know that it is going to take time to do something meaningful i think that what has been understood now is the fact that in the long term there is no real solution without the predominance of the civilians over the military the past eight years have proved that a military government is a disaster ultimately pakistan is much worse off today with all these issues and in the security situation as well

192564 if they bully me then i will stay in beijing to have a press conference every day
192565 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
192566 during games time we will provide sufficient and convenient internet access
192567 i also now understand that some ioc officials negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked on the basis they were not considered games related
192568 the battlefield forward position for the propagation of advanced socialist culture
192569 i would be disappointed if i couldnt point to a big juicy deal by christmas
192570 the ratings upgrade is motivated by chinas improving fiscal and external position
192571 these improvements to the government balance sheet will offer greater resilience to deal with the shocks of a potential sharp economic downturn
192572 we are facing a lot of challenges and pressures in launching mobile service but we will take advantage of the synergies between fixed line and mobile services
192573 cdma has been losing market share since 2005 to be able to achieve that china telecom will not only have to reverse the trend but double its market share
192574 we are concerned a positive legacy from the beijing games is in danger if urgent measures are not taken
192575 the air quality today is not up to what the world will be expecting from an olympic host city
192576 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhances all social conditions including education health and human rights
192577 police efforts to clean up beijing have swept human rights activists out of sight the police have used the olympics as a pretext to extend the re education through labour system
192578 not of much value if impressive environmental achievements are confined to the venues and the duration of the games
192579 my victory has proved that athletes with yellow skin can run as fast as those with black and white skin
192580 56 lucky clouds to symbolise well wishes to the world from chinas 56 ethnic groups
192581 offers a tremendous opportunity for beijing to effectively communicate with the world about its vision of the future
192582 we must give full play to the superiority of the socialist system and organise and mobilise the masses to wage a peoples war for the protection of olympic games security
192583 extremists and activists among the tibetan independence groups falun gong evil cult organisations common citizens who are discontented and international terrorist forces
192584 china is not acting as a responsible olympics host when it blurs so much of the actual terrorism risk
192585 china has left little space to publicly express different viewpoints
192586 that may have driven a small segment of uighurs towards supporting violence
192587 there is a big information vacuum that makes judgments quite speculative but we do not think there is an increased likelihood of something happening in beijing because of the olympics
192588 it is widely expected that china will soon be the third main jurisdiction for competition law together with the eu and us
192589 the competition landscape in asia and beyond will change markedly once the new regimes are in place in china and india but what impact the new regulations have on business and deal making will depend a lot on how they are implemented
192590 the greater certainty which the new laws should bring to this field will not in itself create significant business opportunities for foreign investors greater opportunities may come from any parallel process of liberalisation in restricted sectors
192591 in india deal sizes are growing larger and turnover is rising quickly in that context these threshold levels are set far too low
192592 certainly such big offshore deals will get a close look in china as elsewhere and it would be reasonable to expect some such deals to raise issues requiring a closer look and thus some delay in china as elsewhere
192593 if these draconian powers had been in place two years ago then deals such as corus would never have taken place commerce doesnt wait 210 days tata would have lost that deal the indian bureaucracy is far too slow
192594 the new laws will sooner or later stop a high profile overseas acquisition by an indian company then all hell will break loose and the government will be pressured into changing the regulations
192595 people need to be made aware that they shouldnt be talking to their competitors about pricing and other matters
192596 competition law is still a very new thing in china or in asia generally
192597 but as a result our association was banned by the government
192598 we would like to help workers organise but thats the governments job we are just trying to make workers more aware of their legal rights
192599 before this year we handled about 10 cases a month
192600 you began to see the political shift in 2006 when the consultation period for the labour contract law started
192601 that was the official signal that enough was enough the situation had gone too far it wasnt a harmonious society it was the opposite
192602 negotiations went slowly because everything had to be approved by wal mart headquarters
192603 but the process was quite smooth it does not compare to the effort involved in establishing the first wal mart union two years ago
192604 i see changes in the shenzhen acftus attitude it wants to provide better service
192605 if i were an acftu official i wouldnt have been able to sleep
192606 the labour contract law presented acftu with a big opportunity
192607 there were over 400 workers with more than 10 years service in the factory
192608 i wrote to acftu but it wouldnt help then we turned to ngos and i led more than 100 people to the district labour bureau to complain
192609 they said i was illegally trying to organise my own trade union which was not true
192610 i am just a normal person who knows how to protect himself and help others

192618 im currently packing up really quick to hop on the plane and head to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let all of you know first that theres no chance of me competing in beijing
192619 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
192620 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
192621 after taking a few different exams and mris this morning the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
192622 there are so many mixed feelings because last night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
192623 but on the other hand this is something that needs a lot of time to heal which really hurts me to say that i have to miss the olympics
192624 john mccain has many many wonderful qualities but i think a barack obama victory would do fantastic things for the confidence and the feelings of black people around the world
192625 eles levaram cerca de r 5 mil quatro telefones celulares e as chaves de quatro t xis

192638 sustainability is in the dna of the university of oregon
192639 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
192640 but it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
192641 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the agreement is of indefinite duration there are no conditions for discontinuation other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself
192642 there were many statements of support for the plan but also many statements with concern and questions but no one openly opposed it
192643 the u s put undue pressure on many countries not to raise concerns but they were raised today
192644 many in the iaea meeting wanted to put these concerns on record for the nsg

192650 die abk hlung hat schon hunderttausende menschen get tet wenn sie weiter voranschreitet und keine ma nahmen ergriffen werden wird sie weltweite hungern te weltweites chaos und weltkrieg hervorrufen und das kann alles noch vor dem jahr 2000 eintreffen

192652 die globale erw rmung ist ein falscher mythos und alle ernsthaften personen und wissenschaftler sagen das
192653 ich pers nlich kann nicht mit gutem gewissen weiterhin an einem prozess teilzunehmen den ich sowohl als motiviert durch vorgefasste agenden als auch als wissenschaftlich unsolide ansehe
192654 ich bin seit 1978 in der betrieblichen klimatologie und ich kenne dutzende und dutzende von meteorologen im ganzen land ich kenne keinen einzigen tv meteorologen der der menschengemachten global warming hysterie glauben schenkt ich wei dass es ein paar da drau en geben muss aber ich kann sie nicht finden milliarden von dollars flie en in die geldbeutel die auf den global warming zug aufspringen
192655 die globale erw rmung wie wir sie kennen existiert nicht und ich bin nicht der einzige der den menschen die augen ffnet dass sie die wahrheit sehen aber wenige h ren hin trotz der tatsache dass ich einer der ersten kanadischen doktoren f r klimatologie war und einen erheblichen hintergrund in klimatologie habe besonders in der rekonstruktion des historischen klimas wenige h ren hin obwohl ich einen doctor of science von der universit t von london habe und klimatologie professor an der universit t von winnipeg war aus irgendeinem grund eigentlich aus vielen h rt die welt nicht zu das ist in der tat die gr te t uschung in der geschichte der wissenschaft das beweist dass konsens kein wissenschaftlicher fakt ist was ich in meinem pers nlichen leben w hrend der letzten jahre erlebt habe l sst mich verstehen warum die meisten menschen sich daf r entscheiden die wahrheit nicht auszusprechen die sicherheit des arbeitsplatzes und die angst vor repressalien
192656 but they report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains we have made
192657 things look so much better than a few weeks ago that i think we are near to reaching agreement
192658 i dont think it will take months were looking at more like days or weeks
192659 it just feels so much safer than i ever thought it would
192660 we dont really go out anymore looking to go and fight the enemy things are stabilized so now were working more on helping the economy and getting people on their feet
192661 the fires of kirkuk will eat all iraqs cities and even the americans
192662 my soldiers ask me that every day i heard a rumor theyre reducing our deployment is it true
192663 when we used to walk the streets in april they were empty and we would be destroying buildings used by enemy positions
192664 now we walk the same streets that were covered in sewage and rubble and utter destruction and they are vibrant and full of people
192665 as the situation improves it feels more like the race is almost finished
192666 compared to youre in the middle of the race and you have a long way to go
192667 i knew it was safer but i refused to believe it i still had the same image of trash filled streets and decaying buildings when we drove through the city that first night i was in shock
192668 we are still in a country where there are people who wish us harm so i cant say i feel completely safe
192669 you can expect the doom game to look like its developed with the next generation graphics technology
192670 i can tell you there will be guns i can tell you there will be blood i can tell you there will be demons i can tell you there will be gibs in other words i can tell you its going to be kickass because it couldnt be anything else right
192671 wed always back ourselves but we know its going to be difficult
192672 theres so much at stake not just in financial terms but in terms of prestige the competition in england is going to be an incredible experience and wed like to be there
192673 the fact that it looks like there is going to be a third place with the likelihood of zimbabwe withdrawing then it takes a wee bit of the pressure off
192674 it means if we lose in the semi final then were going to have a second chance to qualify that third and fourth place place off game will probably be the most tense match of the entire competition
192675 in the twenty20 format anything can happen but i think ireland and scotland are the two favourite sides because they are playing in familiar conditions while we are coming from hot conditions
192676 we have worked extremely hard in england on a pre event tour and have made sure we have all the resources and have all bases covered
192677 we have a strong squad with players who are ideally suited to this form of the game
192678 in john blain and dewald nel i feel weve got the best new ball attack among the associate teams its such a bonus to have guys who take wickets up front and they do it consistently to peg back the opposition
192679 i open the batting in the one day format and i see no reason to change that gavin hamilton has started to open and has done quite well well also have navdeep poonia and kyle coetzer available from the counties so we have options
192680 our former captain craig wright misses out as he has a back injury that combined with the loss of gordon goudie means that there is an opportunity for the others to step up
192681 an opening fixture with ireland in ireland is about as tough as it gets as a tournament opener this should be a great one for fans of both countries
192682 i wasnt originally supposed to be in the squad but weve had a few injuries and ive been asked to come back in and help out
192683 were in a tough group but then there are no easy fixtures when you are at this level canada and kenya are strong teams but you have to look at yourself and your own strengths if we play to our potential then we will be hopeful of making it our focus is of course to finish in the top three
192684 the millennium development goal of reducing by one half the proportion of people worldwide who live on less than 1 per day
192685 promoting the reduction of global poverty and the elimination of extreme global poverty
192686 each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the developing countries and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0 7 percent of its gross national product
192687 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
192688 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
192689 nobody else no other school has been challenged by issues related to race to the extent we have experienced at ole miss
192690 and probably no university in america has made the progress on race that we have made most objective observers would conclude that our university is a model for the nation
192691 ole miss is a step above every other major institution in america
192692 thats why ole miss is best poised to deal with race they know more about the issue
192693 despite obvious and understandable hostility from some students we had a civilized discussion about the constitution and how our government of laws worked
192694 i have always felt that with that discussion ole miss began to learn and profit from the terrible events of the night before
192695 in our efforts to solve the problems of race and two centuries of discrimination against blacks together blacks and whites have obviously made significant and remarkable progress in higher education ole miss has to its great credit been in the forefront
192696 in many cases ole miss and mississippi are viewed from a 60s perspective rather than a 2008 perspective
192697 when the debate takes place people are going to see ole miss today oxford today and mississippi today this is a wonderful opportunity for that perception to be updated
192698 throughout southern history you have a biracial culture and a biracial way of life you have people from west africa and western europe interacting on an uneven playing ground essentially creating a blend of western civilization and third world life only recently are we really beginning to understand that story its fascinating
192699 on one hand the south has been solidly republican on the other hand mississippi is where barack obama wins primaries
192700 in many ways the south has been the most prosperous part of the country for years at the same time we still have rural poverty underperforming schools and the highest infant mortality rate the complexities of the south are still here
192701 issues like racism and social segregation have not been high on my list of priorities during my time in oxford
192702 i came to realize that my position while convenient was rather narrow minded something really does need to change
192703 there are plenty of problems to be solved one by one they wont happen quickly and you may not notice the difference but my eyes are a little more open this retreat is a step in the right direction
192704 we are saying here is the race story at ole miss here is where we were in 1962 and heres where we are today yes we have a history that includes inappropriate behavior in regards to race but our current state of affairs is a model for the nation
192705 i know there are at least 80 people on this campus who desire change
192706 as members of the ole miss family we have the right and the responsibility to do what we can to make this a place where we all feel connected
192707 it will require communication effort time and patience but the goal of an integrated diverse ole miss is worth the work it takes to get there
192708 most people correctly see no simple solution when it comes to reducing prices at the pump
192709 that doesnt mean that it wont be an important issue when it comes to the general election more than 70 percent of respondents said the cost of gasoline was either very important or somewhat important in their voting decision this november
192710 he stayed strong stayed extra long til they let all the other boys out now weve got a real man with an american plan were going to put him in the big white house
192711 i wanted to offer him something that he didnt have a rally song one that really captures that maverick spirit
192712 he was physically tortured for years and yet he gets out of bed every day and serves our country for decades

192749 our athletes do their best under relatively poor conditions bih political authorities do not invest much in sports so the athletes cannot fully dedicate themselves
192750 i am really honoured but i would rather be the one who will carry the flag at the closing ceremony because that duty will go to the athlete who achieves the best result at the games
192751 you will have our gratitude whatever results you achieve at the olympics we have full confidence in you and we wish you all the best
192752 theres no question the challenging u s macro environment has hindered our ability to increase revenues
192753 interest rates will not remain high for ever we will get out of the trough they interest rates will moderate and go back to normal rates hopefully in about six months to a year
192754 banks have an opportunity to mitigate the burden of high interest rate by reducing the cost of money so that they are not obliged to raise interest rate every time the monetary policy is tweaked he said there are ways in which banks can take care of the bottomline even while mitigating the burden of high interest rate upon borrowers the banks must explore those ways
192755 instead of employing and appointing a branch manager banks can appoint a business correspondent without employing one a business correspondent is a barefoot banker and a low cost branch manager who can bring new business by mobilising deposits and create opportunities to advance money

192759 last week senator obama skipped a visit with wounded u s troops at landstuhl regional medical center in germany because the pentagon would not allow campaign staff or media to accompany him into the hospital i served as director of trauma surgery at that hospital for nearly four years and saw the effect that a visit from a celebrity like senator obama could have on morale during that time i do not recall a single member of congress canceling a visit with the troops despite being just a few hours away but senator obama seems to have been more concerned with how the visit would affect him than how it would affect the soldiers recovering from wounds received in the service of their country
192760 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
192761 weve found a gene that is key for proper chloroplast function this finding might some day help scientists develop plants that grow better and can serve as more nutritious food
192762 we have now shown that an analogous process is required for proper chloroplast function
192763 moreover without fro7 plants sown in iron deficient soil died as young seedlings our findings are of particular interest because how iron gets into chloroplasts has not been well understood despite the significance of iron in chloroplasts
192764 enriching crops with mineral and vitamin nutrients will provide sustainable solutions to malnutrition
192765 we are increasing a plants efficiency for water uptake plants that can sense water in a better fashion will be higher in economic value in the future
192766 we are developing plants that are more efficient in sensing water
192767 polls show people dont want to hear people yakking on a long flight
192768 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
192769 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
192770 if breeding a new fruit with a specific trait is like finding a needle in a haystack then mas is like having a metal detector
192771 our breeding programme with zespri generates many thousands of seedlings every year
192772 the genus actinidia to which all kiwifruit belong is incredibly diverse and contains many colours shapes flavours and other attributes beyond the two most prominent industry cultivars the green fleshed hayward and yellow fleshed hort16a better known as zespri
192773 hortresearch has a collection of 23 species of kiwifruit and many more can be found in china from where kiwifruit originated were now better placed than ever to unlock some of that natural resource and deliver it to consumers
192774 the work involved in identifying these ests plus research that has been done to investigate their use in ongoing breeding programmes proves new zealands world leadership status in kiwifruit science
192775 hortresearch breeds kiwifruit exclusively for zespri and the new zealand kiwifruit industry it is a relationship that has already seen the breeding and highly successful commercialisation of zespri tm gold kiwifruit and now looks poised to deliver more exciting fruit to the marketplace
192776 this science is a great fit with our natural breeding strategy which is committed to delivering high quality all natural kiwifruit that offer consumers health convenience pleasure and a guarantee of 100 natural goodness

192788 the first arm of defense against this disease is to educate them
192789 but now more than ever before the church holds a solution to the hiv aids epidemic
192790 i joke about being a 70 year old woman giving out condoms
192791 when its my time i want my obituary to say that i have made a difference for someone and that i saved somebodys life
192792 i thought i was so fat i was 130 pounds
192793 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
192794 honestly i just dont know how that happens whether it would happen in a person i dont know i think its a small miracle it happened at all
192795 it would be better to do exercise than to take a pill
192796 ik wilde ja zeggen tegen charly op mijn blote voeten in de weelderige tuin van de brabantse boerderij van mijn moeder maar het weer kan in augustus nogal onbestendig zijn en ik zie het niet zitten om in een klamme tent ons feest te geven
192797 maar gelukkig alleen met leuke dingen ik zit tot over mijn oren in de opnames van
192798 want we zijn beiden niet gedoopt er komt geen christelijke dienst het was mogelijk om tegen het decor van de kerk voor de wet te trouwen
192799 de beste vriend van mijn ouders die ik mijn peetoom noem is bisschop van een vrij religieuze gemeente zijn overtuiging staat voor respect voor mensen in de breedste zin van het woord het maakt niet uit wat je gelooft als je maar met eerbied omgaat met mensenrechten ik heb een eigen religieuze beleving ik geloof in het goede

192801 britney has made clear to everyone that she does not want to be further harassed or contacted in any way by osama sam lutfi now or at anytime in the future
192802 i met him once and he was very kind to me i never got a chance to tell him what i thought that he was my hero
192803 this is one of the secret awards i wanted i was hoping this would happen in my lifetime and it did
192804 they dropped down the age to enlist to 18 i signed my mothers name and she was not happy about that
192805 i never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director
192806 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
192807 im not trying to be my father hes irreplaceable im simply trying to do something that i think theres a real niche for that theres a calling for that has to do with youth not just in the election but in politics from now on
192808 what ensued was a very messy scene where the anesthesiologists could not reintubate the patient and the surgeon could not establish
192809 an indictment albeit at an unfortunate time politically for the hospital on the nursing and respiratory care at sharp grossmont
192810 the patient did have complications post surgery in icu coded and expired
192811 there is no evidence at this time the tube was dislodged and definitely no information regarding lack of observation
192812 i honestly believe this message is coming from an individual who has a history of conflict with our management a man who has intent to harm sharp grossmont publicly
192813 medical record keeping was purposefully watered down to avoid stating what actually happened and to avoid a formal inquiry and autopsy
192814 including minute by minute patient monitoring data in the recovery room during which time mr houtkin
192815 i would likely have brought the case in for autopsy
192816 was ist denn schon wieder wolltest du nicht ein paar tage ruhe geben

192823 i would use it on chicken and ground turkey burgers
192824 would use it on less expensive meats trying to cut back a bit on the grocery bills lately so we have been using less expensive cuts but doctoring them up with various sauces and such this would be perfect for that i blogged about your giveaway also http robynsonlineworld blogspot com 2008 07 great blog found from giveaways html

192842 i can imagine that childs response to a demand to open up authentication to the fiberwan would be why so you can screw it up and bring the city network crashing to a halt i can even imagine that under so much pressure hed take steps deleting or hiding config backups for instance to make sure he was the only one in control
192843 the safety of gerber and nestle nutrition products is our top priority
192844 we are taking this issue seriously and are cooperating fully with federal authorities
192845 our main reason for doing this is were trying to cut down on the black population

192851 best paid actor i no marriage for hilary duff and joel madden
192852 the hard part for me was this situation with manny derailed into a train wreck so quick so fast and so oddly
192853 we had a conversation a little while back talking about what he should do and how things are gonna go and theres just really not a reason from a business standpoint for the red sox to do anything right now why would they given your age and the contract situations why would they not just kind of wait and see how things played out i think there was maybe theres some feeling on his part that if he did what he did last winter and he came out and had a monster first couple of months that theyd sit down and say ok we want to keep you here the next four years lets get something done and it felt like to me that the second he realized that that was not an option this just went straight downhill
192854 its well known lore that clacking these sticks together will keep the zombies away
192855 because im pretty sure that is straight out of the parent trap right there someone played you honey
192856 why dont you tell me how i am supposed to kill a zombie
192857 oh my god was that just zombie speak for how youre going to kill me
192858 no sorry i tried talking with peanut butter in my mouth
192859 what i was trying to say is that it is common knowledge that you could have easily killed all these zombies with one swift blow to the neck with your axe there
192860 in that respect the negative cash flow in the second quarter is overstated
192861 were going to get the second quarter behind us and just move ahead
192862 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
192863 it was fun when we were older too of course but when i was a child with my brothers that was really something
192864 we started playing country western but my brother loulou who played the drums complained because there nothing for him to do
192865 see load drums to that and you get rock and roll
192866 i know john lennon then playing backup for the tony sheridan band saw us perform a lot of the british did but id never dare say we influenced them

192874 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
192875 yea war go team go freedom go kill all the dirty rotten bastards
192876 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
192877 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
192878 one of the concerns we plan to share in the closing days of the conference is the absolute

192897 but you bethlehem ephrathah though you are little among the thousands of judah yet out of you shall come forth to me the one to be ruler in israel whose goings forth are from of old from everlasting
192898 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
192899 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
192900 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
192901 instead of rivers we have roads rather than water theres traffic as a result 21st century toronto is being turned into a city of islands a series of barely connected neighbourhoods separated by multi lane urban highways
192902 im really excited about the boards vote of confidence in me
192903 this is a new change for me and im anxious to get started
192904 when i looked at her resume and saw her background in special education and science it really excited me
192905 her people skills really impressed me and we look forward to having her on board here
192906 this includes work to all existing doors into the courthouse
192907 a third door located across from our office will be a keypad entrance to allow law enforcement personnel the ability to egress and regress with prisoners
192908 we are inviting everyone from the area to attend were going to have lots of food and the lottery has said it will be giving away several different items
192909 our standard of living is changing because of the high gasoline prices but we should also be concerned because things are coming together that should be disturbing to the american people we are in real jeopardy as far as national security
192910 a comprehensive bill that would undertake an apollo like project focused on clean reliable and domestically abundant energy alternatives
192911 john f kennedy recognized the fact we were vulnerable when he became president and instituted the apollo program and put a man on the moon within seven years we need to look at the same commitment on energy
192912 we are looking at a 750 billion total deficit next year and a 10 trillion national debt we are sending 600 billion overseas to countries who dont like us countries like venezuela
192913 if i ran a business i would be seeing the person with the oil controlling my prices they have also loaned our country money and are now controlling our debt since 2001 70 percent of our debt has been controlled by china japan and the opec nations
192914 we are really on thin ice as far as our national security we have a major problem during the next 10 years we need to harmonize our environment energy needs the economy and national security there is no real reason why this country cant become less reliant on foreign oil
192915 when t boone pickens testified before the senate recently he said the saudis told him we should be going after our own oil we have three times the oil the saudis have if this country let the world know we were going to start going after our own oil we could be at the top of the barrel instead of the bottom of the barrel and be less reliant on foreign oil
192916 we won the cold war but the russians are coming back and using energy they are now talking about an energy partnership we need to wake up and do what we can do sooner than later
192917 that would send a real ripple through the rest of the world we would see a change in the cost of oil no one believes we have the guts to go after our own oil the democratic leadership is afraid to vote on an appropriations bill before we go into recess so we are stalled
192918 im hoping all hell breaks loose over this issue we have not harmonized on energy the economy and environment its something we need to do very soon
192919 we have a right to at least have a debate on the energy issues what is wrong with having a debate on the issue people are frustrated
192920 there is a lot of speculation out there that we are seeing some slight decrease in the price of oil and thats good but the experts suggest the apollo type energy program i am suggesting where we go after our own oil will make a huge difference
192921 we as americans are doing a better job of reducing our demand for foreign oil we need to practice more conservation we need to seek more oil within our own country and see less demand for foreign oil
192922 if hugo chavez of venezuela does something crazy i dont know what could happen in our country eighty percent of the worlds oil flows through unstable countries i certainly dont want to take the risk of being at someones mercy
192923 we need to open up the outer continental shelf to safe exploration allow exploration of the arctic national wildlife refuge which could increase our domestic oil reserves by more than 10 billion barrels of oil and utilize the vast u s and canadian reserves of tar sands and oil shale as well as coal that can be converted to synthetic fuel and used in place of conventional petroleum in fact the united states has more oil shale than saudi arabia has proven oil reserves and we have the largest coal reserves in the world
192924 oil company profits are something we should be concerned about but a percentage of those profits is used to drill for more oil
192925 we should be pushing for alternatives to oil as well such as wind solar nuclear clean coal technology and natural gas we need to push all alternative forms of energy we should move forward on those other energy sources
192926 we also need to make a strong commitment to reduce emissions in the future and we need to look at the future of nuclear energy if we are going to become less oil dependent in the future

192940 eine schwierige aber l sbare aufgabe wir d rfen den gegner nicht untersch tzen aber nach meinem gef hl m sste tiflis in etwa so stark wie zuletzt tobol sein
192941 segrt war zu gemeinsamen rieder zeiten mein erster trainer als profi unter ihm habe ich dort sofort gespielt und bin bis heute mit ihm in kontakt
192942 es gibt keine alibi gegner mehr wir m ssen alles geben um den aufstieg zu schaffen
192943 ich kenne den gegner noch nicht doch es wird sicher kein spaziergang wir haben einen verein wollen ber denn man dr berkommen kann unser ziel haben wir schon vor saisonbeginn formuliert und es hat sich nicht ge ndert wir wollen zum vierten mal in serie die gruppenphase erreichen
192944 von den m glichen gegnern die auf uns gewartet haben ist das eine machbare h rde
192945 wir werden unser gutes netzwerk aktivieren und alle quellen anzapfen
192946 f r kontinuit t und f r ein ruhiges klassisches projekt mit klaren strukturen
192947 f r alle positionen die man in diesem saal bekleiden kann
192948 wir brauchen keinen heuler der in zehn jahren nicht mehr zeitgem ist
192949 das ist eine ziemlich komplexe sache wir sind immer noch dabei die umst nde zu analysieren
192950 dadurch kann es auch sein dass es zu mehr berholman vern kommt
192951 derzeit sind wir aber noch in einem anfangsstadium der tests
192952 ich habe auch beim fahren nicht allzu viel gesp rt es waren nur 30 kw die wir zus tzlich gehabt haben
192953 wir stehen seit den fr hen morgenstunden mit dem oc und dem internationalen tennisverband itf in kontakt ich telefoniere st ndig zwischen peking und london hin und her
192954 es gibt keine m glichkeit mehr die frist war der 23 juli auch wenn jetzt noch ein platz vom internationalen verband angeboten werden sollte und das irgendwie m glich w re unsere nominierung ist abgeschlossen das ist definitiv und mit pr sident leo wallner abgesprochen
192955 wir tragen eine gro e verantwortung f r den patienten zeit seines lebens
192956 die frau nahm spontan die h nde des patienten und sagte
192957 es wartet ein sehr wichtiges spiel auf uns denn es geht um die tabellenf hrung und platz eins ist unser gro es ziel
192958 der lask spielt mit einem 4 4 1 1 system vorne spielen mit vastic und mayrleb zwei routiniers vastic kenne ich nat rlich von der em
192959 ich habe geh rt dass der lask sehr beweglich und mit viel mut nach vorne spielt
192960 zwischen den partien liegen 75 stunden normalerweise braucht ein fitter spieler 60 bis 64 stunden zum regenerieren au erdem haben wir gegen bananz nicht vollgas gegeben gegen den lask werden wir das tun
192961 wir haben berhaupt keinen druck salzburg ist eine internationale supertruppe mit 30 klassespielern sie haben mehr qualit t und substanz als wir das wei jeder in unseren reihen f hlt sich niemand als favorit
192962 wir m ssen mit mut und selbstvertrauen dagegenhalten und frei im kopf sein es kann alles passieren
192963 zulegen kann man immer unterm strich z hlt aber immer nur das ergebnis
192964 wir stehen derzeit gut da aber die tabelle interessiert im moment doch keinen auch mich nicht es sind erst vier spiele absolviert und es werden auch schlechte partien und r ckschl ge f r unsere junge truppe kommen damit m ssen wir dann umgehen k nnen
192965 wir hatten sechs sieben riesenchancen waren 90 minuten klar besser nur haben wir unsere chancen vergeben und dar ber haben wir gesprochen
192966 das ist mir egal wir waren ja in altach auch favorit
192967 dann bin ich berzeugt wird sich auch wieder der erfolg einstellen
192968 sturm spielt derzeit einen sehenswerten fu ball den man gern anschaut die grazer sind kombinationssicher und heimstark wir m ssen alles geben was in uns steckt
192969 ich erwarte eine hnliche partie wie gegen den lask und bin optimistisch wir haben die klasse um auch in graz zu bestehen
192970 das habe ich noch nie gemacht aber es war mir in dieser situation einfach ein gro es bed rfnis
192971 sturm ist gut drauf doch auch wir besitzen wieder mehr selbstvertrauen die chance lebt dort drei punkte zu holen
192972 k rnten ist berall sehr forsch aufgetreten und hat eine hohe leistungs und laufbereitschaft gezeigt wir d rfen uns davon aber nicht aus der ruhe bringen lassen das ist eine tolle truppe mit gutem zusammenhalt
192973 es wird schwieriger als gegen die austria die spielen mit der wut im bauch
192974 er muss sich erst akklimatisieren wird sicher noch zweieinhalb wochen brauchen
192975 drechsel ist unverzichtbar ihn werden die k rntner sicher auszuschalten versuchen
192976 mir hat das wehgetan und wir haben auch daran in den letzten tagen gearbeitet
192977 wir waren schon in unseren ausw rtsspielen gegen austria rapid und lask die bessere mannschaft jetzt muss es endlich einmal mit punkten klappen
192978 die rieder haben eine sehr starke mannschaft das habe ich gesehen als ich sie gegen kapfenberg und die austria beobachtet habe
192979 diese aussagen lassen nur den schluss zu dass all jene zweifelhaften aktientransaktionen die in den tagen vor der hauptversammlung mit unterst tzung von board mitgliedern und des externen investment managers karl heinz grasser sowie beteiligter finanzdienstleister und investmentbanken stattfanden m glicherweise insidertransaktionen waren
192980 es ist davon auszugehen dass die zust ndigen aufsichtsbeh rden diesen pl tzlichen strategiewechsel des mip boards und die damit zusammenh ngenden umst nde entsprechend pr fen und bewerten der vorwurf die unabh ngigen aktion re seien nur heuschrecken und wollten das unternehmen seiner eigenst ndigkeit berauben richtet sich nun endg ltig gegen jene die diesen vorwurf erhoben haben

192985 what the hell are they thinking my password was obtained illegally my money was taken without my consent again illegally how exactly can they determine that this was not an instance of unauthorized anything
192986 this will be a tremendous opportunity for me to work with staff and membership to showcase the associations unique problem solving capabilities as ffva clearly differentiates itself with its value added products and services
192987 ffvas membership is innovative creative and passionate about producing quality safe products products that are grown by those whose attitudes certify they are true stewards of the land those products are handled and distributed in a manner that makes them some of the most trusted in any retail or consumer chain
192988 to be closer to that effort is exciting and a welcome opportunity

192990 we are proud that our dominator memory once again hit a new world record our proprietary technology used on dominator ddr3 allows for incredible overclocking results we believe our technology is far superior to any other when it comes to overclocking memory modules

192992 theres no going back now were very happy with how the art style is the art teams happy the companys happy we really like this art style and were not changing it
192993 not in all dungeons but there might be in some i think people really remembered it in like one or two places where it was prevalent in diablo ii but forget that it almost didnt exist in the other 90 percent of the game
192994 but if we can find one dungeon where its really good to use it and we can create a lot of gameplay out of it and make it look cool then yeah well do it
192995 how should i have been thinking to solve that problem
192996 how should i have been thinking to solve the problem in this fine way
192997 all theory is against the freedom of the will all experience is for it
192998 first have something to say second say it third stop when you have said it and finally give it an accurate title
192999 although the risk management program seems to have picked them up quickly which is good the impact on neurologist take up puts our forecasts at serious risk
193000 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year
193001 wir sind von der iaaf informiert worden dass ihre proben von trainingskontrollen im mai 2007 und bei der wm 2007 in osaka nicht bereinstimmten
193002 mir ist aber wichtig dass in einer gesamtbetrachtung sowohl pers nliches verhalten als auch die politische lebensleistung in die beurteilung einbezogen werden
193003 in solchen f llen ist der generalsekret r der verfahrensbevollm chtigte des spd parteivorstandes besonnenheit und verantwortung sind das gebot der stunde
193004 ich h tte es nie f r m glich gehalten dass das recht auf freie meinungs u erung in der partei willy brandts so gering gesch tzt wird
193005 pflicht aus gr nden der solidarit t und solidit t mein wort zu erheben wenn in meiner partei unverantwortliches vertreten und gar in regierungspolitik umgesetzt werden soll
193006 the dancers are amazing and i think the top 20 will blow the american dancers away

193008 ive always loved coming back and inspiring the kids because thats how i learned and grew to the next level
193009 plus its my hometown and i love coming back its nice to get away
193010 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
193011 the method should make it feasible to store large amounts of energy obtained from renewable sources that are not available 24 7 such as solar or wind the hydrogen could also be used as a clean fuel for cars whose exhaust would be just water vapor
193012 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
193013 ich bin unendlich traurig dass ich in peking nicht spielen kann
193014 aber es gibt keine chance dass ich rechtzeitig gesund werde
193015 ich wollte eigentlich direkt nach peking fliegen aber jetzt lasse ich die sache zun chst in europa von rzten untersuchen
193016 even pelosis own california neighbors oppose her efforts to block new drilling far off american coasts
193017 i will not give the administration an excuse for its failure
193018 im not going to be diverted for a political tactic from a course of action that has a big picture view a vision about an energy independent future that reduces our dependence on fossil fuels and focuses on those renewables that are protective of the environment
193019 a solid majority of americans want us to have more drilling for more american made energy and they arent going to take no for an answer
193020 speaker pelosi senators harry reid and barack obama are defying the will of the american people and theyre doing so at their own risk
193021 republicans feel like they have an opening because of the gas price issue to push for domestic drilling but we havent seen any empirical evidence or tangible evidence that its hurting democrats
193022 maybe this fall the issue will develop into a republican advantage but i dont see that were there yet
193023 its a battle of messages between the two parties more than an anvil around the necks of democrats
193024 in an article in the guardian jamail noted that refugees from fallujah told him that
193025 some artillery guns fired white phosphorous rounds that create a screen of fire that cannot be extinguished with water insurgents reported being attacked with a substance that melted their skin
193026 nos sup rieurs nous avaient dit que comme on luttait contre des terroristes la convention de gen ve ny avait pas dapplication
193027 i saw in falluja with own eyes a family that had been shot by u s soldiers the father was in his mid fifties his three children between ten and twelve years old in the refugee camp a teacher told me she had been preparing a meal when soldiers stormed their dwelling in falluja without preliminary warning they shot her father her husband and her brother then they went right out from fear the woman remained in the house with the dead bodies in the evening other soldiers came who took her and her children and brought them out of the city those are only two of many tragedies in falluja
193028 par exemple le groupe estime que les fatwas mises par le conseil des oulemas en afghanistan clamant que les kamikazes nauraient ni vierges ni vie ternelle ont t bien plus efficaces que les tonnes de tracts de propagande largu s par laviation am ricaine
193029 the fact that the levels of violence have come down so significantly and stayed down now for some two and a half months indicates there is a degree of durability
193030 ich denke das los ist machbar ohne den gegner zu untersch tzen
193031 warschau oder bern w ren schwierigere gegner gewesen unsere zielsetzung ist klar wir wollen in den uefa cup
193032 der dritte platz den gy r in der vorsaison erreicht hat spricht f r die qualit t der mannschaft wir werden gy r beobachten lassen und uns videomaterial besorgen aber unser ziel kann es nur sein die n chste runde zu erreichen
193033 bei allem respekt vor dem gegner m ssen wir uns durchsetzen und die 1 hauptrunde im uefa cup erreichen
193034 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
193035 wir haben uns ganz auf die abstimmung f r das rennen konzentriert
193036 ich bin verwirrt und traurig das ist eine schlimme nachricht f r die fecht welt
193037 sollte er sich falsch verhalten haben muss er bestraft werden sollte jedoch die analyse fehlerhaft sein muss er rehabilitiert werden
193038 ich bin berrascht mit so etwas habe ich berhaupt nicht gerechnet das ist schlecht f r den fechtsport
193039 jetzt wird doping auch im fechten zum thema da kommt jetzt eine ffentliche diskussion auf die wir berhaupt nicht gebrauchen k nnen
193040 furosemid kann so ziemlich jede substanz maskieren die im urin nachzuweisen ist und mit einem bestimmten grenzwert kontrolliert wird stimulanzien nandrolon morphin und andere dinge es kann innerhalb weniger stunden zu bis zu zwei litern fl ssigkeitsverlust f hren
193041 so der 20 j hrige franzose aus dem red bull junior team
193042 skizziert franck mailleux aber ich erwarte dass viele fahrer mit allen mitteln versuchen werden in die top 20 zu kommen und im zeittraining mehr alseinen neuen satz benutzen werden daher muss man auf den punkt sehr schnell sein wenn man neue reifen f r das rennen aufheben m chte
193043 sagte coach veh die schwaben verschliefen vor 9500 zuschauern die anfangsphase
193044 aber der trainer wei doch dass es f r einen brasilianer normal ist dass er zu sp t kommt
193045 ich wei wo ich hinschie e wo der torwart hinl uft ist mir egal
193046 ich bin unendlich traurig dass ich in peking nicht spielen kann
193047 aber es gibt keine chance dass ich rechtzeitig gesund werde
193048 ich wollte eigentlich direkt nach peking fliegen aber jetzt lasse ich die sache zun chst in europa von rzten untersuchen
193049 die stuttgarter wollten ihn partout nicht abgeben dabei sind 25 millionen euro plus x ja kein pappenstiel
193050 wenn wir flamini und hleb um jeden preis gewollt h tten w ren beide spieler jetzt bei uns
193051 beides sind wunderbare sympathische offene burschen die sehr gut zum fc bayern passen weil sie sehr popul r sind
193052 aber am ende muss der ball ins tor was bringt mir der liebste schwiegersohn wenn er nicht trifft
193053 er muss die em leistungen aus dem t rkei oder portugalspiel ber einen langen zeitraum zeigen dann wird er hier keine probleme haben
193054 unsere t r war und steht immer offen f r ihn
193055 er hat hier einen guten vertrag ja wo soll er denn hin wohin denn ich glaube nicht dass er in einer kurzschlussreaktion irgendwo irgendeinen vertrag unterschreibt
193056 wir sind berzeugt davon dass wir mit diesem trainer den nichtabstieg vermeiden
193057 es h tte f r uns bei der auslosung sicherlich besser laufen k nnen
193058 atletico madrid ist eine gute mannschaft die in der sehr starken spanischen liga im letzten jahr vierter geworden ist und ber starke spieler verf gt wir m ssen den gegner nun genau beobachten und versuchen uns im heimspiel eine gute ausgangsposition zu verschaffen
193059 schalke ist sicherlich nicht der beste aber auch nicht der schlechteste gegner f r uns trotzdem gehen wir optimistisch in die spiele tatsache ist dass das r ckspiel in madrid ist und das ist ein vorteil f r uns
193060 das ist ein hammer los der schwerstm gliche gegner f r uns das ist eine paarung die man sicher eher f rs achtel oder viertelfinale erwartet aber wir wollen um jeden preis in die gruppenphase und m ssen deshalb auch diesen gegner schlagen
193061 in der qualifikation zur champions league gibt es keine leichten spiele aber wir haben in der letzten saison bewiesen was wir in der k nigsklasse leisten k nnen f r uns ist die partie gegen madrid ein super spiel und auch sicherlich f r unsere fans schon zu beginn der saison ein h hepunkt
193062 today we learned that 51 000 jobs were lost last month the seventh straight month of job loss now totaling 463 00 jobs lost since the beginning of this year
193063 ive already called for an economic stimulus package on two different occasions this year and much of what ive proposed has passed in congress these efforts have made some difference but with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system and a growing credit crunch we need to do more
193064 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
193065 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
193066 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
193067 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
193068 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
193069 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
193070 one of the sanctions you are seeking is that this man be jailed
193071 i would be hard pressed under these circumstances to prevent him from calling evidence
193072 this is an important issue for the future of choice in food
193073 manade f rf dernas andar att f rsvara preah vihear och jaga bort fienden
193074 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
193075 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
193076 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
193077 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
193078 oh man ive been hiring half retarded chimps thats my problem i should hire good people
193079 but we dont know how people get to be better leaders some people just are
193080 last night i was a trillionaire today ill be using coins
193081 he was a great person he was kind thoughtful and he did not deserve this
193082 i feel for his parents and sisters and his little brother
193083 all i can remember is good times with tim there was never one day it wasnt fun or he made you smile or cry because you were laughing so hard he made good memories but hes in all of our hearts and hes not going anywhere
193084 the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
193085 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
193086 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
193087 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
193088 its really doubly special because im standing here on the great wall and watching it
193089 i have a really deep feeling especially because its exactly eight days before the olympics
193090 you just feel part of nature this is so rare
193091 i was born during an eclipse and i have always felt thats made my life more fortunate
193092 but i didnt turn out to have any special genius so i cant say the eclipse left any mark of fate or destiny on me
193093 nous avons deux projets iphone sur lesquels nous travaillons au moins vaguement le premier est une extension de nos trucs sur t l phones portables ndlr il ne sagit pas dorcs amp elves lautre sera un tour de force graphique et il sera tonnamment excitant
193094 la partie multiplayer ne sera pas aussi bonne que celle de quake live mais elle devrait tout de m me tre sympa le but est de faire mieux que le multi de doom 3 ou quake 4
193095 il nest pas encore tout fait impossible que nous d veloppions un nouveau projet sur quake ca d pendra probablement du succ s de quake live mais pour linstant les diteurs ne sont pas int ress s par un jeu focalis uniquement sur le multiplayer et ils ont certainement raison pour les ann es venir quake sera repr sent par quake live
193096 je pense que lann e derni re les gens qui ont assist la quakecon 2007 ont eu le sentiment que rage sera plus un jeu de courses et de combats motoris s quun fps
193097 nous ne savons pas nous m mes quand est ce quil sera achev rage sortira d s quil sera fun et termin
193098 the performances and lecture demonstrations are all geared toward the local community
193099 there arent as many as accidents as you might think
193100 although we cant eliminate the risks entirely we can manage them and minimize them
193101 its a wonderful opportunity to see this art form and participate in it in various ways
193102 i always expect more of myself thats what keeps me going i could have 16 sacks and im still going to be pushing for 20
193103 i wont necessarily say its easy but im just better prepared for this year
193104 im used to the altitude and used to the coaches and used to the way practice is
193105 when i hurt my ankle last year i wasnt ever the same after that
193106 when the weather changed it got worse everything is good now and im ready to go
193107 im a lot stronger at the point of attack and im doing the stuff they brought me here to do
193108 defensive coordinator bob slowik was telling me tuesday you look a whole lot better than last year
193109 it lets me know im going in the right direction
193110 you hear a lot from everyone about the talent in the nfl and its no joke
193111 everybody can play everybody can go everybody is fast everybody is strong thats probably the biggest thing im getting adjusted to you cant take any plays off there are opportunities for you to make plays and those opportunities come few and far between
193112 you want to be confident in your skills but at the same time youre aware of the fact that you cant be overconfident
193113 guys out here at any given moment can make you look like you dont know what youre doing
193114 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
193115 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either
193116 a very valued member of the agricultural economy and the agricultural community here in boulder county
193117 we plan to have the goats out of the farm by the end of september
193118 were doing a search warrant on the suspects house and we have a team doing a search in weld county where we believe the gun was disposed of
193119 theres not 100 000 pieces to it but it seems like it
193120 weve been working on this for close to two days
193121 theres not 100 000 pieces to it but it seems like it
193122 weve been working on this for close to two days
193123 it all seems to come together on the last day
193124 we get one ride finished and another starts rolling in the ferris wheel the star ship the tilt a whirl
193125 every time we get to thinking were finished here comes another one
193126 one of our guys was hit by a car last week one guys brother died and one guys mother died
193127 so were really short on hands weve got 20 men and we could use about twice that
193128 that changes with each type of show the longhorn show has to be totally fenced but that fencing comes down with the beef and dairy events
193129 by taking american grown biomass from trees corn husks and grasses and putting them in our vehicles csu is going toe to toe with opec and tackling our dependence on foreign oil
193130 his family was calling him while they were en route to mexico
193131 were going to move forward with the planning process we just dont feel like we have to be on our racehorses
193132 with that potential liability nobody wanted to invest in the company
193133 we had talked about it and talked about it and finally we told the employees this is probably the way were going to go
193134 then it took a month for the board of directors to pull together a shareholders meeting
193135 the way weve been growing and sales have been expanding we think that by the end of next year were going to be busting at the seams again
193136 participou o coordinador do centro de referencia e servizos de software libre de galiza o pasado 6 de maio en bruxelas en calidade de membro do grupo de expertos do o sitio que a comunidade europea lanzou en 2007 como punto de encontro de iniciativas europeas en materia de e goberno v n de facer p blico o informe dos resultados nos que se recollen as principais conclusi ns como pautas estrat xicas de cara ao establecemento dunha pol tica europea futura forte e consolidada
193137 koenaji you could get a sharper nose if you go in for surgery everyone does it these days
193138 why did you do it did your nose stop you from winning the supermodel contest
193139 she wants to become a model or an actress but she has some baby fat can we do this surgery to make her look perfect
193140 ive heard farah is considering you for her film i dont know you well but im sure you are extremely talented
193141 if you allow a business in you will change the community forever its a small community and this is a big impact
193142 its a setback but were going to keep moving forward
193143 a rod is clearly bringing in enough publicity for them if hell actually study with yardeni yardeni is madonnas direct contact this is a very big deal
193144 when theres trouble with madonna when she needs help with a decision yardeni is dispatched
193145 he calls the shots in her spiritual life when shes on tour and needs spiritual guidance he flies to wherever she is the same will go for a rod
193146 i dont know if hell be allowed in the locker room though
193147 once that guy pulled out a crumpled check for 16 000 and asked me if i thought he could still cash it a year later
193148 we do that in 21 hours so were right up there at the top in terms of sculpture shows nationally
193149 this sounds silly but we also now have a public restroom at benson sculpture park after 25 years
193150 and we really view it as the newest piece of art for the park we believe it is certainly the nicest public restroom in loveland and i think it is the nicest in the state maybe beyond
193151 i bet theres been 17 000 butts in that saddle
193152 heck i cant blame him im not going to say that he cant
193153 ive always been one to follow my gut and follow my heart with decisions and when ive done that things have worked out pretty darn good for me
193154 my gut was telling me that this wasnt the right situation
193155 i still have a great passion for the game of football
193156 i still very much love it in my heart i still feel like i can compete at a pro bowl level but the situation is going to have to be right im not going to just play for any team or any situation
193157 ill be rooting for john as long as hes not in the afc west
193158 if he is ill be rooting for him as a person just not in the games we play
193159 but i understand how competitive he is and how much pride he has about what he does on the field
193160 john will go on and continue to have much success
193161 im sure if he wants to play he can still play at a high level
193162 john came up to me and said mike if the season started today where do you see me
193163 its very difficult for them this premiere is a thing where you show up and meet fans and its all very playful and nice
193164 but when youre just trying to do your daily chores and live your life and people are all over you trying to climb out of cars and windows its not so healthy
193165 in order to survive this you have to have your feet on the ground in some way
193166 family is very helpful its always the best thing if you have good family members and friends that will tell you the truth then youre very fortunate
193167 the stock market prescribers and payers have already reacted to a lot of this
193168 there may be some refining of behavior but not much
193169 we were concerned that the event would have to be canceled actually
193170 we dont have a provision for postponing it or moving it to another location
193171 ayesha and farhan have been dating for nearly three years and are very serious about each other its time to take the relationship to the next and a meaningful level the families have met and discussed the wedding plans
193172 yes i am getting married very very soon i will make a formal announcement of the date and the month shortly
193173 ayesha and i have decided to marry it could be end of this year or early next year i know ayeshas parents very well and my parents too like her a lot
193174 thats not the reason why ayesha is signing fewer films actually she is not getting the kind of work she would enjoy doing
193175 you know how she works we havent yet decided whether we will stay with my parents or not
193176 i want to see where the sirens sing hear how the wolves howl sail the dead calm waters of the pacific i want to find the secret path a bird delivered into my heart it s not the end not the kingdom come it is the journey that matters the distant wanderer call of the wild in me forever and ever and ever forever wanderlust
193177 dark portrayal of a woman on the brink of ruin a very human story about the private margaret behind the public persona as she loses her grip on the power she has strived so hard to achieve
193178 blessed is the man that trusts in the lord and whose hope the lord is
193179 were not just talking about forecasting scattered showers but forecasting that at 2 pm there will be a thunderstorm at such and such a location
193180 one of the biggest issues of a forecast is predicting when will it stop can we keep going with this event until the rain stops
193181 it was a natural extension to carry this on to other parts of society
193182 day by day under labour the rights and liberties of law abiding citizens across reading and indeed the country are being eroded
193183 their plans for id cards and 42 days detention are examples there has been a huge surge in powers of entry under labour entrenching and extending the surveillance state
193184 a catcher and his body are like the outlaw and his horse hes got to ride that nag till it drops
193185 in the end i would go to work early before anyone got there and i would just kill the animals myself because i couldnt stand to let them go through that i must have killed a thousand of them sometimes dozens every day
193186 on my way down into the district i would stop in potomac and pick up triple ground prime meat i would break a raw egg and take onions and capers and i would mix it all and i would go about checking on the animals while eating this raw food right out of my hand
193187 shelters cannot humanely house and support all these animals until their natural deaths they would be forced to live for years lonely and stressed in cramped cages or kennels and other animals would have to be turned away because there would not be room for them turning unwanted animals loose to roam the streets is not a humane option if they dont starve freeze get hit by a car or die of disease they may be tormented and possibly killed by cruel juveniles or picked up by dealers who obtain animals to sell to laboratories
193188 not only unbelievably light and beautifully designed it is also extremely comfortable and very easy to use
193189 smart is dynamic quick and simple a convincing design solution with perfect functionality

193191 me and my mum have asked for police help to get the liaison officer to be able to contact the brazilian embassy to try to get things speeded up
193192 we are going to be taken now to a london police station from there my mum can get her head together and get her thoughts together
193193 my mum had paid for the ticket home and we were looking forward to having her back she was a wonderful sister
193194 there is insufficient evidence and a fatal weakness in the crowns case
193195 i have never seen jill dando in the flesh in any shape or form
193196 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
193197 our test is always whether there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction it would be wholly wrong to only bring cases where we were guaranteed a conviction
193198 at the first appeal the court of appeal considered it to be a sound identification case whilst at the second appeal the court allowed the appeal on a very narrow point concerning the firearms discharge residue which was not used this time but ordered that a retrial should take place
193199 the fact that the trial ran its full course confirms that although it has changed in detail the circumstantial evidence in this case which has been tested over and over again by the courts was judged fit to be put before a jury
193200 we are disappointed by todays verdict but especially disappointed for jills family and friends however we respect the decision of the court
193201 the investigation into her murder was complex thorough and professional with more than 2 500 statements taken and 3 700 exhibits recovered
193202 we would like to thank the members of public who came forward following the murder to give us information in particular those that gave evidence in court
193203 it would not be appropriate to comment any further at this time except to say that we will be reflecting on todays verdict and considering how best to proceed
193204 this result is a clear rejection of an inadequate offer our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
193205 inflation is at 4 6 per cent and key items on household bills like bread and milk are increasing even faster our members need a fair offer from their employers we have a window of opportunity to see if we can avoid disruptive strikes i hope the employers take it
193206 our members have rejected a below inflation pay offer and we could now see industrial action within a matter of weeks unless the scottish employers address the issue of low pay
193207 i believe that our current differences are best resolved through negotiation and we are available for constructive discussion that takes us towards a mutually agreed solution
193208 the scottish government has provided record funding for local government despite an extremely tight financial climate

193210 the association is fortunate in being able to find eight members who are now willing to serve on the management committee they have a difficult task ahead to rebuild the association
193211 if somebody doesnt pay thats not got anything to do with me i have no knowledge of that figure somebody has to pay for the gardening and i have been signing cheques
193212 the last time nobody was prepared to stand for the management committee
193213 theres still a lot of anger but with a brand new committee theres a great enthusiasm for taking things forward

193272 not only has the government denied the existence of slavery and failed to respond to cases brought to its attention it has hampered the activities of organisations which are working on the issue including by refusing to grant them official recognition
193273 it is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of islamic law the quran
193274 the sudanese governments support of slavery and its continued military action which has resulted in numerous deaths are due in part to the victims religious beliefs
193275 in ever increasing numbers and with ever increasing clarity the soldiers of the north came to understand that the cause of the union was the cause of liberty for all men
193276 this story is so complicated and deep that the venal and superficial among us can continue to deny it
193277 our liberty reborn from the civil wars labor remains imperfect as we must expect of any mortal thing pettifogging lawyers and dishonest scholars will always be able to carp selectively and ignorantly about the warts upon our body politic
193278 but the truth of the civil war is that the terrible price for american slavery has been paid once for all by the american peoples deliberate acceptance of their duty to pay it when in gods providence southern intransigence brought it due

193337 but i will concede that in the interests of fairness and for any poor deluded souls that would get a kick out of ticking that box it should be there
193338 i just kind of etched my name on the inside and put the team i was with the year i won it and put in quotations enjoy it
193339 we were allowed to have it for a week or three or four days when i got the cup there was a bolt that was loose on the inside it is very easy to take the bottom off of it and when i took the bottom off i proceeded to fix the loose nut and i noticed some french names that were carved inside they had repaired the cup in the 1940s and that is where i got the idea from
193340 i just etched it in with a screw driver there was nothing malicious or anything like that it was just a little thing i started and hopefully it will continue the bottom is just a little plastic thing that comes off with three or four bolts and i was trying to repair it
193341 i had it right in the middle of my living room floor so there was plenty of light we got it on video tape too
193342 there are only two pieces the bottom and the rest of the cup i wanted to make sure i put it back together
193343 when i got the cup there was a bolt that was loose on the inside it is very easy to take the bottom off of it and when i took the bottom off i proceeded to fix the loose nut and i noticed some french names that were carved inside they had repaired the cup in the 1940s and that is where i got the idea from
193344 we put it in marios pool and it sinks in a matter of 10 seconds we didnt want to hurt it because you got to respect the cup but you want have some fun with it too
193345 i am sure there are more stories than you can fit right now that a lot of guys dont want to talk about
193346 we never abused it we did some fun things with it again marios pool and drinking out of it that is the historic thing to do babies sitting in it dogs eating out of it everybody has done all of that
193347 i got it from penguins executive and one time nfl defensive back paul martha you have maybe hundreds or thousands of people handling it and after a while things are going to come loose inside and when i got it it was like that and i just wanted to fix it
193348 the good thing about moving to portland will be having everyone in the minors on the same program
193349 the last few years have been hard for us to grow our players with the half and half arrangement with the
193350 we havent brought marek up yet for a couple of reasons
193351 when we needed a fourth line guy we brought up clarke macarthur there werent too many offensive call ups marek is a young kid who still could have been playing juniors the year before last
193352 we want to see some growth in his quickness and battling skills and were expecting this year to be a good turnaround season for him he has to be a key guy for us in portland it would be great if he is the first guy called up this season
193353 nathan had a really good camp and he played just like he plays in his college games
193354 you cant help but notice him hes always around the puck creating offense he pulls things out of his hat sometimes and he fit in really well
193355 hes successful because he is quick and there is a ton of battler in him hes a smaller version of brian gionta gionta has that quickness too gerbe has slippery quickness and competes for pucks he doesnt like to lose i find it hard to believe an inch or two will make that much difference if a guy has the heart twice the size of someone else nathan should do all right
193356 ennis is in the gerbe mold a creative offensive player
193357 he played pretty well here at development camp and he handles himself really well he has a composure to him his junior coach spoke highly of him hes kind of small but hell get bigger and stronger hes bigger than gerbe
193358 there will probably be a transition for him to go from defenseman to forward thats our thought process right now
193359 he played forward last season for half the year and ran the power play from the point in the american league hes got the capability of doing that this way we get the offensive mentality of a forward at the point and he has more defensive background than the average forward at the point
193360 his issue is his skating his gift is his big shot
193361 mark is probably going to get another chance to see where he fits in in the nhl there arent too many guys can shoot a puck like him he needs to work on his foot speed especially the first couple of steps
193362 hes not going to be the guy that carries the puck hell be more like a dave andreychuk who goes to the net gets the puck and pounds it into the net mark is a hybrid guy who played defense in juniors and some forward hes a guy who can score and get the puck to the net then somehow they get through the goalie
193363 for a kid that tall he has good feet and hands you dont see that all the time this is a guy who is 6 foot 7 but it so coordinated that he can really motor
193364 hes the complete pro from his work ethic to his desire to be an nhl player he will be there mike is a tough guy to play against and he has a great desire to succeed and achieve
193365 in a way its not surprising because he lives with the ott family in windsor ontario and he has great respect for dallas forward steve ott and steves dad he also had a lot of respect for his junior coaches in windsor when we drafted him we were told he has a burning desire to play in the nhl and we have seen nothing to make us disagree with that statement
193366 hes an offensive defenseman who flew onto the charts this year
193367 he has to become like a lot of kids going from juniors to the professional game he thinks offense but you have to be capable defensively hopefully his skating agility and his defensive awareness will improve he needs to work on his pivoting his turning to skate backwards his first couple of steps anyone can skate a straight line todays game is about wiggling around making tight turns skating in a phone booth you have to be able to maneuver get a little space and throw a puck on net
193368 chris is another guy that is going to play in the nhl
193369 we expect great things he has speed power and awareness chris thinks like a defenseman and he has a good skill set hes a lot like his former denver university teammate matt carle hes in great shape hes a great physical fitness guy with very little body fat at 198 pounds
193370 this is his third development camp with us and he has always been very athletic his quickness and power rank at the top of our list we cant ask for much more than that
193371 mike has to get stronger and he has to work on his mobility
193372 mike has a long reach long arms and a long stick he needs to learn how to tangle guys up without getting penalties like a lot of young guys he has to learn the percentages when to make a certain play at a certain time
193373 dennis is a good skater and passer but hes another guy who has to get stronger to play in the nhl
193374 although he was used as power play guy in juniors we look at him not as guy who runs it but as the defenseman on the other side from the power play quarterback he has a big shot a really good one timer hes not the guy who deceives and moves the puck but hes good as the other point on the power play because he has defensive and offensive skills
193375 jhonas signed a three year entry level contract with us in may and we are expecting him to be with our ahl team in portland this year
193376 jhonas is a technique goaltender versus a blocker type hes smaller sized but his numbers and experiences at his age are equal to a henrik lundqvist jhonas has achieved what lundqvist did at his age and they have very similar numbers that would be great if he is comparable to lundqvist
193377 he doesnt get rattled i saw him in sweden in pressure games and he handles things with ease it seems he has that poise and composure that you want in your goalie and he is mature beyond his years thats another good trait for a goaltender a lot of them dont play that well until they are 30
193378 this is such a mentally tough game that a lot of young goalies are not ready for it
193379 a cave large enough to accommodate a very large congregation of people
193380 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating

193387 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
193388 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
193389 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
193390 it is not going to be a retirees board the benefit of having icahn on the board is the status quo is broken it is going to be under an awful lot pressure to act
193391 some of the bigger shareholders want to push for a new ceo
193392 there is a small possibility that shareholder disappointment results in jerry yang being moved aside in a sort of bloodless coup

193399 ruminant animals chewing a cud such as cows and sheep produce methane as a result of the digestive process dairy cows are particularly important sources of methane because of the volume of food both grass and processed material that they eat
193400 the methane that cattle and their manure produce has a global warming effect equal to that of 33 million automobiles
193401 if all the grain currently fed to livestock in the u s was consumed directly by people the number who could be fed is nearly 800 million
193402 implement a new system to deal with farm waste to replace the inflexible and broken system that exists today to protect americans from the adverse environmental and human health hazards of improperly handled ifap waste
193403 intensification of agricultural production on some of the better lands for example by increased fertilizer benefits
193404 2 000 pounds of grain must be supplied to livestock in order to produce enough meat and other livestock products to support a person for a year whereas 400 pounds of grain eaten directly will support a person for a year
193405 people who eat meat and animal products are in denial about anything and everything having to do with animal farming
193406 they know that it must be bad but they dont want to look at any part of it so all of it stays hidden and abuses flourish whether of animals workers or the environment
193407 food choices are a very personal decision for most people and we are only now convincing them that this is a tool at their disposal if they care about the environment
193408 people have a very visceral reaction when told they shouldnt be eating the core meats they grew up with
193409 the nutritionists say were eating way too much meat for our health
193410 the public knows this but it doesnt change their dietary habits what will alter their behavior is higher prices for meat and milk which are inevitable because of higher fuel prices and the rising cost of corn caused in part by the diversion of corn crops to making ethanol
193411 right now we have some of the lowest food prices in the world
193412 in the u s we pay 15 percent of our budgets for food compared to 30 percent in europe and 60 percent in indonesia
193413 the government should be sponsoring major mass media campaigns to convince people to eat more fruit vegetables and whole grains
193414 from an environmental point of view the less beef people eat the better
193415 there are the environmental and animal welfare problems caused by modern agriculture
193416 the animals retribution is that we die of heart disease and cancer
193417 has an important role to play in nutrient recycling minerals are taken up by growing plants and when those plants are eaten by grazers some of it ends up in their tissues and some is returned to the soil in their waste products but whats good in small quantities becomes toxic and devastating in large amounts so it is only beneficial if we were raising livestock in much smaller numbers than we are today
193418 the human gastrointestinal tract features the anatomical modifications consistent with an herbivorous diet
193419 from a sustainability point of view whats really needed is for people to understand the connections between factory farming meat eating and environmental impacts
193420 the figures on methane production speak for themselves but when it comes to doing whats right for the environment most people dont take big steps they just do the best they can

193475 i dont want the campaign at this stage to degenerate into so much tit for tat back and forth that we lose sight of why all of us are doing this weve got too much at stake at this time in our history to be engaging in this kind of silliness
193476 the choice is clear most of all we can choose between hope and fear it is going to be very difficult for republicans to run on their stewardship of the economy or their outstanding foreign policy we know what kind of campaign theyre going to run theyre going to try to make you afraid theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
193477 anne armstrong was one of texas admired and influential women as the first female to serve as counselor to the president she broke barriers for women and ascended the political ladder in a traditionally male dominated arena she stood for core values like freedom opportunity and family whether as a mother a wife a rancher or a politician anne armstrongs commitment and dedication was unmatched this is a fitting tribute to her and im pleased to honor and commemorate her incredible service to texas and the nation as a whole
193478 anne armstrong has been a close trusted friend and my greatest mentor for over 30 years i met anne in 1971 when i interviewed her while working as a reporter for a texas television station shortly after i began as her press secretary in washington when she was the first woman to serve as co chair of the republican national committee since that time i have not made a major decision in my career without first consulting anne annes contributions to this country as a diplomat public servant counselor and friend to five presidents rightly earned her the presidential medal of freedom annes friends valued her passion energy work ethic and loyalty women have benefited from the barriers she overcame in government diplomacy and politics throughout her career the armstrong family is synonymous with kenedy county and south texas has lost a familiar community leader my heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the armstrong family and friends

193691 i have a contract with renault for the long term but of course at the end of every season you need to look at what the possibilities are it is not the time now in the middle of august to think but for sure in september and october i will have a think and we will decide

193697 these models are the basis on which all research on climate change is done
193698 they are used to make policies and come up with mitigation strategies
193699 we basically got opposite answers when we should have gotten the same answer
193700 this shows that the work being done around predicting the biological impacts of climate change can vary depending on which particular climate model is being used its concerning because a vast majority of the impact research conducted is based on the projections of these models
193701 we ought to be extremely cautious about research results particularly if the findings are based on only one model projection before running off and making policies
193702 the findings cant be considered likely unless they are run through many models

193713 our experience from previous years is that there are still a number of employers who do not fully appreciate the legal requirements when it comes to employing young people
193714 for example they need to arrange work permits for their young employees and to have proper insurance cover for them
193715 equally many people dont seem to realise that children and young people have to have a performance license if they are appearing in a public entertainment

193768 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
193769 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
193770 the scientific community is really going to run with this

193786 a map would show that these collection programs and human networks were in place in such numbers to nearly cover afghanistan

193790 us rangers were also training special troops in kyrgyzstan 53
193791 i think there was some discussion of the fact that the united states was so disgusted with the taliban that they might be considering some military action
193792 it was doubtful that washington would drop its plan even if bin laden were to be surrendered immediately by the taliban
193793 its possible that a mischievous american participant after several drinks may have thought it smart to evoke gold carpets and carpet bombs even americans cant resist the temptation to be mischievous

193799 the attitude of the american public toward the external projection of american power has been much more ambivalent the public supported americas engagement in world war ii largely because of the shock effect of the japanese attack on pearl harbor

193856 its close proximity will also provide us great convenience and flexibility

193877 football time is here its an exciting time for these guys
193878 but two a days are sometimes overwhelming for the kids and staff because there is so much to do
193879 they put a lot of work in the weight room and they are fired up and ready to get started
193880 its great to see them doing the things we expect of them at the first practice
193881 its just a lot of change of pace from being in the weight room picking things up again
193882 but once we get flowing we feel no one can stop us
193883 two a days are awesome i think me and the other linemen were ready to hit already and its just the first practice
193884 our guys are antsy to do more than just shove at the pads
193885 and the seniors are ready for their last year but the challenge for this group will be to take it to the next level
193886 and with queen all inter valley conference first teamer zach queen in the backfield that gives us someone who can run and block
193887 we have really high expectations because as coach says it was last years seniors who got us to the playoffs it was their success we havent won anything so its our turn to step it up we have to work for everything we get
193888 it feels good to get started and its time to make the off season work payoff
193889 it gets us ready for the first game of the season because you know its going to be hot
193890 we know whats expected of us weve just got to suck it up and come out and work everyday
193891 but we know there is a lot of work to do theres always hope and confidence among the kids at the start of the season and well just have to see what they do with it
193892 it feels good starting out getting out on the field
193893 weve got a lot of younger guys and everythings got to come quick
193894 flying around to the ball watching them at game speed
193895 we had two weeks of camp like all the high schools where we introduced our offense and defense and now this is where we get the fundamentals
193896 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
193897 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
193898 i couldnt quite believe it that i had found this species which isnt supposed to occur here in scotland and that it was living right here under our noses
193899 it is likely that there are many more undiscovered species right under our noses
193900 despite the fact that the mushroom season is just a few weeks old and i have not yet had time to go looking properly these are exciting finds
193901 the main reason for my amazing finds is that there are so few people in the uk with the necessary identification skills to be able to spot these species there are hardly any professional mycologists with the necessary skills left in the uk unlike many other european countries put simply we just dont know what or how many species of fungi we have here
193902 it is also true that some of these species may have recently arrived here from abroad as accidental introductions on imported trees or they have spread as a result of climate change
193903 it is very likely that if we look hard enough we will find many more new and previously unrecorded species of fungi right here on our doorstep
193904 this is a great shame but it does highlight the urgent need for detailed surveying of our fungal biodiversity so that we can give protection to rare and important species
193905 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
193906 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone
193907 those of us interested in pulmonary rehabilitation are happy to see confirmation of the beneficial effects of exercise training this information indicates that creatine supplementation not be viewed as a good substitute for exercise training good news for adepts of pulmonary rehabilitation
193908 without minimizing the importance of the quest to optimize the results of pulmonary rehabilitation we had to appreciate that only a small portion of patients with copd actually engage in pulmonary rehabilitation so improved access is important for pr to achieve its full potential from a public health perspective
193909 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
193910 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
193911 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
193912 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
193913 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
193914 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk
193915 this has benefited 289 937 households and about 1 4 million individuals across the country
193916 we have to note that these outstanding claims are difficult to settle as a result of the nature of the challenges that affects the claims such as opposition from some of the land owners who are disputing the validity of the claims exorbitant land prices claims that have been referred to the land claims court family disputes as well as boundary disputes involving traditional leaders
193917 the dual role of investigating and settling claims on the one hand and providing development support on the other hand coupled with the nature of challenges that we have encountered along the way has had a negative impact on the commissions ability to finalise the settlement of restitution claims within the timeframe earmarked initially for that purpose
193918 muitas pessoas buscam novas possibilidades de tratamento pelas dificuldades de conseguir um atendimento pela medicina convencional ou por estar insatisfeito pela maneira como caminham os cuidados com sua sa de ou simplesmente por acreditar que as pr ticas complementares podem trazer melhor qualidade de vida para o que j recebem dentro do tratamento convencional

194061 this general picture of star formation and the ability to compare how stellar objects form in different time periods and regions of the universe will eventually allow investigation in the origins of life and planets

194138 we are fighting a war whose very source is based outside of afghanistan inside of pakistan as long as the taleban has a base we wont be able to win this war
194139 from traffic jams to corruption to a lack of electricity its a failure that needs to be fixed before it is too late
194140 i think force generation as we call it bringing the forces together for afghanistan is a nato responsibility
194141 im concerned because i think this is obscuring the good things happening in afghanistan and the success the mission is having
194142 the church of rome is fearful that it could lose more priests like us
194143 and it should be afraid given its level of scandal over internal abuses and hypocrisy in combating poverty
194144 we are committed to help make health insurance more affordable
194145 the question on my mind is how much of this billion dollars that youre going to save over the six years is going to go into reserves and how much is going to go to reduce premiums
194146 i think if you talk about reduced premiums you have a much more attractive proposition
194147 we are constantly battling against increases of wealth theres a very fundamental problem here that no one really wants to talk about
194148 there is no way the government can hope to achieve any of its emissions targets without cheating unless it changes its policies on encouraging flying and hoping to satisfy peoples insatiable demands for buying more and more stuff
194149 strategic plan to set out very clearly how the uk will become a low carbon economy by 2050 at the moment there is no central priority for environmental issues consumers consumption of goods is the driver of emissions the continued pursuit of gdp of economic growth that is a mantra that we must question
194150 thats going to mean a very large cut 80 90 per cent in emissions within 40 years we need to increase energy efficiency sure but it wont do to just put in a few energy saving light bulbs we need to think bigger
194151 its about a quantity lifestyle more and more stuff versus quality
194152 the idea of a technological fix is one we should be cautious about
194153 so often there are unintended consequences or trade offs look at the paperless office theres now more paper not less look at biofuels id be wary of believing that a technology solution will arrive in time
194154 we need to find ways of living that address the problem

194157 next summer we should go to a game in milwaukee
194158 hey the brewers just traded cc and sheets for santo edmunds rocks
194159 sorry for the delay in my response to your last message i was distracted by the grand slam
194160 the cubs never did anything for me when i lived there
194161 karen this will be great the cubs will win the division the brewers will win the wild card and then the cubs will win the world series everybodys happy
194162 with the addition of the ogo it is the perfect combination of extreme sports for the whole family
194163 next summer we should go to a game in milwaukee
194164 hey the brewers just traded cc and sheets for santo edmunds rocks
194165 sorry for the delay in my response to your last message i was distracted by the grand slam
194166 the cubs never did anything for me when i lived there
194167 karen this will be great the cubs will win the division the brewers will win the wild card and then the cubs will win the world series everybodys happy
194168 manny ramirez was striking out while not trying jason bay strikes out while trying
194169 but he rosberg had some bad races like monaco and montreal where he should have scored points but for me its pretty cool to be even with my team mate because in the end thats what counts
194170 for a rookie this is quite satisfying and i must say it gives me a rush of self confidence
194171 of course i am quite satisfied with my result and the season so far
194172 that i could score points four times is honestly more than i expected
194173 i thought it would be very tough to come across points
194174 actually it is very tough but i think i was able to find the right time sometimes
194175 at tracks like monaco and montreal where you have less grip or where you have softer tyres like at this track here in these situations we have been quite good so this gives me hope for sundays race
194176 well the track in jerez is quite different to this one but we did some set up tests and the next few days will show if we have tested successfully
194177 as we are convinced that this could be our track finishing in the points is the objective
194178 despite this progress and strong growth in international geographies slowing performance in the u s impacted top line revenue growth looking forward we remain confident in open source innovation as the accelerant to our growth strategy through increased adoption of our open source offerings
194179 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
194180 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
194181 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
194182 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo
194183 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
194184 while we still disagree on many points i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
194185 i am as excited as i have ever been to lead this company
194186 ive been married for 32 years and never cheated on her because im addicted to her
194187 as it stands now john will be on the red carpet with her and dont be at all surprised to see jennifer sporting an engagement ring by then these two are serious
194188 jennifer continues to be more public in her relationship with john than she has with anybody ever
194189 i most definitely want kids but ill probably adopt i dont know if i can take the kind of pain women go through with childbirth
194190 maybe in the year 2020 you could just pop a baby out and itd be fine but right now id rather just adopt
194191 i spoke to shia in the hospital his two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
194192 the kid really has his head together and you know hes only 22 hes doing a great job on this movie he has really matured since the last one and i love working with him
194193 you know she wasnt the kind that played with dolls and then all of the sudden she has all of these children
194194 the twins are healthy and theyre doing well and im so happy
194195 its really doubly special because im standing here on the great wall and watching it
194196 i have a really deep feeling especially because its exactly eight days before the olympics
194197 you just feel part of nature this is so rare
194198 am i wrong to say the papers have said he beats up women you dont change people for people who have no record for people who whether they say theyve changed or not have a history of beating up women
194199 you dont change someone who has fine character has done a good job and youve known as i said for at least 35 years for someone who has no record of achievement and has demonstrated a bad habit
194200 i have nothing to hide nothing my life is an open book a testimony of the possibilities of personal growth and redemption and change if one is willing to do the hard work
194201 so once again for the record yes between the years of 1987 and 1991 i did have a pattern of violence against women and it took me even longer to control my temper and aggression toward other males
194202 but thanks to years of therapy spiritual development and personal evolution and the support and encouragement of women like bell hooks susan taylor pearl cleage dr johnetta cole and gloria steinem i have moved beyond that destructive behavior to become a pro feminist anti sexist man committed to gender equality and nonviolent conflict resolution
194203 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
194204 when we are able to give out any pertinent information we will certainly let the public and the media know

194206 however i am encouraged about several developments which will play an important role in our future turnaround
194207 waterford plans to raise about 120 million by selling shares this year and said its major shareholders plan to subscribe for an amount broadly equal to their pro rata entitlements
194208 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board
194209 there is still a lot of anger and frustration among shareholders right now
194210 we believe the board is independent and focused on value creation for long term shareholders
194211 i havent spoken to anyone who thinks hey this is the right team to lead yahoo

194222 i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
194223 a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
194224 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory we face a clash of arms a war of ideas and an assistance effort that will require patience and innovation
194225 you know as you know ive talked about the need to have the full range of national power and international power brought to bear in dealing with these problems
194226 not likely we have nothing of value thats our problem
194227 for all the posturing by manny ramirez and all the speculation about a three team deal that would have sent him to the florida marlins hes still a member of the boston red sox and figures to finish the season with them frankly its fair to wonder how real the manny stuff was he pops off every year about being traded and nothing ever comes of it
194228 it is an ugly thing here going on but theres no way i can imagine the green bay packers being able to force brett favres hand in march when we cant do it here in july and its just the reality of it they asked him no matter how they asked him or how hard they asked him they have done it for years brett we need a decision by march this or march that brett had the right to say this decision is huge for me and im sorry im not ready to make this decision the worst thing i hate out of all of it is brett saying he wants to go to minnesota or chicago because it seems like a spiteful move these are two teams i know you will play against every year and i want to come back and hurt you guys now i dont say he should have any loyalty to front office because that battle will ensue always between player and front office because we are talking about money but certainly certainly to the fans of green bay they deserve something besides you going to minnesota or chicago and coming back saying i will eat you up in your attempt to eat up ted thompson you will eat up the fans that who have supported you so long and loyalty should lie there no doubt to me its bretts fault
194229 we didnt have one of those situations where we had several conversations marching toward a conclusion
194230 i hold out hope to the extent that it would be something that makes sense for us
194231 it a roberts deal was not something that intrigued us unless we got something we really wanted with brian roberts that was a very high bar to clear
194232 we just didnt find an intersection of self interest between ourselves and another club you have to discipline yourself so you dont come out with something just to say you made a trade you have to make sure you come out better than you were before
194233 he didnt mean to hit him because it would make no sense to let them back in the game
194234 its my country and ill lie if i want to
194235 general manager ozzie newsome and director of pro personnel george kokinis are working hard but you ve got to find the right guy in the right circumstances to bring him in john would ve been a good fit for us but it wasn t a good fit for him

194244 provided advice concerning allegations of misconduct directed at president sassou nguesso by creditors of the republic of congo
194245 say the thousands of pages of documents they have compiled reveal hidden identities multiple sham traders for every deal and the son of president sassou nguesso overseeing most of the sales as a private businessman the transactions were designed to loot the congolese national economy according to a lawsuit filed by kensington in new york this past may

194250 you select one of the 47 letters in the collection of love letters fill in a few simple blanks and presto youve got that perfect love letter ready to go it is just that easy
194251 i love you because you know how to make me laugh at the end of a hard day
194252 i love your sleepy look before your first cup of coffee

194272 the road after sexual assault is a long and challenging one as is typical of violent crime i suffer from ptsd violent nightmares and depression i still wake in the night he still comes after me in my dreams because of the impending courts martial i was advised not to talk openly about the case which caused rumors and misconceptions to run rampant there was no escaping it and no making it better the hostility grew with my silence ultimately our society still publicly and privately tries the victims in sexual assault cases rape is the only crime where the victim has to prove their innocence

194303 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
194304 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
194305 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
194306 i passed the medical board and my license to fight was obtained without any problems but the fact is that in california the commission is very rigid for admittance one of the main conditions to let you fight is the ability to pass all of your tests on time i had to be in america by july 13 the visa was only good until the fourteenth and my tickets were purchased in advance for the fifteenth on the whole i was late they thought the organizers could agree and settle the problem but they quickly found out they would not be able to get me on the card instead they were able to find a suitable replacement for paul buentello the laws in california are so rigid
194307 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
194308 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
194309 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
194310 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public
194311 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
194312 the media are now able to access sites to do their job

194315 wir appellieren an das internationale olympische komitee und vor allem an die verantwortlichen auf chinesischer seite eine unbehinderte berichterstattung zu garantieren
194316 wenn jetzt die arbeit unserer eigenen korrespondenten am austragungsort der olympischen spiele eingeschr nkt wird dann ist dies eine neue dimension von zensur gegen die wir uns mit unseren mitteln zur wehr setzen m ssen
194317 officials from the state general administration of sport once told us that if liu cannot win another gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements will become meaningless
194318 i think the high rank officials like pm and president are very good but the lower local officials are completely corrupted
194319 my friend is from sichuan she knows lots of people outside of beijing who were compensated well and even to the extent that people say they are over compensated there shouldnt be violent evictions and local governments are to blame lets hope the central government can get rid of these guys
194320 there are many officials in central government who are willing to solve the tibetan problem but few local officials always put hindrances on the path for their benefit
194321 i think this is more to do with the disgusting attitudes of corrupt local officials rather than the current laws within china the illegal and corrupt actions of a few cannot be viewed as the actions of the majority this is one of the problems with china the central government cant be every where at the same time and when the central governments attentions are away then sometimes people use more power than they actually have
194322 fortunately for beijing farmers tended to blame the local leadership clinging to the traditional view that if the emperor in the capital were properly informed of their plight he would wield a magic wand to help them
194323 past horrors and mistakes do not seem to have weakened a servile belief in the ultimate benevolence of the state and a willingness to grant it unlimited powers
194324 but we have got the tickets and i am very excited about it since this is the olympics it is a very precious moment for us i am very happy
194325 i was so close to the ticket booth area about 20 metres away and the accident happened i was taken by police just because i shouted one word they beat me up and forced me to confess but i didnt do it they didnt allow me chance to explain and hit me i was hurt all over my body and i bled
194326 i wanted to watch the diving very much well probably get the olympics here just once every hundred years if i could just watch the games id feel my life wasnt wasted but i missed that opportunity today
194327 no kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites venues or other areas
194328 sorry you said that there would be dedicated places for protests which park will that be
194329 one in fengtai district shijie park and one in the haidian district the zizhuyuan park and ritan park in the chaoyang district they are all close to the city proper and the olympic venues
194330 exactly one week to go before the games begin so its prediction time ive come up with four questions which
194331 thats it im off on my hols rarely have i gone away so uncertain what the next few months will

194334 ive got extremely fond memories of racing in japan and suzuka is one of my favourite circuits

194337 im not going to think about what other people think about me all im going to think about is how im going to shoot a better score tomorrow and how im going to shoot a low number and i think a low number will take care of everything
194338 we just want to ask him in a message of love and peace to give a strong signal towards the protection of animals and the environment through a small but very significant personal sacrifice

194357 theres something happening on this project 24 hours a day seven days a week
194358 people are really excited about whats rising from the ashes and theres a general feeling that this project has not only been done quickly its been done right
194359 the bridge collapse remains to me a symbol of a state and nation that hasnt paid sufficient attention to its infrastructure

194429 although the risk management program seems to have picked them up quickly which is good the impact on neurologist take up puts our forecasts at serious risk
194430 why do you go to the priest for confession when you can confess directly to god
194431 the greatest good you can do for another is not just share your riches but reveal to them their own
194432 in the life of the spirit there is no ending that is not a beginning
194433 as the certain defense which the mother must use to protect her children from the wiles of this world from the fallen ones who seek also to use the law to their unjust purposes
194434 as i was embodied in a large family of many brothers and sisters of great talent i saw how each one in pursuing his career needed love and ministration and the keeping of the flame of the sacred fire in order to be successful
194435 and thus although the choice was given to me to pursue my own career unbeknownst to my brothers and sisters i quietly kept the flame in deep meditation and prayer as well as outer helpfulness in by way of contacting the great spheres causal body of their divine plan and in accelerating through the mighty archangels chamuel and charity in the understanding that the adversaries of love are many and that love is the full power of creativity and that the success of the career son or daughter of god depends upon the defeat of loves adversary point counterpoint
194436 and therefore in the course of defending the christhood of my brothers and sisters i had to advance in my own self mastery to confront the fallen ones who attempted to thwart them in their most magnificent lifestreams and their offering to the world
194437 i can assure you that at the conclusion of my incarnation when i saw the victory of each one of my brothers and sisters the fullness of my joy was in a heart of love expanded keeping the flame keeping the flame and knowing that i was needed that i was essential to their victory
194438 it seemed to the world and perhaps even to my own that i had not accomplished much but i took my leave into the higher octaves thoroughly understanding the meaning of the self mastery of the pink flame thus it was from the point of the third ray that i entered into the heart of christ and saw the application on the sixth ray as ministration and service
194439 understand this formula of selflessness to know when you have become selfless is to not be aware of the choice of selflessness
194440 but once you have reached that center you are no longer aware of choosing between the self the real self and the not self
194441 your preference is then in supplying the tenderness and compassion perceiving the need because your sensitivity to god has been refined not only by the all seeing eye but by the exercise of the secret rays letting those rays flow through you and fearing not the pain of the crucifixion but altogether transforming that pain into the bliss of communion
194442 he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water
194443 as nada directs disciples in the application of the radiant purple and gold flame of the sixth ray a key step in the nine steps of precipitation taught by the master alchemist saint germain and the priesthood of the order of melchizedek as well as by the seven mighty elohim and the elemental builders of form she stresses the path of devotion bhakti yoga through the reestablishment of a personal heart tie to jesus
194444 god in man is yours to commend into the arms of the holy spirit thus i commend you each one will you commend one another into the arms of the holy spirit and understand that that holy spirit is the immaculate image of father mother god
194445 and when you commend yourself ere you fall asleep at night ere you walk the pathway and the ways of the world when you commend one another into the arms of the holy spirit you are sealing each one in that certain matrix of perfection that is a shield and a guard through all testing through all trial through all tribulation
194446 thus did the lord christ proclaim upon the cross into thy hands i commend my spirit o god thus you see he sealed his soul in the perfection and the protection of the holy spirit this you must do each day for the selfhood of each one entrusted to your care for all mankind for the planetary body for elementals and each blossom rare that my angels now place within the crystal chalice of your hearts
194447 the vortex of every endeavor must contain an intense will
194448 therefore in business in service in any activity consider how far will the light travel how far will the effort expended reach will all the earth be blessed because i have lived this hour and striven for the highest or will only those in my immediate circle find temporal comfort
194449 it is so true beloved hearts that mastery as a quality of itself has many dimensions
194450 thus neither the soul nor the goal itself can rise any higher than its own matrix rather than pursuing many little endeavors concentrate then on that which will reach the star of your i am presence let your christ self calculate the mathematical formula how much effort and planning how much involvement will it take for the rocket of the soul to mount and accelerate to the vibration of the i am presence
194451 you are able to care for and for whom you may adequately express your love
194452 i remember many years ago when a little girl who did not even know of the existence of the masters of wisdom prayed to god and said o father if thou hast any servant upon this earth or anywhere in the universe that will love me and help me thou dost not need to come thyself but send them and i will receive them as thyself
194453 do you understand the sweetness and simplicity of the child mind
194454 and so eventually she found two spiritual friends who guided her destiny and assisted her through the entire school system upon her graduation she became an artist of most ethereal pictures and followed the course of art all the days of her life
194455 i want you to understand that within that artist there were many beautiful pictures unborn paintings that never graced the canvases of the world and if these could have been seen by humanity they would i tell you have paid all that they had just to prize one of them
194456 the love that must be instilled beginning with yourself is a love so tangible for god in the person of one another for god in the person of his saints his angels the masters nature and the simplicity of life itself that in the presence of such love the abrogation of the laws of god is altogether unthinkable
194457 i come in the person of the mother flame as chohan and member of the karmic board to teach you and to walk with you
194458 whenever there is the action of going forth two by two one is the bearer of the alpha flame and the other of the omega forming a circle of light to be penetrated like an impregnable fortress
194459 realize then that the conferring by the lords of karma of opportunity and initiation for twin flames is to that end that the twin flames together might enter the path of initiation of the ruby ray thus with or without companion known or unknown to you it is well to call upon the lords of flame holy kumaras for those initiaations to be given to yourself and your beloved
194460 a truly rich man is one whos children run into his arms when his hands are empty
194461 the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy
194462 of two sisters one is always the watcher one the dancer
194463 family faces are magic mirrors looking at the people who belong to us we see the past the present and the future

194573 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly
194574 in the area by the door there are those pecan bars did your guy count it
194575 no theyre not part of the bakery i didnt place an area tag there so he probably didnt count it
194576 insiders are not holding their breath for any measurable increase this year
194577 therefore notwithstanding the lack of a so called measurable increase the price is still going up again

194592 ik geloof absoluut niet in astrologie het is niet aan mij besteed zolang mensen het als tijdsverdrijf zien is het niet erg maar als mensen er geld aan uitgeven om wazige voorspellingen te horen over hun toekomst en er ook nog beslissingen laten van afhangen uit elkaar gaan ander werk zoeken ben ik de eerste om astrologie te bestrijden ik geloof er namelijk niks van

194608 we hit a total of 644 shots and only lost two balls we had covered over 21000 yards and it had taken 18 hours some people asked us at the end if this had ever been done before but we said nobody is that stupid
194609 throughout the day the generosity of the shetland and orkney people was unbelievable we had individuals coming up to us on the ferry from whalsay on the golf courses at the airports and later in the club houses handing us envelopes with money and messages of support
194610 having been through all that treatment we didnt want to be apart clan is wonderful for individuals and adults and has tremendous opportunity for alternative therapy but they werent geared up for five young children we were trying to keep the kids quiet because there were some very ill people there although some people appreciated the kids lightening things up
194611 we are absolutely delighted about the new facility it will give more of an option for families to stay together
194612 everybody there is in the same position you are not alone in a terrible situation if you were sitting in a hotel you would be isolated
194613 there were a lot of shetlanders there and we made friendships at a time when it was difficult being away from the family
194614 what a boon it was after sitting in intensive care all night to go back to clan you felt like you were going home
194615 i wasnt a depressing place everybody is that cheery everybodys got the same fear as you and theyre coping with it
194616 they seem to have an innate sense of whats appropriate they greet with you and they party with you
194617 many of the more damaging incidents in recent years of smaller slide type peat landslides appear to be associated with extreme rainfall however defined following dry weather i e heavy rain falling on peat that has dried and consequently cracked the surface
194618 current climate change scenarios for the uk in general show a warmer drier summers and b more frequent occurrences of extreme rainfall events at any time of year
194619 unfortunately it is very difficult to predict the pattern of landslides where they will occur or when
194620 this would need a detailed understanding of ground conditions and long term patterns of weather our understanding of these is improving but the natural systems we are dealing with are complicated and require further research
194621 may only be obtained from investigations of the many more such failures that may be predicted to occur in future years
194622 we also did some drainage works at that time to provide positive drainage for water rather than having it building up under the peat and perhaps triggering a landslide in practice landslides are associated with such extreme rainfall that its not something thats terribly predictable
194623 we did identify an area above the dale golf course at the lerwick side of the valley that was causing us a bit of concern and in agreement with the landowner we did some drainage ditches in a field there weve tried to be aware and keep an eye on things
194624 we welcome the sentences which send a strong message that we are going to continue our efforts to disrupt the drugs supply to shetland it is obvious that these men played a significant part in supplying heroin to shetland
194625 we are going to continue to work with our partner agencies to reduce the availability of drugs here and would appeal for the continued help of the public who can either contact us at lerwick police station or crimestoppers

194631 but while i can stick a pirated clip from youtube on my web site with two clicks theres usually no simple straightforward way to do the same thing from a legitimate site
194632 measures to promote regeneration or provide leisure services do not always constitute state aid ec communications and case law recognise this and can offer scope for public authorities to intervene directly in development of premises we understand that there will be no operational subsidy to the caf bar facilities
194633 not least so that the majority of councillors and the majority of the public whom we represent may publicly congratulate them
194634 in the interests of clarity and perspective it should be noted that if the nature of the complaints received are regard ing the caf bar area within mareel then these complaints refer to less than nine per cent of the floor area of the building this represents less than an estimated eight per cent of the project costs given the caf bar is a relatively cheap area to equip compared to the high tech music hall recording studio and cinema spaces
194635 in the unlikely event of a state aid complaint being upheld funds that may be requested to be returned only relate to the proportion of state funds that contribute to that eight per cent of the building costs
194636 many grounds under which mareel could fall foul of state aid
194637 if you think the local licensed trade have been voicing concerns for two maybe three years not to have investigated at least whether the business plan met uk let alone eu competition law is a massive oversight on behalf of shetland arts
194638 if this comes to the development committee and hasnt been resolved can we approve something that might be ultra vires outwith the law i wouldnt like to be doing something that turns out to be unlawful in some way or another
194639 mareel is not a wonderful project and its by no means a done deal
194640 this basic appraisal of the options wasnt done properly and that has caused much of the trouble and confusion
194641 we are sorry that he and a minority of eight of our 21 other colleagues voted in june to ignore financial reality we deplored the conveners comment in that debate to the effect that business plans didnt mean much anyway
194642 i just have no interest in that aspect of it at all
194643 as far as im concerned the building is going ahead i took a stand when the matter was discussed and the result was as it was thats the way democracy works in this country if people are not happy then so be it
194644 if they are so easily led then thats a pity but i think most councillors are strong enough to see that once youve made a decision then youve got to stick with it
194645 its a myth that i said there should be another vote on it thats something that ive never said
194646 we are obviously very pleased this puts the project on a world stage its tremendous
194647 to expand and protect settlement activity and the relatively unhindered movement of settlers and other israelis in and out of the west bank
194648 intimately linked to maintaining settler access and quality of life

194650 the age long dream realised the ancient promise redeemed the promise that even amidst suffering you will find your way home to the fields and shorelines where your ancestors walked
194651 an unbreakable partnership based on shared values of liberty democracy and justice
194652 was not based on security considerations but to 3 it is difficult to see how brown can reconcile this clear rejection of a two state settlement with his praise for the israeli governments
194653 the impacts of the aid boycott in 2006 and 2007
194654 increased donor assistance while welcome will not be sufficient to turn around the economic downturn which has pervaded the palestinian economy since 2000 without significant and long term removal of such restrictions
194655 possibly the most rigorous form of international sanctions imposed in modern times
194656 compel hamas to change its ideological stance or to bring about regime change
194657 attempted coup against the elected hamas government was a principal cause of the internecine palestinian violence that ultimately led to the forcible takeover of gaza by hamas in june 2007 in what the international institute for strategic studies describes as
194658 imperative of palestinian national reconciliation remains as urgent as ever
194659 the decision not to speak to hamas in 2007 following the mecca agreement has been counterproductive
194660 urgently consider ways of engaging politically with moderate elements within hamas
194661 a negotiated settlement with hamas with a view to re establishing a national unity government
194662 it remains important to bring hamas into dialogue and into the peace process
194663 without some kind of reconciliation between hamas and fatah and without international engagement of all stakeholders the peace process will not succeed
194664 life is a daily struggle even to get enough to eat
194665 t he proportion of deaths among hospitalised neonates at gazas pediatric hospitals increased from 5 6 during the period january october 2006 to 6 9 during the corresponding period in 2007
194666 part of a political strategy to get hamas to sign up to the quartet principles
194667 pdf in the first quarter of 2008 more palestinians were killed in gaza than in the corresponding periods in the three previous years combined and then
194668 the single biggest impediment to realising a viable palestinian state with territorial contiguity
194669 exert ed sufficient pressure on israel to open the crossings
194670 often stops short of explicit condemnation of the closures and the restrictions
194671 the uk government should have acted more robustly undertaking practical steps to secure the opening of the gaza crossing points and address settlement expansion in the west bank
194672 to create a rapid and convenient road network for the settlers
194673 route into the west bank appears to protect the presence of major settlement blocs in the west bank rather than the security of israel
194674 an agreement based on the 1967 borders with jerusalem a capital for both states and for fair and agreed arrangements with refugees
194675 the economic forecasts remain poor without a fundamental change in the current restrictions on movement and access
194676 palestinian economic revival is predicated on an integrated economic entity with freedom of movement between the west bank and gaza and within the west bank
194677 conditions in the occupied palestinian territories are close to melt down
194678 since 2006 poverty has shot up two thirds of palestinians now live in poverty a rise of 30 per cent last year the number of families unable to get enough food has risen by 14 per cent more than half of all palestinians are now are food insecure unable to meet their families daily requirements without assistance the health system is disintegrating
194679 international aid as a battering ram to force through political change
194680 the result of deliberate and reckless shooting and artillery shelling or air strikes by israeli forces carried out in densely populated areas in the gaza strip
194681 r egime change rather than security probably explains israels punishment of gaza reported last year
194682 it would be disingenuous in the extreme to minimise the role of outside players in the collapse of the national unity government the u s and the european union in particular by refusing to deal with the national unity government and only selectively engaging some of its non hamas members by maintaining economic sanctions and providing security assistance to one of the parties in order to outmanoeuvre the other they contributed mightily to the outcome they now publicly lament
194683 the international community withheld support for the national unity government itself an attempt to establish a stable and functioning government in the territories and bolstered one side against the other which increased tension between hamas and fatah
194684 if this national unity government had been given greater international support it could have provided a gateway for greater dialogue and negotiation and at the very least kept the palestinians united
194685 expanding the offer that we have already made of training for palestinian police and security forces
194686 direct result of the policies advocated by fatahs old guard and us officials in charge of palestine policy
194687 reports of a controversial us sponsored plot to oust hamas from power
194688 the building up of fatah security forces with the assistance of donors led hamas to take control of gaza in june 2007
194689 un was pummelled into submission says outgoing middle east special envoy 13 the
194690 we have to make them the palestinian people much thinner but not enough to die
194691 determination to bring down hamas rather than to build up a palestinian state
194692 israel has used f 16 fighter aircraft and apache combat helicopters to bomb lebanese and palestinian towns and villages these contain significant uk components including missile triggering systems for apaches and head up displays for f 16s
194693 see to it that any impediment resulting from the construction of the wall to the exercise by the palestinian people of its right to self determination is brought to an end
194694 the eu has decided to upgrade its relationship with israel while it continues to flout international law
194695 sometimes when grownups say forever they mean for a very long time
194696 its better being safe than sorry the risk of losing an aircraft due to weather damage is going to be an awful lot more costly
194697 i wouldnt say theres been any disagreement at all it has just taken longer due to other priorities and finding time to go through all the various aspects and steps we have had to go through
194698 were looking forward to working in the new facilities once theyre finished
194699 here are some of the words used in this report distrust frustration disconnected inaccessibility unstructured undefined unrealistic disjointed ineffective unpredictable outdated and difficult
194700 it comes down to how we have been treated in the past
194701 in my relationship with your predecessor i was not given straightforward answers
194702 safeguarding our rural schools and improving school consultation pro cedures
194703 the government is bringing out legislation to stop local authorities from closing small schools
194704 rather than close them a local authority should invest in rural communities to get them back up again
194705 the school service read the report and their conclusion was to shut schools now or we wont be able to in future
194706 any presumption against closure could tie the hands of future councils with regard to changing the overall scheme of provision especially in the light of the blueprint for education
194707 all the councillors were fed up not knowing anything about the blueprint
194708 they had a seminar in lerwick two to three weeks ago to give them an overview of the blueprint and what was happening
194709 the only important thing they found out about it was that the council were asked to make 20 pupils a minimum class size for any primaries
194710 i was hoping to hear great things about how information technology could be used in schools but there was nothing in the power point hand outs they gave us that indicated anything positive
194711 im not convinced something as important as the future plans for education in shetland can be decided between now and october when important parties like parents councils and teachers are usually on holiday from now until september
194712 it takes a while for a report to be drafted and approved after all
194713 in all the outlying schools its less than 20 pupils if they threaten to close them all hell is going to break loose
194714 if the majority of parents in yell had their wishes cast aside then what chances are there of any consultation having effect
194715 we as a community council were contacted by one person who sent us an email
194716 what that person was saying was there was a conflict and that is the last thing we want
194717 nearly all the teachers in mid yell werent in favour of shared headship if the teachers are not happy then that must reflect in the bairns education
194718 its far too early to suggest that the blueprint for education is looking at school closures
194719 the blueprint has been set out to look at a way forward for education and that is all education from the early years right up to further education and includes vocational education as well
194720 it is what it is its a blueprint a road map of where we want to go to and im not prepared to comment on closure there has never been any decision to close any school in shetland

194724 the judges had a difficult task selecting the winner in these two categories in the end the quality of the space created inside and out together with beautiful detailing sealed the award for muckle busta the contrast of a quality contemporary design against the old ruinous croft shone through for west shore the quality of detailing in these two projects and the spaces created were a joy both for the visitor and for the owners who are able to enjoy these buildings every day

194735 confinement of a prisoner alone in a cell for all or nearly all of the day with minimal environmental stimulation and minimal opportunity for social interaction can cause severe psychiatric harm this harm includes a specific syndrome which has been reported by many clinicians in a variety of settings all of which have in common features of inadequate noxious and or restricted environmental and social stimulation in more severe cases this syndrome is associated with agitation self destructive behavior and overt psychotic disorganization in addition solitary confinement often results in severe exacerbation of a previously existing mental condition or in the appearance of a mental illness where none had been observed before even among inmates who do not develop overt psychiatric illness as a result of confinement in solitary such confinement almost inevitably imposes significant psychological pain during the period of isolated confinement and often significantly impairs the inmates capacity to adapt successfully to the broader prison environment

194742 the jesus way is that of immediate guidance and fellowship all who give themselves to be led by jesus and by his good spirit become like him this is the law you become like the one you believe in enough to give yourselfself as subject and follower like leader like people like shepherd like flock to follow the blind long enough and far enough is to go blind yourself as well as into the ditch even those who follow the dry the dull and the dead also become dry dull and dead everywhere it takes the ressurected to resurrect the dead the dead are expert on burying the dead but have to become ressurected themselves before they can become channels for the abundant life of jesus
194743 the shelling was very heavy it repeatedly lit the sky and thuds of the mortar burst echoed the area
194744 so far this year the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 per cent on the same period last year
194745 greater than the number of such attacks in any other month since the end of major hostilities following the international intervention in 2001
194746 this year 2 500 people have reportedly lost their lives in the conflict and whilst exact figures are not yet available this could include up to 1 000 civilians

194751 this is a very important step for digicel we are committed to offering the best services and value for money to our customers and with wimax we will be able to contribute further to the economic growth and social development of honduras by delivering broadband mobile internet access to customers in the most densely populated locations across honduras
194752 in other markets where weve rolled out wimax services the response has been fantastic were looking forward to delighting our customers in honduras in a similar way
194753 we selected this environment to test our wimax solution because in a normal city or town you have plenty of communications channels such as umts telephony or adsl
194754 it is in extremely remote areas that it makes sense to use this wireless technology
194755 there are some coverage problems with the mobile version of wimax says martufi
194756 when you go indoors for example the coverage of mobile wimax decreases it would be interesting to develop a seamless connection allowing you to move from mobile wimax to your home network that uses wifi

194780 prius problem could using less oil make oil more expensive
194781 with all the talk in the west about curbing oil demand
194782 asking producing countries to take on the full risk of any possible but unlikely note to dutch duh over supply is not fair and is also not in the long term interest of the consumer countries
194783 what if famines in africa are making wheat more expensive for americans
194784 the unit has proved so popular because it gives label converters the chance to compete successfully in short run high end markets while enjoying low consumable costs at the same time

194793 it was the best of times it was the worst of times
194794 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s
194795 we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
194796 youre focusing on one task for a split second then focusing on another one and with something moving 40 miles an hour like a car it just takes a couple of seconds to be hit
194797 i try to take pictures with all the kids when its crazy old men trying to take my picture im sorry im strictly with the kids
194798 being famous is overwhelming and theres a lot to think about to know there are hundreds of kids out there that look up to me i know thats a big responsibility
194799 i am also very confident to say that it is wonderful and ill do my best that i can do to be the best role model i can be
194800 the number of teams has gone up not gone down since july 1
194801 there are other teams that have said were that interested in a short term one to two year deal
194802 so i dont think the demand will slow down if he takes longer
194803 when he was speaking in sweden about august unfortunately a lot of people picked up on aug 1 he meant some time in august he would definitely decide because hell definitely be in training camp
194804 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
194805 uh any ideas on how to handle this piece of work
194806 when the adult wolves see pups it all kind of comes together theyre also bringing food to them
194807 whenever wolves have anxiety theres a chance they can redirect that to each other
194808 we suspect theyll beg more because they wont have been fed the adults having just eaten will be more relaxed and more likely to regurgitate for the pups
194809 the next thing i know i got through another day
194810 laughter is just like a vitamin that you take every day
194811 its another one of those healthy behaviors that we all should do like eating right and exercising
194812 things will be kind of hectic the first week with the traffic situation and just generally getting use to a new academic year
194813 the problem is that with the start of a new school year parents want to be able to take their kids to school to ensure a proper send off but with gas prices at an all time high we are encouraging parents to let children ride the bus instead this will also help relieve issues with traffic congestion
194814 we hope that everyone will just be patient until things get settled in
194815 it may take a couple of weeks but after that things should be running smoothly
194816 hes kind of an asshole toward everyone unless they can do something for him
194817 cash knows what hes doing theres nothing out there to replace ponson but soon someone like ian kennedy phil hughes alfredo aceves or even carl pavano should be able to step into the yankees rotation and help out and they also recently signed victor zambrano and eric milton
194818 through the dialogues mutual nunderstanding between the different communities was restored
194819 nevertheless it must be stressed that what really triggered the process of inter community dialogues was the deliberate demonization of islam and muslims by the western media
194820 oh caroline is a song i wrote for a girl i was dating who has cancer
194821 theyd treat her and it just kept coming back i felt awful and i wrote it as a little poem for her
194822 her name isnt caroline by the way i just changed her name in the song because she has the same name as one of my aunts and i thought that would be weird
194823 everything i do in this town is fight for my players and everyone likes to hammer and hammer and hammer how horseshit i am
194824 i dont understand the people out there i dont get it i sit with kenny williams and we try to do stuff and all of a sudden we get pounded like we dont try or dont care to do good for the fans or for us and i dont get it
194825 im going to rip a lot of people apart if we win this thing this year enough is enough
194826 but his last two starts would be against cc sabathia of the brewers and peavy thats not fair
194827 every time he doesnt get a hit his odds of getting a hit go up every time
194828 still inexplicable is the reds penchant for playing to the level of the competition good against teams with records above 500 32 29 and bad against teams with records below 500 16 23 the next 12 games are against poor record teams san diego colorado houston washington baker said it is sometimes more difficult to play teams like the padres they have about 10 new guys and we dont know much about em its like september call ups you cant overlook anybody especially teams like san diego that you dont know much about
194829 beyond the obvious benefit to his ledger though baker believes it would be good for the organization and the town if the reds produce their first winning season since 2000
194830 its a funny thing about it i like people when they are good i dont like people when they are bad and they are cocky when you are good and cocky thats fine with me but when you arent that good and you try to pretend like you are that good
194831 he showed a couple of my players up and i dont like that he showed my dugout up in that inning and thats why i screamed at him the only reason i was screaming is because he was not professional
194832 the law of averages is on our side big time
194833 h is lineup construction and in game decisions make him an easy target for critics baker craves speed at the top of the lineup even if it means using patterson and his 293 career on base percentage he also asked three of his best power hitters edwin encarnacion dunn and votto to bunt late in games because thats how i was taught to play never mind that all three are capable of moving runners over and driving them in with one swing encarnacion and dunn did just that each failed to execute a sacrifice bunt then hit a game ending home run
194834 the unfortunate thing for me is its a shame that a certain segment of chicago refused to enjoy a baseball championship being brought to their city
194835 people think that we dwell on it all day but we dont guillen said before dwelling on it were just stating facts we know we will never be respected like the cubs we wont all we ask is just be fair with our organization you love the cubs more here fine but be fair you dont have to like us you dont have to love us our players expect that its not a jealousy or us feeling like were the second part of the city because we know that already
194836 i dont believe in that ive heard enough of that shit in chicago
194837 sometimes its outfielders sometimes its pitchers if that was the case i was cursed before i got here because gonzo was hurt was before i got here
194838 i know everybody says that and he could probably do it but how many guys do you want out of position you want one or you want two or three
194839 i just talked to him about my experience with batting leadoff and just hit the same
194840 i know hes not your prototypical leadoff hitter but neither is hanley ramirez bobby bonds alfonso soriano chris young
194841 im going to have to get corey patterson in there sometime because hes starting to swing the bat good again
194842 i always thought as a player that it was easier to play on the road
194843 i dont believe in that ive heard enough of that shit in chicago
194844 sometimes its outfielders sometimes its pitchers if that was the case i was cursed before i got here because gonzo was hurt was before i got here
194845 i know everybody says that and he could probably do it but how many guys do you want out of position you want one or you want two or three
194846 i just talked to him about my experience with batting leadoff and just hit the same
194847 i know hes not your prototypical leadoff hitter but neither is hanley ramirez bobby bonds alfonso soriano chris young
194848 im going to have to get corey patterson in there sometime because hes starting to swing the bat good again
194849 all youve got to do is worry about eating and going to the ballpark basically you can turn your phone off if you want you dont have to worry about kids waking you up your life is simplified
194850 our team was built for our strategy as a power hitting team
194851 were a team that really depends on home runs sometimes balls dont go out on the road as well as they go out at our park
194852 if baker can keep his office door locked he plans to give ken griffey jr today off
194853 watch all the kids and how they gravitate toward me
194854 the people i get along best with honestly are elderly people and young people the people that dont like me most of the time are people my own age because i dont think like them
194855 if you think baker was oblivious to the surplus of young talent when he signed a three year deal in october guess again
194856 heck yeah that was one of the things that sold me baker said it was one of the things that sold me with the cubs before i go someplace i ask somebody to research for me what they got coming
194857 for those who suggest hes anti youth baker points out that he has run a baseball school in california the past 25 years and has a 9 year old son darren scampering around the house though bakers teams in san francisco generally were veteran oriented hed find a place for a royce clayton here and a marvin benard or darren lewis there if they were ready to contribute he did the same in chicago for matt murton and ronny cedeno
194858 sometimes i create my own problems thats me im going to say what i have to say some people say the same stuff i say but they dont get attacked like i do
194859 i love this job dont get me wrong but sometimes its like wow is it worth it to put up with this stuff
194860 i expect kenny to do something tuesday because if we dont do anything tuesday theres going to be a lot of change in the lineup
194861 i put the lineup the way it should be i didnt make any changes because i still believe
194862 i was going to call corey in to talk to me and he came in before i could call him in
194863 hes still one of the best runners in the game hes got an outstanding throwing arm hes an outstanding outfielder sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you can make a change im not just going on whether i like or dislike somebody no i like the skill i know skill when i see skill i know talent when i see talent if he was 35 it might be different
194864 once again the reds seem to be road vagabonds not even close to being kings of the road lose lose lose if baker could fix it he would whats a manager to do
194865 weve covered this he said no 1 get the lead and then keep it this has gone on before i came here it is hard to change things overnight its an attitude a mindset and i havent put my finger on it yet
194866 im still really assessing things im trying to decipher a lot of things
194867 but we play for the home run every other ball park is bigger than ours and were going to have to change the form of this club in order to have a chance to win
194868 managers were on a conference call wednesday concerning orders for umpires to enforce rules to speed up games and baker said hey man i aint got no opinion on this because they dont ask me and it doesnt matter what i say
194869 based on his offensive numbers this season putting struggling reds center fielder corey patterson in the leadoff spot seems to be the equivalent of putting the square peg in the round hole
194870 yet for the 21st time in his 22 starts this season patterson was perched at the top of the order on monday vs the marlins coming in he was batting just 196 with a 252 on base percentage over 34 games that included a 2 for 18 skid
194871 what makes it kind of rough is im trying to stay away from too many left handers in a row
194872 hes going to get going usually guys end up where their average always is jacoby is working with him we dont have a bunch of speed we need speed especially in close games
194873 and if we win it all again oh man i will be so cocky this time they wont be able to stand my ass i will rub it in peoples faces
194874 whos the manager they remember the most billy martin they dont remember sparky anderson they remember billy martin because he was the crazy one why do you think people like lou piniella because lou is good great guy great baseball people but people love lou piniella because hes fucked up
194875 cincinnati reds manager dusty baker gave shortstop jeff keppinger a day off while placing corey patterson and jerry hairston jr at the top of the batting order
194876 before sundays game an unnamed player positioned two nude female blow up dolls in the clubhouse with bats belonging to most of the players fanned out around them almost resembling a voodoo ritual to get the club going and loosen up a suddenly uptight clubhouse
194877 several toronto newspapers made it a big deal and the sox were feeling the backlash by monday afternoon if those offended were expecting an apology from guillen however they must not know him very well
194878 one hundred percent of the people in the clubhouse are 18 years old and thats a private thing
194879 if the players do it in the dugout where everyone can see or in the hotel lobby we did it in our clubhouse and a lot of things happen in the clubhouse
194880 one day after joking that his son oney could play second base guillen went on a tirade after a reporter jokingly asked him if class a outfielder john shelby jr could get promoted after hitting three home runs in a game
194881 right now everyone in chicago is making lineups call up this guy call up that guy
194882 if we had 50 people allowed on the roster we could do that thats what ticks me off about chicago fans and chicago media they forget pretty quickly a couple of days ago we were the bleeping best stuff in town now were bleep
194883 we won it a couple years ago and were horse bleep
194884 the cubs havent won in 100 years and theyre the bleeping best bleep it were good bleep everybody were horse bleep and were going to be horse bleep the rest of our lives no matter how many world series we win
194885 we have the worst owner jerry reinsdorf the guys got seven bleeping rings and hes the bleeping horse bleep owner
194886 how about the cubs celebrating that lee elia bull bleep
194887 yeah we have to celebrate all that stuff too but i wont be around for 10 years believe me
194888 thats not going to happen guillen said of a possible coaching change to try to remedy the slumping offense to be honest with you i dont think we need coaches
194889 your boys shouldnt need you to get kicked out to get motivated thats my opinion
194890 were not the type of club to complain about every pitch
194891 i could have bought big land in venezuela with that money
194892 tell jose canseco to get a job and leave the game alone
194893 i get tired of people who have left the game and come out with that stuff its unprofessional he could have made a lot of money with a book on hitting or a book about his life and his family but people like to make money on negative stuff
194894 its very very harsh in chicago i dont think theres a manager who has been there who hasnt said chicago especially with the north side fans and the media can be brutally harsh and sometimes unfairly harsh ill be the first to say it i think the media was completely unfair with dusty i think it was the medias doing that basically caused the change
194895 maybe i was chosen for this situation it seems like ive been in and out of something like this my whole life sometimes you ask the lord why me then you get the answer why not me
194896 i wasnt used to that especially when in your own mind you believe you have the midas touch then when that midas touch isnt working you realize how much is out of your control
194897 i was on the los angeles dodgers all time team as an outfielder i was on the all time san francisco giants team as the manager i started out great in chicago and then ended up on the all nothing team im not used to that
194898 on base percentage thats fine and dandy but a lot of times guys get so much into on base percentage that they cease to swing its becoming a little bit out of control the name of the game is scoring runs sometimes you get so caught up in on base percentage that youre clogging up the bases

194925 we use ip to allocate value and create incentives in society
194926 just like many other powerful tools ip can be very useful but it can also be difficult to work with you can easily shoot yourself in the foot with intellectual property if you dont understand how and why this tool works
194927 in fact i would argue that for most businesses in the united states the intellectual property part of the business is the most valuable part of the business
194928 we are starting to see a swing away from stronger intellectual property protections and towards more openness and collaboration
194929 people frequently have the mistaken impression that open source or free software is the opposite of intellectual property that is absolutely wrong

195269 yeah high powered concentrated microwaves for cooking people if you know what i mean
195270 but death rays have these low powered settings and at that low end death rays are exactly the same as heat rays
195271 look im not allowed to highlight how a death ray is a third of the price of a heat ray
195272 yeah but how can it be so much cheaper if its more powerful and can cook people
195273 if its perfectly safe then how again is this a death ray
195274 but lets just say and you replace my steering cylinder without my asking
195275 yeah i know that lets just say okay its an analogy now im not obligated to pay for that new steering cylinder am i if its added to my bill without my consent
195276 depends does this mechanic get to keep the steering cylinder if you refuse to pay for it
195277 in this analogy the steering cylinders the resistance room you charged me for its not the baby
195278 i wouldnt know anything about that this analogy isnt working for me because im not an auto mechanic
195279 how can my wifes pregnancy be a pre existing condition
195280 was she a blue light member before she became pregnant
195281 so was she a blue light member before she became pregnant
195282 well everything seems in order but im afraid our appeals procedure is limited to 180 days this really shouldve been taken care of earlier
195283 well im not sure what you want me to do now you already have your baby
195284 i want you to pay the claim i want you to pay the hospital so their collections people will leave us alone
195285 yeah im just not sure what you want me to do its like youre harboring all this rage for something that happened so long ago
195286 but its still happening i still havent been able to get you people to pay the claim
195287 i dont appreciate that you people remark but if youll calm down then maybe we can talk about this
195288 now i dont think we should have to pay for something we didnt authorize
195289 how do you expect to teach juniper about firearm safety if your gun can only be used to kill people
195290 you want me to teach her about firearm safety but you hate guns youre all about loving your enemies
195291 look im going to keep it away from june entirely
195292 now are you going to be home saturday she has a playdate with the heller girl
195293 just planting seeds its more for us parents to meet than for them at this point
195294 unless you dont want us to have friends because youre planning to shoot everybody with your death ray
195295 you know were more likely to use it on ourselves than on a burglar
195296 the batteries arent user replaceable theres a finite number of times i can charge this thing
195297 its come to my attention you might have brought an incendiary device into the office environment
195298 its on the lowest setting its just like a heat ray on its lowest setting
195299 yeah but you cant have that here you cant bring that to work anymore
195300 someone gets hurt they could sue the company thats the whole reason for the cubicle gel
195301 i could slip in the hallway because of the gel whats to stop me from suing if i dont use the heat ray
195302 no not as a death ray i mean its been used as a heat ray on the lowest setting like you said
195303 but i want to buy a more expensive item i want to put it towards an actual heat ray
195304 its not like you have a death ray or anything
195305 what about replacing his heat ray with your death ray
195306 its just you spent all that money and youre not even going to use it
195307 oh and would you do something with those sunglasses of yours
195308 something that expensive would you risk taking it into the gel with you
195309 so youre just gonna take it youre okay with that
195310 id rather just break it or turn it on and aim it at geneboy while he works
195311 over a few hours through the walls itll probably give him a rash or something

195324 me too outlook 2007 with exchange calendar wont push updates to mobileme everything else looks ok
195325 i should let you know that the exchange server is probably what is causing the problem for some reason it causes a conflict with mobileme and the only way around it is to disable it

195340 the ig will find enough evidence to refer the matter to a special prosecutor there will be more than enough evidence to make that recommendation
195341 i believe that when the rest of the report drops it will show the civil rights section was compromised in terms of their core historic mission which is representing minorities
195342 i am hearing preliminarily those classic cases were not prosecuted which if true is a remarkable turn of events
195343 he took multiple phone calls from domenici concerning iglesias urging that he be replaced and has admitted that president george w bush spoke with him about the problems with iglesias
195344 gonzales has even admitted that one of the reasons that iglesias was fired was because sen domenici had lost confidence in iglesias
195345 while these allegations are troubling under any analysis a thorough and independent investigation is necessary to determine whether criminal laws have been violated
195346 under the broad language of the federal statute regarding obstruction of justice it would be hard to imagine that corruptly influence would not extend to firing of the united states attorney in the middle of a public corruption case because he lost confidence of a senator who sought to manipulate the indictments for crass political advantage
195347 mcnulty also may have sought to conceal an important phone call from sen domenici regarding u s attorney iglesias instructing then justice department liaison to the white house monica goodling to delete reference to that call from his senate testimony
195348 lam alerted the justice department that fbi agents would at her direction search foggos home in connection with the duke cunningham case and the following day former gonzales chief of staff kyle sampson e mailed the white house from the attorney generals office that we have a real problem with carol lam and urged that she be dismissed at the conclusion of her term
195349 given the wide publicity of the cunningham political corruption case it is reasonable to conclude that gonzales mcnulty sampson and other senior justice department officials were aware of the underlying judicial proceeding being handled by carol lam
195350 there is no way he is going to right this ship thats sinking in five months
195351 the allegation is false i didnt withhold information from the deputy
195352 proceeded to say let me tell you what i can remember and he laid out for me his general recollection of some of the process
195353 he asked me if i had any reaction to his iteration
195354 i havent talked to witnesses because of the fact that i havent wanted to interfere with this investigation and department investigations
195355 i was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on
195356 i felt nothing was going to happen but i was told that the people who work in those offices are career people they are not politicos
195357 this is not going away with a new president the fact that the justice department is the agency that enforces individual rights and they were violating those rights is just a really awful situation what do you do when the watchdog isnt watching
195358 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
195359 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
195360 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
195361 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
195362 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
195363 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
195364 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
195365 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
195366 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
195367 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
195368 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child

195502 aided and abetted by the actions of tom cruise his right hand man for foreign and domestic promotion as well as for foreign and domestic lobbying he has assisted the syndicate in acquiring funds and made his own donations of money believed to be in the multiple tens of millions of dollars

195504 when is the appropriate time to wear a fur stole
195505 when is the appropriate time to wear a fur stole
195506 you can watch this show even if you dont give a damn about dancing

195511 this is the end of my number one klumtastic fantasy mayonnaise sandwiches followed by sexual intercourse
195512 fortunately they were both in a stable condition and were transported by ambulance to a private hospital for further assessment and treatment
195513 michael ian black presents the 8 awesomest custom vans in the history of awesome
195514 our apprehension has come true with the statement by the former special envoy to us state secretary on the indo us deal the prime minister has misled the nation by making a statement that hyde act will have no impact on the agreement
195515 it vindicates our stand that hyde act cannot be separated from the agreement
195516 acharya also a party central committee member said that india cannot escape the provisions of the contentious hyde act of the us linking suspension of nuclear fuel supply to future atomic tests by india
195517 a number of times the prime minister and other union ministers have said that the hyde act has nothing to do with the agreement
195518 we will be there in large numbers the anc president is in court
195519 fire officials arrived at the scene fought the blaze and it was finally contained it did not spread to any of the other shacks
195520 just like radio marketing just like tv marketing just like direct mail marketing the legal aspects associated with e mail marketing are not for amateurs anymore
195521 its got to be a single page and thats not an ubiquitous practice in marketing
195522 thats fine when its just one advertiser in the message
195523 but when its two or three or four it quickly becomes untenable it wasnt a workable situation to pass a whole bunch of suppression files and get back a bunch of suppression files
195524 initiates a commercial electronic message in which it advertises or promotes its own goods services or internet web site and is identified uniquely in the from line of the message
195525 now a list owner can say to advertisers we take the hit on the opt out
195526 the can spam act doesnt say what to advertise or that your advertisement must be the most prominent it just says you have to advertise
195527 this message is brought to you by acme marketing to learn more about our company and the services we offer please click here
195528 while the can spam rules are relatively clear they can become incredibly complicated depending on the context in which youre doing your marketing
195529 as a result youve got to have somebody who knows what hes talking about look at your stuff
195530 ta hun ini kami menambah kursi untuk mahasiswa baru lewat snmptn yang tahun lalu jumlahnya hanya 2 800 an
195531 kalau masyarakat tidak menghendaki nggak usah beli ya nggak apa kita kembalikan
195532 dirjen saja camry padahal yang melantik mereka cuma setingkat menteri kalau mau objektif bandingkan dengan departemen lain dan hal itu tidak ada yang meributkan
195533 jadi tidak beli mobil saat itu kemudian tahun 2008 dianggarkan lagi tapi jumlahnya dikurangi kalau dulu rp 400 juta per mobil sekarang rp 300 juta nanti plenonya tunggu cairnya anggaran
195534 mobil yang ada sekarang sudah sering ngadat mobil saya itu accord 2001 selama satu bulan ini sudah masuk bengkel dua kali
195535 harapan kami yang seragam yang jelas kami nggak ingin yang mewah seperti volvo atau bmw
195536 saya adalah orang melayu tetapi masalah kaum cina india dan sebagainya adalah masalah saya juga yang saya akan sedaya upaya selesaikan
195537 where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works 55 is not this the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and are not his brothers james and joseph and simon and judas 56 and are not all his sisters with us where then did this man get all this
195538 a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house
195539 and i saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride adorned for her husband
195540 the second quarter this year has been one of the fastest changing markets i have ever seen
195541 kami akan menunggu tiga hari apakah ada gugatan dari pasangan calon atau tidak walaupun mereka tidak mengajukan keberatan tetapi tahapan ini tidak boleh dihilangkan
195542 who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of the sinners or sit in the seat of the mockers he has 3 different people here in three different posistions walking standing and sitting in the wrong position
195543 the lords curse is on the house of the wicked but he blesses the home of the righteous he mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble the wise inherit honor but fools he holds up to shame
195544 he is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither whatever he does prospers
195545 and provide for tose who grieve in zion to bestow on them a crwn of beauty instead of ashes the oil of glasness instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair they will be called oaks of righteousness a planting of the lord for the display of his splendor
195546 in your lovely movements shiver my bones with not fear but a joy like admiring bright red balloons
195547 ya know yeah yeah i do i wanna be a psychologist
195548 did you once answer an email with the title wanna be a psychologist
195549 there are consequences diplomatically for defying the just demands of the security council
195550 its clear this is the other side of the two track approach
195551 nobody is really desirous of going down that pathway the p 5 plus one does not want it
195552 this is serious stuff and we along with the p 5 plus one are absolutely prepared to go down that pathway should the iranian regime take the world down that pathway
195553 taking one step back against arrogant powers will lead them to take one step forward
195554 the idea that any retreat or backing down from righteous positions would change the policies of arrogant world powers is completely wrong and baseless
195555 we have reached agreement regarding gazprom financing and building the new main gas pipelines from the east of the country developing gas fields and boosting the capacity of the turkmen sector of the caspian gas pipeline to 30 billion cubic meters
195556 both china and russia kept silent on the details of the consensus they reached on energy cooperation in the first round of their negotiation in beijing on the weekend
195557 it seems that a shift of russias energy export policy is under way russia might turn its eyes from the western countries to the asia pacific region the cooperation in the energy sector is an issue of great significance for sino russian relations the political and geographic closeness of the two countries would put their energy cooperation under a safe umbrella and make it a win win deal china russia ties are at their best times the two sides settled their lingering border disputes held joint military exercises and enjoyed rapidly increasing bilateral trade
195558 moscow finds the idea of coordination of gas production and pricing policy with other gas exporters to be too tempting to abandon
195559 this forum of gas exporters will set up the global gas balance it will give answers to the questions concerning when where and how much gas should be produced
195560 we have not only approved these agreements but have also decided to supervise their implementation
195561 i look forward to seeing all of you in venezuela
195562 to see the iraqi people in charge of iraq for the first time in generations
195563 an even more radical form of shock therapy than pursued in the former soviet world
195564 to exercise united states control over the oil infrastructure or oil resources of iraq
195565 baby you are more lovely by accident than most women are who work for hours trying to get that way
195566 she cannot usurp the partnerships business for herself at the partnerships and your expense
195567 courts are very unsympathetic to people who engage in oppressive conduct she would be much better off simply buying you out for a fair price and then conducting the business as she sees fit
195568 its very important for you to consult an attorney at this time
195569 you might want to start getting tough with this partner whos making threats
195570 even many legitimate career coaches impart advice from a theoretical perspective since they have little or no field experience
195571 if you needed surgery would you rather have it done by someone who has performed the operation before or by someone who has only studied it
195572 your coach should be active and visible in the industry
195573 you want a coach for whom coaching was a first career choice not a default choice that he or she may not be 100 committed to
195574 to get the most bang for your buck its generally better to conduct your sessions one on one
195575 a good coach should be able to help you determine your overall goals
195576 even before that you should establish specific milestones when can you expect to see results and what might those results look like
195577 anyone who charges for a first meeting raises a red flag
195578 try to find out in advance how often the person has had to give someone a refund and for what reason
195579 many good coaches have been obliged to do this and those with integrity will be willing to explain those situations without hesitation
195580 it looked like it just came off the showroom floor but the motor was absolutely shot absolutely worn out
195581 when you put that ethanol in here it eats up the insides or rusts them out
195582 all the rubber gaskets and parts it eats those up
195583 theyre starving for gas because the little needle holes in them are stopped up with the gel that happens when that stuff breaks down
195584 when you mix ethanol with your fuel youve now put a chemical substance in there thats going to attract moisture which is going to promote a quicker deterioration of the fuel that you have
195585 the alcohol actually dissipates the oil so on a two cycle engine youre lubricating the engine but the oil is being pushed away so its actually not lubricating the engine
195586 people will tell you you can take the gas out of them and it wont happen but its the residue that does the damage
195587 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
195588 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
195589 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
195590 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
195591 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
195592 mysterious and passionate figure whose mission in life was to collect menus
195593 dewey what do you want me to pray about for you
195594 hey cher do you really need to make all that money
195595 is anybody supposed to be moderating or am i doing this thing alone
195596 ok well i have no idea why youre here because alex ross is having a panel now too
195597 my name is howard chaykin and i am very grateful for your attention as i have always been over the years
195598 delaying the thing for three and a half years just so it can come out for the collapse of the economy
195599 in that time i never worked on a show that i would watch
195600 i came back to comics having no idea if i could still draw because i hadnt even drawn anything in 12 years
195601 because i have to keep reinventing myself im always learning to compete with guys whose fathers are younger than i am
195602 i moved to southern california because i knew i would never be a crowd pleaser creator like john byrne or chris claremont
195603 as technology arrives you embrace it and use it and you dont look back
195604 bloggers should jerk off stalk somebody or do something socially acceptable like holding up a liquor store
195605 comics right now as shitty as the business is with everything falling apart are visually beautiful theyve never looked better than they do right now
195606 everybody at dc at the time insisted that i could have done flagg for them but thats not true i only got away with all that stuff because i was working with first comics
195607 im a child of popular front democrats which means for those of you that arent old they believed they had to fight against fascism my family were pretty arch liberal but weird the only god we believed in was franklin delano roosevelt
195608 im not a man of profound faith no gurus no method no master
195609 anybody under 18 who would actually be interested in sitting and listening to me is obviously on drugs
195610 if id known the movie was going to be so successful i would have done a better job
195611 each issue will be a decade of the 20th century with the filth appropriate to that decade
195612 i see myself as someone who is interested in being interested
195613 i could be arrested at least 20 times a day for what im thinking politically morally sexually
195614 im sort of fascinated by the whole concept of professional mercenaries but again theyre not working for me theyre working for your president ladies and gentlemen
195615 i have no favorite characters its the execution that matters you have to have a detachment from the material
195616 as an american i take for granted a lot of ideas that are in the process of being denied to me and my attitude towards that is fuck that
195617 the things to do are the things that need doing that you see need to be done and that no one else seems to see need to be done
195618 reflects the boards confidence in the continued growth of suns business and an ongoing commitment to increase shareholder value
195619 we remain confident in open source innovation as the accelerant to our growth strategy through increased adoption of our open source offerings
195620 we assume 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
195621 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the us dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker us economy
195622 we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
195623 we have shown that b serrata enriched with akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
195624 certainly osteoarthritis is in need of new safe analgesics although many effective therapies that reduce pain such as muscle strengthening exercises shock absorbing footwear and weight loss have very few bad side effects
195625 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
195626 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
195627 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
195628 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
195629 were not going negative in return were refuting the charges
195630 its a great ad and everybodys talking about it and were having a great time with it
195631 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
195632 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
195633 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
195634 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
195635 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
195636 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
195637 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
195638 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
195639 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
195640 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
195641 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
195642 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
195643 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
195644 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
195645 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
195646 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
195647 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
195648 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
195649 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
195650 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
195651 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
195652 have carried out a wave of unlawful arrests against opponents in recent days
195653 hamas forces physically abused some of the people they apprehended
195654 it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all of the agencys legal requirements
195655 the agreement is a sound one based on the iaeas approved safeguards system
195656 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards
195657 threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent
195658 smart funny can dance up a storm and perform skits with you
195659 forgetting all the hurt inside youve learned to hide so well pretending someone else can come and save me from myself i cant be who you are
195660 a friend is someone who knows the song in your heart and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words
195661 prime mnister yousaf raza gilani glossed over some of the threats emanating fron pakistan at a meeting of the council on foreign relations and the middle east institute nationalists in the areawise baluchistan province say they solution lies in balkanizing pakistan on the lines of the former soviet union
195662 a conversation with syed yousaf raza gilani prime minister islamic republic of pakistan
195663 dancing with the dictators have always come to haunt the world
195664 this is not charlie wilsons war this is benazir bhuttos war
195665 khan has committed crimes against the baluch people by testing an atomic bomb in chagai he has committed crimes against humanity in partnership with the pakistani army by running a nuclear flea market promoting nuclear technology to rogue states like iran north korea and libya
195666 the tests showed the plight of baluchistan is worse than darfur i want to take the pakistan army generals to answer before the international criminal court at the hague
195667 no head of government will say his secret service is trying to screw him up
195668 ninety nine percent of the people are patriots only a handful of them want to destabilize the country
195669 gilani is totally right in that the 1973 constitution offered a solution though baluch nationalist may disagree
195670 the problem is the 1973 constitution has never been respected by the successive military or the civilian governments the violations were more blatant under military rule
195671 i know there are many baluch who are not willing to be part of pakistan but there are others who say they want autonomy under the 1973 constitution
195672 the provincial autonomy slogan is a ruse to continue the illegal occupation of baluchistan and exploit its resources at gun point we want nothing short of sovereignty over our resources
195673 this was a recipe for greater tension between the military and the civilian sections of the government
195674 that is exactly the reason why the overwhelming majority of baluch people 97 percent or more want the isaf to replace pakistan army in baluchistan
195675 h pouco tempo para a vida pessoal mas quando vejo minha irm com tr s filhos penso que o estilo de vida dela n o para mim
195676 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
195677 its his voice but im going inside his head to speak some psychological truth about him
195678 no one is closer to mccain than salter who has been with him since 1989
195679 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out
195680 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
195681 our nation has a unique place in the world we are the greatest force for good on earth we chart historys course yes we must be involved in the destiny of other nations
195682 history of the decline and fall of the roman empire
195683 enter public life determined to tell the truth to put problem solving ahead of partisanship to defend the public interest against the special interests to risk your personal ambitions for the sake of the country and the ideals that make her great keep your promise to america and you will keep your honor you will know a happiness far more sublime than pleasure
195684 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president in truth id had the ambition for a long time
195685 some view the flag as a symbol of slavery others view it as a symbol of heritage personally i see the battle flag as a symbol of heritage
195686 should be lowered forever from the staff atop south carolinas capitol
195687 i had promised to tell the truth no matter what
195688 when i broke it i had not just been dishonest i had been a coward and i had severed my own interests from my countrys that was what made the lie unforgivable
195689 driven less by thought and more by feelings this doesnt mean hes totally reactive or without logic or thought processes it just means hes a fighter pilot he reacts to circumstances
195690 in the many many years that ive been in washington
195691 john mccain is far and away the most emotional politician i have ever met
195692 people dont understand that so they keep talking about his temperament his temper he reacts emotionally therefore unpredictably
195693 there is no such thing as compromise you either win or you lose
195694 we lost in vietnam because we lost the will to fight because we did not understand the nature of the war we were fighting and because we limited the tools at our disposal
195695 all i can say is they the iraqis are establishing the rule of law theyre going to be having elections and i think theyre becoming an effective government which is what our strategy was thanks to the genius of a guy named david petraeus
195696 occupation of undetermined length at undetermined cost with undetermined consequences
195697 uma taxa expressiva a ind stria j no primeiro semestre do ano passado cresceu nessa faixa de 6 e manteve o ritmo bom frisar que o segundo semestre do ano passado que a base de compara o que entra teve um desempenho elevado para se garantir esse 6 at o final do ano ter de haver uma acelera o daqui para frente j que h uma base mais alta
195698 essa acelera o fruto principalmente de um crescimento mais forte entre ve culos e m quinas e equipamentos e mais recentemente da atividade de constru o
195699 esse forte desempenho do setor de bens de capital dever jogar a favor da taxa de investimento medida no resultado do pib produto interno bruto do primeiro semestre
195700 esses setores s o importantes e vem tendo um crescimento superior a dois d gitos h muito tempo dif cil manter esse ritmo diante de uma base forte como a do ano passado
195701 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
195702 our findings suggest but cannot prove that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated and if cpap is the prescribed treatment regular use may prevent premature death
195703 there are those who may know a great deal who havent come forward
195704 there are other people who know things but for a variety of reasons some people are reticent about coming forward
195705 if we allow these kind of companies to decide at the behest of governments that repress their people to restrict access to information then we are actually facilitating that oppression
195706 there is an onus on us to speak out for the voiceless in china who have no right to protest no right to freedom of speech no right of access to the media
195707 what we have here is a clear case of censorship its as simple and as clear cut as that the irish government and the european commission need to make absolutely clear that we will not be complicit in censorship we will not tolerate the ongoing subjugation of chinese peoples rights
195708 ntdtvs broadcasts irked the chinese government because thanks to this satellite they could be freely received in tens of millions of chinese homes
195709 their suspension just a few weeks ahead of the olympic games looks like a favour provided by eutelsat with the aim of obtaining new deals eutelsat tried to drop ntdtv once before in 2005 but an international campaign forced it to sign a new long term contract
195710 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed
195711 basescu si tariceanu au in interiorul lor ceva impotriva tiganetului dar nu o recunosc
195712 the court has decided that as nevzlin poses a special threat to society he should serve life in a high security prison
195713 the jade warrior cd has arrived safely and is seen in the attached picture hovering over the san francisco bay im listening to it right now very fine stuff though quite different indeed from past jade warrior releases thank you very much
195714 http ns adobe com air framework update configuration 1 0
195715 foot to foot shoulder to shoulder fill in the gaps
195716 we wanted to have a more central location because it was hard for the men who work to get all the way to myrtle grove on fridays to come to prayers on their lunch breaks
195717 when you go to the middle east theres a mosque on every corner our mosques in america need to be more of a civic center where muslims can practice and incorporate their family life here
195718 we want people to call and ask us to come speak at their organization about islam
195719 we have a large teen population and they need leadership and guidance making it religious fun and so they can bond with other muslims
195720 because there are not a lot of muslims in the school system they feel like the minority so we wanted them to have a place where they could be together
195721 islam is a blessing and a mercy from allah we are chosen to be muslims
195722 we cant be bare minimum muslims for those who believe allah will never make your good deeds go lost
195723 the ladies are really excited about this because were all converts
195724 hes starting a whole new life like a newborn child because hes worshipping one god
195725 people dont realize that islam is not a closed religion its a way of life
195726 what we were looking into was the importation and sale of these replica firearms mainly in the lower mainland
195727 it should be like at airports everything gets checked even your body gets checked
195728 it should be the same thing for buses people should be safer on the bus because now i dont feel safe
195729 a lot of people have talked about airport style security but the rural nature of our network doesnt allow us to have that type of security
195730 i also want to acknowledge the driver and the other passengers on the bus
195731 the ioc coordination commission and bocog met last night and agreed internet use will be just like in any olympics
195732 das stimmt gar nicht es wird ja alles erh ht
195733 wir m ssen uns schon berlegen ob wir ein steak nehmen oder lieber gehacktes
195734 aber sonst k nnte ich mir ja gar nichts mehr leisten
195735 was viertelj hrlich abgebucht wird leg ich mir weg man muss sich ja selbst berlisten sonst habe ich in dem monat auf einmal kein geld mehr
195736 und ich bibbere dass ich ja nichts an den z hnen krieg
195737 biagi fatevi dire da maroni se era una figura centrale era un rompicoglioni che voleva il rinnovo del contratto di consulenza
195738 dopo tanti sacrifici anni di lavoro e qualche vita umana si costruita questa modernissima centrale dove tutto controllato e tutto sicuro
195739 the cosi on 6th ave and 13th street is not only gone but the place is totally cleaned out only a week ago it was in full operation i wonder if it was doh that closed them down thought maybe it was noteworthy bc of the recent dohing of the one uptown
195740 just walked by pintxos which hasnt been open for lunch all summer and all the doors and windows were open with big sale signs posted outside inside there were some guys in chefs whites and some brown boxes filled with what i assume were the supplies they were selling off
195741 after several decades of serving traditional french fare at 325 west 57th street
195742 und das obwohl wir wissen dass die meisten krebserkrankungen mit todesfolge bei frauen auftreten die drei bis f nf jahre nicht mehr beim frauenarzt waren
195743 man kann sich ja vorstellen welches signal an die kollegen geht wenn man jetzt unmittelbar nach der einf hrung des programms bereits eine k rzung der honorare diskutiert

195777 jarrods gonna be here ine 3 days i have to finish this finish finish
195778 although the day had begun quite sensibly we knew by 10 38 p m that we had entered another dimension after a swell meal downstairs we retired to the garden room to recall our youth we had coddled and prepared all the parts of our bodies which at our ages require attention each and every night and turned out the blue light and snuggled under the covers just as carl was making advances and things were getting hot under the sheets a blue shadow crossed the bed our heads whipped around and any thoughts of romance folded the ghost after glancing at herself in the large mirror arranged her skirts and plopped on the shelf and dresser and looked us square in the face carl pulled the blanket up to his eyes and i sat bolt upright the ghost began to whistle and fix her nails after some minutes she floated to my side of the bed the window side and pinched my bottom which was still encased in a black lace thing i had bought for this special night our anniversary startled by this display of familiarity from a ghost i had only just seen nine minutes before i leaped from the bed ran to the bathroom and into the little toilet closet no sooner had i turned around than the door slammed back i heard the ghost give a slight whoosh in the morning there on my side of the bed was a blue hair ribbon and a false fingernail
195779 my husband laughed about the legend of the blue light ghost and turned on the light to signal his receptiveness
195780 although dee dee refused to turn on the blue light im sure the ghosts presence evoked the passionate love making i believe the lady of the blue ghost provoked such passionate love one which we will never forget we were brave enough to turn the lamp on during the day to our surprise we saw the ghost if you stand at the end of the bed and look out you will see it during the day
195781 lets see the bloggers try and make sense of this tomorrow
195782 i look forward to any and all future clubhouse fistfights
195783 okay we were just kidding we offer washburn and ibanez for two tickets to the jonas brothers
195784 we handed out name tags and will be holding an ice cream social this weekend
195785 i expected to be a met today but apparently their prospects dont equal my sheer buttload of awesome
195786 itll be nice to be in a place where there are lots of people my own age
195787 if were supposed to be the pirates how come every other team rapes pillages and robs us freakin blind
195788 yeah maybe we lost one of the best hitters ever to play the game
195789 if were supposed to be the pirates how come every other team rapes pillages and robs us freakin blind
195790 no no dont shoot me from that angle it makes my nose look big

195793 nocera immerses an indium tin oxide electrode in water mixed with cobalt and potassium phosphate
195794 currently available electrolyzers which split water with electricity and are often used industrially are not suited for artificial photosynthesis because they are very expensive and require a highly basic non benign environment that has little to do with the conditions under which photosynthesis operates
195795 it was my bday saturday and you made me work you owe me one
195796 calling for early elections and tabling one no confidence motion after another seems to be the oppositions only way to come to power by trying to destabilise the country
195797 were kind of on a break i think its the only choice really
195798 otherwise it would be especially hard especially if shes going to do international dates too
195799 at the height of the story we had maybe six or eight guys on it britney round the clock
195800 i cannot say that i was a boxer with a distinct talent but thanks to my hard work and persistence i became a fighter who people began to notice and respect
195801 i did not have the means to turn boxing into my profession but at the same time i really wanted to have something to fall back on some form of art
195802 not many people would sacrifice their youth in the name of an idea
195803 for boris weekends simply did not exist there were many times when i would have liked to go to the cinema to do something fun but no he had to continue with his training
195804 i was careful not to hurt my partner for no reason i sort of ballet danced around the ring
195805 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
195806 not only did we play the race card we dealt it from the bottom of the deck
195807 although i seem to tolerate introspection better the older i am there are still too many claims on my attention to permit more than the briefest excursions down the path of self awareness when i am no longer busy with politics and with my own ambitions i hope to have more time to examine what i have done and failed to do with my career and why
195808 to prove to myself that i was the man i had always wanted to be
195809 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
195810 sen mccain believes this is so important that we do not politicize this debate during an election season
195811 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
195812 wants to raise your taxes to pay for bigger government
195813 in any negotiation that i might have when i go in my position will be that i am opposed to raising taxes
195814 but we have to work together to save social security
195815 hes too new and he needs to put some meat on his bones
195816 theres no question the challenging u s macro environment has hindered our ability to increase revenues
195817 despite this progress and strong growth in international geographies slowing performance in the u s impacted top line revenue growth
195818 ive always thought a successful manager has to be creative
195819 im extremely lucky to work in a place that is artistic by definition and that brings me extreme pleasure to me theatre is a way of life
195820 i dare to be proud because in only two years our management team without any of us being a genius succeeded in providing enough money for the completion of some projects
195821 progress comes when there is relatively smart and respectable governance as well as a long term dream on the horizon
195822 i think that a developed society or community is defined by abidance to a set of rules applicable to everyone in that respect theatre cannot be separated from society
195823 art above all is a way of self expression by any definition theatre is a collective effort but it comprises personal truths valid for each of the individuals involved in the creative process
195824 if a director succeeds in making people laugh or cry his or her mission has been fulfilled this is where the power of the theatre lies within human interactions and shared human emotions
195825 organisation punctuality synchronising and creativity is what comes to mind when i think of petar
195826 it is even harder when one has to deal with sensitive creative people and i do not mean only the actors
195827 everyone in our team is here out of love for the art of theatre it is this contagious collective energy that in some inexplicable way captures the audience as well
195828 as a director he is always prepared has a precise rehearsal schedule so if he decides to improvise he could step on solid foundations i think hes best in his manager role though he is something of a fakir who would not sleep for days until he makes sure that everything falls into the right place
195829 i want to have a real queen on the stage
195830 shakespeare is never too much for more than 400 years hes been the ultimate hit in all theatre
195831 once in a while i leaf through some of the plays to remind myself of his genius and the exercise makes me feel really humble
195832 but theatre is still alive because it bears a different spirit it has the means to tell a story by engaging human beings in the exchange of energy and emotions coming to and from the stage and i think people need this
195833 well even if i say yes to that kind of an offer there will be times when one night i would wander into a theatre to see whats on stage i know within a matter of minutes that specific stage dust will enter my nostrils the salary is not important if your job makes you miserable i am lucky to practise my passion and i believe that keeps me alive
195834 we dont expect a lot in the u s even in the second half of the year
195835 when youve got a 100 million customer that is not going to be growing its it purchases but instead take it down 30 percent thats a lot of customer acquisition to make up
195836 theres no question the challenging u s macro environment has hindered our ability to grow the top line and weve got a greater share of our business in the u s than many of our peers
195837 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
195838 when we are able to give out any pertinent information we will certainly let the public and the media know
195839 we dont expect a lot in the u s even in the second half of the year
195840 when youve got a 100 million customer that is not going to be growing its it purchases but instead take it down 30 percent thats a lot of customer acquisition to make up

195845 the muslim public affairs council should apologize for the statements of its executive director on september 11 2001
195846 i think one of the greatest fears of people in the united states is somebody may call you a racist they may call you an islamophobe
195847 and what weve seen with some of these organizations is their message is clear give us money or well call you an islamophobe
195848 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
195849 dal mio ufficio di pechino oggi posso accedere al sito internet di amnesty international e unesperienza che d quasi le vertigini un tuffo nella libert a cui non ero abituato da quando vivo qui

195851 the medicare bill and the schip measure are very different pieces of legislation
195852 they are both high profile election year health care bills
195853 there could be a few vote changers among the republicans who are getting nervous about their re election chances
195854 this is not to suggest there arent valid criticisms of the schip legislation but the reality is that it is a politically popular bill

195857 if congress determines that additional resources above the presidents request are needed congress must provide reductions in other appropriations bills to offset this increase and meet the presidents top line discretionary spending cap of 991 6 billion
195858 if congress does not offset this increase with spending reductions in other bills the president will veto any of the other bills that exceed his request until congress demonstrates a path to reach the presidents top line
195859 provides ample resources to ensure veterans receive the quality care they deserve
195860 i do not understand the values that would suggest during a time of war we provide tax breaks for people making over 1 million a year but we cannot afford to provide the health care our veterans deserve and the housing our troops need i believe our veterans military families and the american family will be as offended by this veto threat as i am
195861 this congress is dedicated to meeting the needs of our nations veterans no matter the political maneuvering of a callous president
195862 welcomes the provision in this bill that calls for a scientific review of menthol in cigarettes

195870 there is concern that al qaida will cooperate with extremist elements in the region such as hizbullah and hamas
195871 it arose in the discussion that global jihad organizations led by al qaida pose significant threats to the state of israel to israeli citizens and to jews around the world
195872 hamas wants to show that the alternative to its regime is al qaida and that additional pressure by israel or the international community will only ensure a taliban style regime in gaza
195873 and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together

195875 we are are witnessing a paradigmatic change in the middle east in which radical countries and elements are trying to install a new order to replace the traditional national secular one that exists today
195876 at the center of this radical axis is iran who seeks to achieve its regional aspiration of hegemony by upsetting the existing balance of power i believe it is therefore crucial that we block iranian aggression which would in turn weaken the radicalization process in the region presently being manifested in such places as iraq afghanistan lebanon and in the palestinian territories
195877 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam

195882 as far as the mortgage crisis in the us is concerned there is clearly an influence in all countries leading to a slowdown in real estate sales especially in the coming months
195883 the reduction of activity in the real estate market could be a sign that those prices have reached their highest segment level and the growth rates from 2007 and the first months of 2008 may not be matched again

195906 the poor performance coincided with the falls in stock prices around the world and the negative developments in the credit sector sellers were particularly active in january and march
195907 this multiple is somewhat distorted by the different stake of revaluation revenues in reits net income
195908 there are substantial differences in the accounting policies of bulgarian reits regarding revaluation of properties which makes comparisons of book values very difficult for example companies that have agricultural land security have extremely high revaluations while the investment assets of holiday apartments owned by fairplay properties reit are accounted at cost until the properties are actually sold
195909 prices of european real estate companies showed much higher volatility and their prices fell significantly for the quarter they were hit by the downtrend on the spanish housing market the liquidity crisis and the dwindling yields in central and eastern europe

195919 unlike most of you i have been to ethiopia like most of you i have stumped up the loot to charities to stop starvation there the wide eyed boy child we saved 20 years or so ago is now a priapic kalashnikov bearing hearty siring children whenever the whim takes him there is no doubt a good argument why we should prolong this predatory and dysfunctional economic social and sexual system but i do not know what it is there is on the other hand every reason not to write a column like this

195931 he was a highly cultured man he was very tolerant he had a sense of humour he was very positive he was very intellectual so he was a great person

195937 we are asking that the constitution be upheld and that the people conduct the election in a democracy it is the people that elect
195938 these disqualified candidates because they have economic propagandistic and media resources are denouncing us in international bodies
195939 the first thing that they need to recognize is that when the citizen power law which governs the comptroller general and the corruption law were passed all of these opposition representatives were present in the national assembly and were the first to cry for a strong hand in the fight against corruption
195940 violate or contravene in some way what is established in article 23 of the inter american convention on human rights or the pact of san jos

195943 without judging he basic question of the disqualification the commission observes that the lack of an opportune resolution of the case may imply that the case becomes inoperative or meaningless
195944 as que yo les hago un llamado a los se ores due os para que vengan por aqu y empecemos a negociar

195951 speaks of the level of the figure of the pope today in the world how is it possible to be absent from where he is what if something happens or he does something unscheduled
195952 the presence of the journalists in these two weeks at tranquil bressanone is one more proof of the anticipation for everything that the pope does or says an anticipation that doesnt end even when the situation brings discouragement
195953 there is little to spy on from the other side of the wall of the black canvas they have put up to protect benedicts walks in the garden of the seminary but we are prepared for whatever could be necessary

195955 the fact that the coalition has found the strength to conduct a fair self analysis to find the most adequate principles and mechanisms to correct the policy regarding first and foremost the european funds shows that the tripartite coalition has serious political resources and capacity

195979 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
195980 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
195981 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
195982 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
195983 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
195984 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
195985 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
195986 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
195987 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
195988 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
195989 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

196027 as president and founder of the abstinence clearinghouse judith reisman has affected my life personally through the enormous amount of scientific research shes done and without judiths impact on my life i dont believe the abstinence community would have been impacted
196028 kinsey is very responsible for the destruction of my parents generation
196029 i think judith reisman is starting to have an impact with people in the abstinence community because ive pushed to have her at our conferences and they just love her
196030 i felt safe with neighbors uncles or cousins as was the custom of that time
196031 i married and the hedge of protection about my life was not breached until 1966 when my 10 year old daughter was molested by a 13 year old adored and trusted family friend
196032 he knew she would like it he said he knew from his fathers magazines
196033 but as a young mother i had entered the world according to kinsey
196034 i would have to speed up my tempo to compete with the fast action and the increasing violence of the cartoons on other stations i found myself unwilling or unable to write for children that way
196035 in playboy penthouse would cause sexual acting out on children
196036 now i finally knew there was a source authority for children increasingly being viewed sexually

196058 so you can see that these terrorist groups are not that capable of instigating massive sabotage activities as some hostile forces hope to see
196059 to the beijing olympic games the biggest threat comes from the east turkistan terrorist organization

196092 this wont be funded with a dime of taxpayer money
196093 in my view organisations such as the caribbean farmers network cafan have to become familiar with the provisions in the epa such as the development support agreement as well as identifying niche markets which can be targeted under the terms of the epa
196094 agriculture has benefited the most from the agreement as 75 per cent of agricultural products imported from the eu faces tariffs
196095 this is the best agreement we could have had given the time available
196096 are there areas that we do not feel comfortable with of course are there areas which the eu are not comfortable with yes but if you think not signing the epa is better for us you are fooling yourself because the great wto forced us and we are committed to the rules

196128 rajshri thakur requested to be eased out of the competition as her knee was in real bad shape she had been advised by her doctors not to dance for a while bearing in mind her serial and personal commitments the actress did not want to take the risk of continuing
196129 rajshri had taken the decision to quit even before the episode shoot and had also informed the channel authorities but this decision came as a shocker to the judges and contestants present there
196130 the judges initially decided to go for a face off between raja hassan and amit paul but the major question before them was who will partner amit even if he survives this round however amit made things simpler as by saying he respects rajshris decision and will also opt out
196131 its a ligament tear that forced me to quit i had this problem ever since the show started but had ignored it
196132 i think all know the format of the show and they are also aware that i have earned my audience fans over a period of time due to my hard work nothing comes on a platter so if i am getting votes and my fans are supporting me then nobody should be unhappy after all it is a celebrity competition and everyone should respect audience voting as far as talent goes i have been performing to the fullest of my abilities and it was my hard work that was getting paid off my fans accepted me because of my talent

196137 if he moves itll be to a big club of course there are four or five clubs interested
196138 we are waiting for etoo if we receive a big offer for him then we can study that option

196141 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
196142 as hedging unwinds within the industry airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to we are not reflecting the spot price of oil today what is reflected in our fares is the oil price net of hedging
196143 we are honest and realistic about this in a way that a lot of airlines are not we have asked ourselves the question of what does the industry look like at 150 per barrel and what do we do to be one of the airlines that succeeds in that environment we dont just want to hang in there
196144 we are not talking about grounding aircraft but the average utilisation will come down slightly
196145 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
196146 its fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs
196147 it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august so there is still plenty of time to run
196148 with regards to diego i was amazed as everybody else to read it in newspapers this morning i think that is just pure speculation

196151 nuclear bomb testing that started in the late 1950s significantly contaminated the whole of the atmosphere so you have very high levels of carbon 14 through that period that didnt exist prior to that
196152 when were going back in time you dont have that effect its really the natural radiocarbon youre using to get the measurements from
196153 a plant takes up the c14 an animal eats the plant the animal looks as though it has a lower c14 activity for a living organism than it should do
196154 it dies you measure it it looks as though it died some time ago when in fact it only just died
196155 a probability the person had died in 1650 but also a smaller probability they had died in 1960
196156 its unlikely that carbon dating will be able to shed much light on the dates of these individuals
196157 what it could do is rule out a prehistoric origin for example if this was an old burial site of 200 years ago or beyond that carbon dating could tell you that what it couldnt tell you to within a few years is when that individual died
196158 the context of where they found the human material and the buildings around them and the strata in which they were found will typically give them more information than a carbon date would
196159 we have the evidence that the bones were placed where we found them no earlier than the late 60s early 70s we have the evidence that they were burned
196160 we have the evidence they were deliberately concealed and we seem to have evidence we think that they were moved from one part of the building to another
196161 we are following our plan of preparations for the premier league season
196162 im really glad that i have a chance to test my team against serious opponents ahead of the its start
196163 we came here to prepare the best possible way for the season opening match with portsmouth its my dominating idea for the moment
196164 we played three good games in china but those were not strong games here we will face much more strong opponents
196165 we will start against the hosts lokomotiv and then will face either milan or sevilla its very useful experience now im already sure about 85 percent of my first line up i hope after this tournament ill be completely sure about it
196166 the feedback i received from the teams that competed last year was that the organisation was excellent and the teams participating were of a very high standard
196167 so when we got asked to participate it didnt take long to say yes
196168 there is no question that any deal will be done with regards to didier
196169 i said i will change the way i speak to the players because they are one year older and are more conscious of what they have to do i hope this season will be the good one
196170 i know some english players did criticise me after the game with birmingham trying to make of me responsible for this defeat in truth a draw i thought they exaggerated
196171 the only thing i can say is that we could have won there and when you want to be champion you have to keep in mind that those games make the difference

196181 this is great news for local government workers particularly our colleagues on the lower pay scales
196182 in the economic climate foregoing two days pay is a big ask and i am glad that the scale of the industrial action across the country has brought the employers back to the negotiating table
196183 local government workers are often caring for the most vulnerable members of our society it is only right that they get a fair pay deal
196184 along with other members i am taking industrial action because in the current economic climate this paltry offer on pay hits those on the lower bands hardest
196185 inflation is currently around 4 food prices are up 9 energy bills are up 15 and petrol is up 22
196186 local government workers provide essential services often to the most vulnerable in our society and they deserve a pay deal that at least keeps track with inflation
196187 our mp has spent his time recently blocking reforms to mps expenses but he did not take up my invitation to back local government workers and come to the picket line this morning im afraid thats new labour for you all mouth and no trousers

196233 wonder why the smoking hot 3g apple iphone only costs 199 less than half the price of the original heres a two word hint randall stephenson
196234 stephenson who became at amp ts chairman and ceo a year ago championed the idea of paying apple about 300 per device analysts estimate to help hold down the retail cost
196235 it remains to be seen if at amp ts gamble will pay off one thing is clear thanks to the iphone the smartphone game has changed dramatically and so have consumer perceptions of the mobile web a netherworld that seemed downright hostile before the iphone showed up
196236 at amp ts role in the iphones success could cement its place as the premier cellphone carrier in the usa
196237 the iphone has a huge impact on carriers which tried for years to sell consumers on the idea of wireless data says charles golvin a senior wireless analyst at forrester then apple came along and in a 30 second commercial they just made it dead simple he says that simplicity married to the sleek iphone design and web friendly function has energized consumers he says its also raised the bar globally for carriers and established handset makers he adds
196238 youll get no argument from stephenson in a sit down interview he says the iphone is central to what he sees as an ongoing transformation of at amp t his goal turn the iconic company into a wireless goliath with global reach and intense customer loyalty
196239 the iphone has repositioned at amp t as the premier wireless brand in the world stephenson says
196240 in 2005 stephenson was quick to lend his support to an idea first raised by cingular ceo stan sigman to pursue a handset deal with apple
196241 other telecoms including verizon passed because apple was demanding control of marketing pricing and more at amp t didnt blink however and the iphone partnership was born
196242 the iphone might seem like a no brainer now but back then it was little more than a concept with no name design plan or software operating system and it was offered by a computer company that had zip experience in wireless
196243 but the idea did have one thing going for it apple ceo steve jobs
196244 were not betting on the handset he says reflecting on that fateful 2005 decision to lock arms with apple
196245 at amp t s role in the iphones success could cement its place as the premier cellphone carrier in the usa

196257 il desiderio del signor holbrooke di vedere la mia scomparsa se possibile prima che io riveli questa ed altre verita e ancora piu valida e piu forte oggi e le azioni tese a raggiungere questo obiettivo sono messe in atto senza risparmi di sforzi
196258 mentre questi tentativi continuano e con questa minaccia alla mia vita io devo sedermi in un posto che lui e i suoi amici conoscono non ci possono essere regolarita in tutto questo aggiunge karadzic che ha deciso di difendersi da solo perche io non so quanto lungo e il braccio di holbrooke o della signora albright oppure di qualcun altro del loro team o se questo braccio mi puo raggiungere fin qui

196384 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations

196390 arsenal in the community has been linked to social inclusion long before the term existed in the context we now understand it in the late 1980s we managed a government initiative named action sport which was established to address the escalation of youth unrest and unemployment sport and the attraction of arsenal football club was used as a hook to attract unemployed people and provide them with qualifications and pathways into employment ever since then much of our work has its roots firmly embedded in the notion of using sport as a way to address social issues in those days it was unemployment sport for disabled people and female participation today with our 25th anniversary in sight the focus is on anti social behaviour crime and education among other things
196391 for our positive futures and kickz programmes sport is not the main priority we are more concerned with the opportunities that this engagement presents if players on our estates football programme are smoking beside the pitch between matches or they show up drinking alcohol we see it as an opportunity to strike up conversations about smoking and drinking with one group of youngsters we became concerned about their lack of understanding around the reclassification of cannabis they clearly thought it had become legal rather than reclassified they were not responding to advice at the sessions so we decided to take them away on a residential trip packed with sport and physical activity the real aim of the trip was to provide them with facts about the cannabis law we wanted to let them know that it was still an illegal drug so they could make an informed choice the trip was great football basketball fitness and healthy exercise but most importantly they came away knowing the law surrounding cannabis its since been reclassified back to a class b drug
196392 the very nature of this type of work is challenging and we often have to judge success in small measures for some young people we try to engage its a bonus if we get a hello out of them its the consistency of engagement thats important access to activities and interaction with staff they trust on a regular basis is key to the approach its often temporary shelter because when some leave the project in the evening they are still faced with the pressures in their lives but we hope they realise there is someone they can turn to if they need to its rewarding when we see young people grow up with a project and even more so when they gain some accreditation and qualifications or even employment with us on the other hand its hard when we see young people get themselves into trouble with police drugs or involved in knife crime we are realistic and know there are many challenges facing young people as they grow up in the inner cities and it concerns us to hear some say that they dont like travelling too far away from where they live but its also comforting for example to be able to provide a safe environment for them to play football and take them to another part of the borough to play against another arsenal in the community project

196415 aided and abetted by the actions of tom cruise his right hand man for foreign and domestic promotion as well as for foreign and domestic lobbying he has assisted the syndicate in acquiring funds and made his own donations of money believed to be in the multiple tens of millions of dollars
196416 earlier this month the federal court of appeals for the 11th circuit already rejected similar claims and affirmed that the churchs use of the book in question was fair use mr letterese was penalized 266 000 by a california court for refusing to provide evidence to support many of the same allegations

196436 its a privilege to receive the support and encouragement from judge schuette given the distinguished and proud record of service that schuette has given our state michigan needs a tough judge to follow in his footsteps as a judge bill schuette exemplified the proper role of the judiciary to strictly interrupt the laws of our land not make them schuette has given so much to michigan in his twenty two years of public service michigan families are thankful i am humbled by schuettes endorsement along with the support of so many as the campaign for the 4th court of appeals continues
196437 this is a struggle for the hearts of the people and good governance and the creation of afghan security forces
196438 this is a generational war to build an afghan state and prevent the creation of a lawless extremist region which will host and sustain enduring threats to the vital national security interests of the united states and our key allies
196439 and then any excess produce they get to take home
196440 and we will also donate any excess to the salvation army food pantry here in kirksville

196442 this is the message that continuously comes back to me when reading the many many wonderful bloggers out there no matter what your situation odds are someone who has a blog has experienced or is now experiencing that same thing we are all connected in some way
196443 i am disappointed that talks between british energy and edf have not yet been successful
196444 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and the government is a minority shareholder in a publicly listed company it is a now matter for both boards to see how to proceed
196445 our commitment to nuclear power is clear and nuclear new build does not depend on one single deal be still has potential sites and sites are available from the nuclear decommissioning authority
196446 the level of interest in nuclear new build in the uk from edf and from other operators remains high
196447 we owe a debt of gratitude to those who fought for the first state pension today the challenges are very different from 1908 when just one in four survived to collect the first state pension in contrast one in four babies born today will go on to live to 100
196448 the impact of this is stark current trends suggest the uk will have its first 120 year old in the early 2060s if not before that means she is already drawing her state pension and will do so for half her lifetime
196449 we have a responsibility to look after todays pensioners whilst also being custodians of the state pension for future generations and that means putting in place a system that can cope with a rapidly ageing population and high expectations for retirement whilst remaining affordable
196450 the state pension is now in good shape for the generations to come and people can be reassured it will continue to form the bedrock of pension provision for another 100 years
196451 pensioners especially are feeling the affect of price rises in their heating bills and at the supermarket
196452 for example from october we will be making it simpler and more automatic to claim pension credit housing benefit and council tax benefit in one call
196453 his mr labeoufs two fingers are pretty mashed but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
196454 the faculty members are outstanding professionals and have been highly successful in raising significant major gifts for capital campaigns for health care institutions and causes
196455 people who suffer from illnesses such as heart disease gastrointestinal infections and pancreatic disease will really benefit from these new nihr biomedical research units
196456 the new funding will enable high quality research to flourish in these small but excellent research groups and will strengthen our drive to put the uk at the forefront of vital health research as well as enhancing the nations international reputation as a centre for excellence
196457 this new investment underlines the governments commitment to delivering major improvements in the north east
196458 the metro is an iconic system with a vital role to play for people travelling in and around tyne and wear almost 300 million will be spent to upgrade this service and ensure smoother running trains better stations better services and better provision of information to customers
196459 i am also pleased that we are able to support sunderlands proposal to create a crucial new crossing over the river wear with nearly 98 million in government funding this will create a much needed new gateway into the city centre alleviate the congestion currently experienced at crossing points and make a major contribution to regeneration along the river corridor

196462 government has failed to generate a real dialogue on practical issues that have meaning for the general public the way in which the bill has been drafted has stifled debate and has prevented parliament from considering the balance of power between central and local government as well as how power might be devolved it is time to be bolder and to widen the terms of reference of the constitutional renewal bill
196463 this policy statement pulls together in one single place the comprehensive and wide ranging policy actions ofwat is taking to ensure the sector is responding to the challenges of climate change
196464 this is a long term issue changing weather patterns are guaranteed for decades to come and the sector must adapt to cope with that while at the same time taking responsibility for its emissions and playing an appropriate part in reducing the amount of greenhouse gases produced in the uk
196465 the progress made over the past few weeks demonstrates the willingness of the promoters to react to the expert advice they have been given but there are no done deals and only the best quality schemes with very high sustainability standards will qualify for eco town status
196466 many of the proposals have shown significant and encouraging progress during those few weeks in all cases the panel made suggestions about where it believes further progress is most needed and has encouraged the direction in which much of the work is going it is now for the proposers to consider whether and how to respond to these comments through the further development of their ideas
196467 environmental permits are an essential tool in protecting the environment from the impacts of waste but the system must be fair simple and proportionate to risk the changes we are proposing in the consultation we have published today deliver all those things our estimate is that they will also offer real savings for some businesses by cutting red tape and making waste management more efficient which could be as much as 45m over three years
196468 these proposed revised exemptions will complete the new environmental permitting regime and ensure that the level of regulation of waste activities match the risk they pose to the environment this consultation is an opportunity for industry to help shape the new exemptions system
196469 most of the waste exemptions currently available have been in place since 1994 with little or no amendment to keep pace with the changing world of waste management and the new techniques that have been developed we need a revised suite of exemptions
196470 we are seeking to encourage businesses to recover and recycle their waste by offering exemptions for truly low risk operations conversely we are proposing tightening the regulations for those operations that pose a higher risk to the environment
196471 we need to hear the views of businesses which might be affected before we make changes to the system we would encourage all businesses handling waste to look at the website to find out if their waste activity might be affected and to participate in the consultation
196472 blythe has a deep commitment to improving the lives of others and serving the philanthropic community

196496 when i started thinking about how much time the movies were taking i thought can i actually do a music career
196497 and i thought i dont wanna put myself up to that and the film work seems to be going just fine and i can love music and just be where im at
196498 but my wife said why dont you do this music seems to make you very happy she kind of was a great partner in the whole thing and every four months she would revisit that because i think deep down she knew how much i loved it
196499 when i started playing with the first three guys for as good as they were i didnt feel really comfortable and i stopped after about two months and then i didnt do anything
196500 and chris looked at me and she goes what are you gonna do and i said i dunno maybe im not gonna do it and she said why
196501 thats when i called johnny and we started writing songs and i said look i dont know where this is gonna go but i just wanna start writing music again and start playing and it just evolved
196502 i dont know if ive done the right thing at the end of the day or not
196503 i think if people have manners then its going to be an exceptional night
196504 i think if people really want to engage in really good discourse i think itll be a really exceptional night
196505 and i think if anybody wants to go to a place that would be awkward for either myself or them itll be a mistake
196506 rachel is such a beautiful and brilliant ingenue in those previous two films and i knew i could never fill her shoes

196511 its been seven years since the second mummy film so it gives you liberty to have the roles recast

196513 we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
196514 yea war go team go freedom go kill all the dirty rotten bastards
196515 we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
196516 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies

196525 youll have to use your imagination because many of the places ill be mentioning on this tour are not there anymore
196526 because tubman herself was considered a runaway slave and there was a 40 000 reward for her capture so she likely worked in the kitchen or laundry here under an assumed name
196527 there was such a rich culture here and so much has been lost
196528 and at the end of the day it was completely drained and cleaned
196529 i remember that in the late 1950s when i was in fifth grade you were told to get off if you went to other beaches
196530 i would venture to say a lot of white people are not aware that there ever were black people in ocean city
196531 the younger generation probably doesnt even know what were talking about
196532 but we knew missouri avenue was our beach and we were not to go beyond there

196544 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
196545 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
196546 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
196547 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
196548 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
196549 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
196550 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
196551 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
196552 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
196553 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
196554 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
196555 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
196556 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen

196580 for the show it was kind of like this is whats best for us because you know there was a personal investment in it and we love the show and were happy to be on it but it was kinda like were moving to la we hope you guys are happy doing a third season following us and oxygen was on board

196582 i cant understand it but obviously people think wow i relate to you youre normal
196583 when we decided to do a reality show we said that this is our lives were putting it out there and when we put it out there we put it all out there its really dedicated to putting the truth out there about our relationship we didnt want anything set up just follow us and people will either like us or they wont and theres been a great response
196584 yeah i feel you can tell when that happens and you notice it
196585 i have a deal with 90210 ive had it for a while theyve been really kind
196586 so they were kind enough to give me a little bit of time off im definitely coming back later in the season
196587 i wanted to come back on this show for my fans the fans were dedicated and loyal and i thought we owed it to them for the original cast to come back i think its amazing the more cast members they can get from the original series the more people are just psyched they have jennie garth they have shannen
196588 the shannen get was huge for the fans because shes the original shes brenda walsh
196589 the systematic use of terror especially as a means of coercion
196590 they will take that intense personal feeling of emasculation and failure and find some societal or political overlay that makes the failure seem not of their doing

196637 hamlet has been a play that ive always been very passionate about
196638 ever since ive been preparing for the festival like crazy and have finally finished the opera

196653 commissions cannot become avenues of harassment in which complaints are simultaneously made in several jurisdictions the remedy is to introduce rules that will allow for one jurisdiction only
196654 commissions do not operate in a vacuum and must have an understanding of the geo political context within which they operate
196655 costs must be levied against those whose clear aim is to abuse the system by launching attacks designed to harass bona fide respondents this would be a deterrent against those who deliberately seek to hijack and corrupt the human rights system in pursuit of their own ideological bent
196656 commissions do not operate in a vacuum and must have an understanding of the geo political context within which they operate the remedy for ignorance is education and training investigators must be required to undertake compulsory in house courses that meet these needs

196684 vdi staat nog in de kinderschoenen en is zeker nog in ontwikkeling sinds kort zijn twee grote namen in de virtualisatiewereld vmware en citrix ingestapt in vdi met deze toetreding zal er in ieder geval een versnelling komen in de r evolutie van het product vdi de virtualisatie van het werkstation zou nog een stap verder kunnen door het te verplaatsen naar de hardware van het werkstation zelf hiermee bedoel ik de virtualisatie van de lokale hardware met een synchronisatie naar het datacenter indien de mogelijkheid zich voordoet hiermee komt er ook een mogelijkheid voor laptops om gebruik te maken van de voordelen van vdi er is nog een lange weg te gaan maar ik ben ervan overtuigd dat met vdi een eerste stap is gezet naar een flexibele en dynamische werkstationinfrastructuur
196685 virtualisatie op de desktop is een volgende stap in de virtualisatiemarkt de vraag is of iedereen hier al aan toe is op dit moment is iedereen zich aan het richten op de virtualisatie van de servers enerzijds omdat de servers steeds krachtiger worden anderzijds vanwege milieuredenen zal de vdi techniek echt doordringen tot de desktop voorwaarde is denk ik dat de applicatie geschikt is om hiermee om te gaan de huidige technieken citrix en rdp hebben voor een aantal applicaties beperkingen waardoor ze eigenlijk niet gebruikt worden indien deze beperkingen uit de weg worden genomen is er zeker een kans van slagen verschillende bedrijven zijn inmiddels betrokken bij de ontwikkeling van vdi vooral voor het versnellen en beperken van het verkeer
196686 ik denk dat er twee verschillende technologie n op een hoop worden gegooid aan de ene kant de nieuwe incarnatie van de domme terminal aan de andere kant het gebruik van virtualisatie voor de dekstop het ene is prima zonder het andere te gebruiken een terminal in combinatie met een broker en windows server levert minder problemen op dan de hier beschreven oplossing wat ook niet vergeten moet worden is dat met vdi de desktop effects en film een probleem vormen een terminal zonder geavanceerde grafische weergave doet gemiddeld 100 kb per seconde piekbelastingen boven de 1 mb per seconde zijn normaal printen maar bijvoorbeeld ook usb sticks vormen een uitdaging printopdrachten van 100 mb zijn niet ongewoon maar wel lastig als je in een pand zit dat bijvoorbeeld met een sdsl verbinding aan het centrale netwerk hangt ik denk wel dat deze technologie de toekomst heeft maar hij is zeker nog niet uitontwikkeld
196687 hoewel het steeds meer komt is vdi nog niet doorgebroken hoewel hiermee een goede stap gezet kan worden in de richting van working anywhere zie ik bedrijven het niet snel doen omdat het een grote investering is vdi biedt een ge soleerd systeem waarbij je er dus voor zou kunnen kiezen om de eindgebruiker alles op zijn eigen desktop te laten instaleren zonder dat anderen er last van hebben de vraag is dan of het niet een andere vorm van beheer vereist want ten opzichte van het reguliere beheer geeft het een grotere vorm van centralisatie van systemen steeds meer en meer zal er remote gewerkt worden en steeds meer wordt de systeembeheerder verwijderd van het persoonlijke contact met de klant al met al ben ik een beetje in dubio vdi is in potentie een goed product of het slaagt ligt aan de manier waarop het toegepast gaat worden
196688 vdi is meer dan een hype ondanks dat het nog niet echt is doorgebroken de grote bedrijven als microsoft vmware en citrix leveren goede oplossingen en een speler als 2x levert een goede prijsbewuste oplossing die zeker de moeite waard is voor klanten levert het enerzijds een besparing op maar veel belangrijker het levert een continu beschikbare client op de client is bijna monkeyproof voor gebruikers levert het een heel flexibele omgeving op mits goed ge mplementeerd juist in de implementatiefase gaat het vaak mis onjuist ge mplementeerd wordt het al snel een bottleneck in je omgeving ik heb zelf de vdi training van vmware gehad en was erg verbaasd wat er allemaal nog bij komt kijken om het goed te doen voor de klant is het een goed concept waar zeker geld mee te besparen is maar zorg voor een goede implementatiedienstverlener
196689 vdi is zeker een groeimarkt voor komende tijd ik zie dat de interesse vanuit de markt er zeker is maar dat er te veel naar de kostenbesparende aspecten gekeken wordt ik denk dat dit een verkeerd uitgangspunt is om te kijken naar vdi en het zal zeker ook niet de doorslag geven om vdi te implementeren het is meer een oplossing die gaat samenwerken met de traditionele omgevingen en dus naast de bestaande infrastructuur zijn sterke punten zijn de voordelen van centraal beheer en het snel uitrollen van nieuwe werkplekken ik denk dat vdi een product is dat we de komende tijd veel gaan tegenkomen
196690 op dit moment is vdi als concept meer een tussenoplossing voor veel bedrijven zal het complementair zijn aan hun server based computing omgeving en niet per se concurrerend waar de meeste ict managers maar zeker ook de business managers van dromen is een homogene omgeving die off en online kan werken en daarmee overal beschikbaar is of beschikbaar gemaakt kan worden perfecte uniforme ontsluiting tot alle applicaties die de eindgebruiker nodig heeft tot die tijd moeten we het doen met de beschikbare infrastructuurproducten en die zijn zeker niet slecht er ontbreekt echter hier en daar nog wel voldoende integratie om acceptatie door het bedrijfsleven vanzelfsprekend te maken een implementatie van een virtuele desktop waarbij al deze producten ingezet worden moet ik echter nog tegenkomen kostentechnisch gezien is dat namelijk een slechte oplossing
196691 vdi wordt steeds vaker genoemd als oplossing en komt steeds vaker op de roadmap te staan de voordelen van vdi zijn onder andere security beter in staat compliant te zijn en een betere manageability ook zaken als een thuiswerkplek zijn makkelijker te realiseren en de migratie naar vdi is relatief eenvoudig om de kostenbesparingen te halen die vaak worden genoemd zijn er diverse randvoorwaarden het betekent dat de infrastructuur aan de juiste eisen moet voldoen qua bandbreedte storage en tooling het betekent dat de kwaliteit van beheer op een hoog niveau moet staan het vraagt om meer kennis dan standaardbeheer in sommige gevallen is een groot voorbereidend traject nodig voordat er kan worden begonnen met implementatie een goede architectuur is hierbij nodig de toekomst van vdi ziet er heel goed uit en zal binnenkort ook niet meer weg te denken zijn
196692 vdi is mijns inziens zeker geen hype sterker nog ik denk dat het op dit moment de enige manier is om de uitdagingen die alle bedrijven hebben op het gebied van beheer stroomverbruik ruimtegebrek in het datacenter koelingsproblemen etc op een effectieve manier te lijf te gaan belangrijk bij elke vdi oplossing is dat deze zo min mogelijk moet ingrijpen op de bestaande infrastructuur applicatie onafhankelijk moet zijn en naadloos met bestaande applicaties moet kunnen integreren het artikel refereert aan oplossingen van citrix en vmware op ons kantoor gebruiken wij al zon acht jaar de sunray als desktop en onze vdi oplossing wordt regelmatig ge mplementeerd bij klanten vdi heeft dus zeker een toekomst

196709 this acquisition provides us with an excellent opportunity to increase our customer base in a major market where kone already has a good presence

196712 i want to persuade and explain to north korea that it would be beneficial to the country to resolve the abduction issue early

196714 in working level talks with north korea in mid june we exchanged promises i will do my best to make sure we move from the stage of promise for promise to that of action for action
196715 in cooperation with the international community i will work to seek solutions to the issues of north koreas nuclear arms and programs abductions and missiles
196716 the fact that i was appointed as minister this time shows prime minister fukudas strong will to resolve the abduction issue and to bring the abductees home to japan
196717 for us at the foreign ministry nothing would be better than minister komura being retained
196718 he has the experience of having held the post before and has gained considerable recognition among his foreign counterparts
196719 the second quarter of 2008 proved to be a difficult environment for many financial institutions however our performance was mostly in line with anticipated results for the period
196720 our expansion into roanoke rapids north carolina continued with the opening of our fifth branch in april 2008 this location marks our second branch opened in north carolina within the past 18 months as a result this has and will place additional pressure on interim earnings but will create a stronger and more valuable franchise complementing expansion plans the bank continues to implement various financial and service related strategies designed to have a long term positive impact for our shareholders and customers

196730 under this agreement safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods as applied elsewhere in the world
196731 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
196732 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards

196759 whites stunning second crime novel to feature ex cop and ex pi jackson donne fulfills the promise of his debut
196760 intricate plotting and nonstop action make this a nail biting read from start to finish white is a writer to watch
196761 scenes of donnes mothers decline however are knowing and movingly written and the gritty new jersey locale seems an ideal setting for portraying the evil that men do
196762 white has learned early the art of the hard boiled
196763 white has created an appealing character in donne and the plot flies between the events in the 1940s and explosions kidnappings and murders in the present
196764 an engrossing evocative debut novel that will grab most readers from its opening sentences fans of hard hitting uncompromising private investigators will hope that donne ditches his college dreams and continues to pound the pavement
196765 white manages the neat trick of respecting the genres traditions while daring to nudge it toward something new and unexpected
196766 a unique and artful blend of the pi novel and the police procedural with a story as deceptively simple as your first love and as fatal as your last car wreck a terrific novel
196767 its the great american private eye novel reborn for the 21st century with a fast moving spare style that punches you in the gut at the same time it squeezes your heart
196768 when one man dies barrels straight out of the old school and swerves onto the highway that will take detective fiction where its going next dave white has one hand on the wheel the other on the gear shift and his foot on the floor
196769 fast and funny with plenty of classic action but a setting and character that are entirely new dave white is creating a winner with jackson donne
196770 when one man dies heralds the introduction of two astonishing new figures in the crime fiction world new jersey pi jackson donne whose emotional journey will break your heart and author dave white whose voice has the confidence and assurance many more established writers would kill for

196786 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
196787 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
196788 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
196789 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
196790 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
196791 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
196792 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
196793 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
196794 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
196795 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
196796 go to the edge of the cliff and jump off
196797 this was a vicious and unprovoked attack and it is only by sheer luck the victim wasnt permanently injured
196798 the ferocity of the blows to his head could have caused serious and lasting damage their actions were sickening to watch and were mindless violence at its worst
196799 this despicable and callous offence has heaped shame on rochdale
196800 fortunately incidents like this are few and far between and i hope that people realise that this is not the true face of rochdale
196801 it is only by the grace of god that the victim wasnt more seriously injured this behaviour sickened me
196802 this shows the importance of the councils cctv systems otherwise these people may never have been caught
196803 unfortunately rochdale has a pretty tarnished image what with roadworks depleted shopping facilities and the recent live news broadcasts from falinge so we want to put forward a more positive view of the borough
196804 we want to leave a legacy for rochdale and the idea is to show some of the positive things taking place
196805 he was the nicest lad in the world and enjoyed his football fishing and cricket
196806 he was a massive rochdale football fan and had just got his season ticket for the club for next year
196807 we used to take picnics to old trafford and watch lancashire in the twenty20 cricket he loved that too
196808 hed just started playing for a local cricket team and was a cracking fielder
196809 he was told time and time again not to do it but you cant put an old head on young shoulders and now he has paid the ultimate price
196810 a couple of years ago the bus route was axed because time and time again it couldnt get through
196811 it was thought that residents parking permits would be in place by the time the easter fair came round again but now that is not going to happen
196812 i am angry and frustrated because i was told it was going ahead and i passed that on to residents it is absolute bedlam and it is making the lives of people who live there a misery
196813 hollingworth lake is called rochdales jewel in the crown and the council wants more people to visit yet it wont spend any money on this
196814 im the toughest man on earth and what are you going to do about it
196815 nos despertamos a primera hora de la ma ana para rezar
196816 las profesoras me dijeron que cerrase la puerta de la cocina nadie estaba asustado y de hecho las estudiantes volvieron a la cama despu s de que subiese al piso de arriba comenz a llegar un olor a gas de los dormitorios de abajo y en seguida se produjo una explosi n muy violenta
196817 estaba con cinco amigas en la parte que hab a quedado en pie del edificio sent amos muy cerca el fuego que ven a de la planta baja cuando abrimos la puerta vimos que la mitad del edificio se hab a derrumbado y que s lo nuestra parte se manten a en pie dos trozos de madera cayeron encima de mi empec a gritar pidiendo ayuda y me rescataron
196818 there is nowhere else for castree to go the judges have laughed at him we think this is the end of it the final chapter
196819 it is an almost inevitable fact that a spate of hot weather usually means we will find ourselves attending a tragic incident involving someone playing on or near water
196820 i know its tempting for people but it is all too easy for them to get into trouble if you fancy a dip then go to your local swimming pool its supervised and safe

196825 ive repeatedly visited the jammu amp kashmir valley in the last few years ill first tell what i didnt do i didnt meet the politicians in power in j amp k but ive met the army and heard their side of the sad story ive also met kashmiri pandits who have been languishing in refugee camps for years more of them die from snake bites than bullet wounds these things never get reported and what troubles the kashmiris most is misreporting by the mainstream media
196826 ive met members of the hurriyat and militant organisations in kashmir that i cant name i also met syed ali shah geelani and the tragic conclusion ive drawn is that the indian government hasnt really paid any attention to their anguish no indian filmmaker has done justice to the militants all the social and political organisations in kashmir feel that indian films based on kashmir are completely fake and one sided
196827 i dont want to make a film propagating the view of militancy i dont want to make a preachy film i just want to make a fair film i do want to put the local kashmiri viewpoint forward
196828 after parzania im no stranger to trouble it is important to do the work that you believe in however just because my first two films are about serious issues doesnt mean that i wont make a pure entertainer in the future
196829 the kashmiris have a legitimate reason to feel isolated from the indian mainstream every time ive visited the valley im asked aap hindustan se aaye hain at first it was an eerie feeling to be asked something like that gradually the truth sank in kashmir has swum too far away from the indian mainstream to be brought back
196830 tango what was the maximum ticket price in 1978 i was barely knowing the world then
196831 i still remember all the chaos his entry created just for a song in one of the dutt movies
196832 i never wore any padgi turban nor did i perform to the singh is kinng track
196833 tango what was the maximum ticket price in 1978 i was barely knowing the world then

196841 the yellow birds are found in the drier inland areas so the color of their plumage may have evolved to blend in with their habitat
196842 or the colors could have something to do with what female birds find attractive
196843 many evolutionary biologists have argued that the different forms of crimson rosellas arose or speciated through ring speciation
196844 we found that in the case of crimson rosellas their three separate genetic groups dont show a simple link to the geographical distribution of the color forms
196845 people think that somehow were weak and not able to express opinions
196846 gordon smith is my friend but the problem is that when its come time to vote in the senate hes been a much better friend of george bush
196847 voting with george bush 90 percent of the time just isnt good for the people and issues ive fought for over a lifetime
196848 its not personal its about whats best for our country the inescapable fact is that electing jeff merkley is the only way we can win a senate majority that gets things done for people again
196849 gordon smiths problem is that he rarely breaks away from george bush and the republican agenda that i think has done this country great damage
196850 an essential preparatory step in the plan to bring death and destruction to the heart of the uk
196851 ive been coming around to the opinion that bloggers are just journalists
196852 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
196853 the section that deals with this is called the devil is in the details this is a really unfortunate choice of words
196854 basescu si tariceanu au in interiorul lor ceva impotriva tiganetului dar nu o recunosc
196855 all of this points away from the direction of higher prices clearly elements other than supply and demand fundamentals are at play
196856 i believe those in office and those running for office should not be afraid of an anonymous attack
196857 the public is smart enough to judge who is making the attack and if they dont know who is making the attack the public usually discounts anonymous attacks
196858 whatever you do in a political campaign you need to have the courage to take responsibility for it
196859 anybody who is trying to influence an election ought to be prepared to stand before the voters of the state and let them know they are trying to influence an election
196860 people should be allowed to anonymously complain about their government
196861 by masquerading as a neutral group you can send a message that is actually from a candidate
196862 its just one more way to make it more difficult to know where the money is coming from and who is paying for the message
196863 im not trying to replace anybody which i think is how a lot of people are going to look at it im not trying to be manny ram rez lets be honest hes one of the best players in the game im not going to hit 50 homers i like to say i do a handful of things that are going to stand out i try to be solid first and foremost im just trying to be me
196864 a candidate that would help john mccain win new york would probably be a resurrection
196865 id like to kiss miley cyrus at the teen choice awards maybe well have another britney madonna moment on stage how hilarious would that be although i dont think it would help her career however it would definitely help mine
196866 she sang on my record so i think shes kind of getting back at me because she was doing harmonies and backgrounds
196867 6 weeks in a row at number one and miley recorded two of my old songs
196868 when is the appropriate time to wear a fur stole
196869 im shocked that the mayor and council would so blatantly attempt to insert politics into a matter thats under consideration by the supreme court of this state
196870 the law says that it had to be corrected whether thats now or next week
196871 it just occurred to city staff hey weve got a conflict here
196872 this is an obvious attempt by the mayor to change the rules that this election was held under that he signed himself after the election
196873 i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
196874 making these people suffer isnt going to pass the budget any sooner
196875 but we really dont know whats going to happen yet
196876 this to me is the biggest political stunt the governor has ever pulled and hes not even filming a movie
196877 its harming and blaming the workers of california for the failure of the administration a california state department of motor vehicles employee turns away customers at the west covina dmv as they close down early because of budget reductions july 31 2008 many state employees face possible layoffs and wage cuts because of the governors state budget cuts correspondent photo by mike mullen to work together with the legislature
196878 i dont know if hes schwarzenegger got the legal authority
196879 cabinet secretaries have been working on which of the 22 000 employees will fall under the exemption
196880 since when do we start punishing state workers for something that is not their responsibility
196881 the governor should instead be threatening members of his own party who continue to obstruct the process of passing a budget
196882 theres 32 of us republican legislators who strongly believe we need a smaller government and less taxes
196883 democrats want to play robin hood at everyone elses expense
196884 it would take just two republicans in the senate and six in the assembly to agree on a compromise
196885 were in a difficult spot and we need to come up with a solution sooner than later
196886 hes getting peoples attention if this gets resolved in a couple of weeks there wont be any impact at all
196887 the reality is the governor is losing focus and is using politics as a method to coarse dialogue between two sides
196888 a meaningful discussion on core issues is the only way to deal with californias fiscal crisis not political maneuvering
196889 forcing public servants into financial hardship or unemployment will not fix our problems it will only exacerbate the situation
196890 the songs slogan like a double entendre translates into a so called friend that through drinking on their own accord shows their true personality for example a good friend that ends up being an asshole afte getting drunk at a party or bar the video will be shot on location at a bar the band fequents in sanborn ny called the walmore inn the video will feature a friend of the band whos had too much to drink before he even gets to the bar and proceeds to start shit with everyone throughout the song until the band has had enough and starts a bar fight the video has drinking fighting and some heavy as shit music to back it all up
196891 a much heavier album than sirens 2006 but keeping with that classic idt sound that we have all come to love
196892 were really pumped about this new record lividity is a medical term as i am a huge fan of csi that means when you die all your blood in your body settles so where youre lying is a bruise covering that part of your body metaphorically for example someone whose life is very stagnant or unmotivated the common theme of the record is going to be character flaws such as the song nihility which is about nihilism or absolute destructiveness weve decided to record the album ourselves seeing as we have an amazing engineer mike hatalak in the band the plus side to this is that we have endless time in the studio to perfect the record now im sure everyone who cares has heard the rumors of a heavy record well its true were writing a lot more caitiff choir like riffs and were working on a more raw and ballsy atmosphere for this record expect sincerity passion and fucking power
196893 n o sei o que que a capcom no geral pensa sobre isto mas o devil may cry 4 no pc n o est a vender t o bem como eu pensava nos estados unidos
196894 det her er m ske det allerbedste resultat der kunne komme ud af den sag akp har 47 pct af befolkningen bag sig s hvis de var blevet forbudt kunne man have stillet sp rgsm lstegn ved den demokratiske udvikling i tyrkiet men samtidig har partiet f et en klar advarsel i og med at de ikke bliver frikendt og de har f et at vide at de har bev get landet i en forkert retning
196895 hvis partiet var blevet forbudt var aktierne h jest sandsynligt faldet en lille smule tilbage men det l i konsensus at de vil tabe sagen det d rlige scenarie var priset ind i markedet
196896 to tredjedele af det tyrkiske marked er ejet af udlandet og n r der opst r usikkerhed om landets politiske stabilitet s smider man investeringerne da det giver en risiko med hensyn til aktier og valuta er tyrkiet blandt de mest volatile markeder i verden
196897 its not necesarry that the applicant have to belong to the human species so do not hesitate
196898 the fact that the band was living so far away from me was getting out of control and the music was just not my kind of style
196899 i learned quickly that he had to prioritize his time with farming and with me

196916 that lets the salesperson follow up in a timely manner when clients show interest
196917 this is about doing what is right for the business and the benefit to the environment that is an added bonus
196918 to be truly effective one has to be able to link everything together and understand how everything contributes to value and cost
196919 virtual support centers such as home based employees field service avoidance and field service optimization as each relates to gas consumption emissions and contributions to a corporations carbon footprint
196920 the big unknown is how future regulatory involvement will impact business technology
196921 since data centers will demand the lions share of the electricity and produce the corresponding co 2 emissions there is a likely scenario of carbon emission caps that corporations will need to adhere to making upgrades in energy efficiency now payoff big later if carbon caps are put in place
196922 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
196923 we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain who has fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
196924 weve seen this happen before and were not going to let it happen to us
196925 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
196926 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
196927 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
196928 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
196929 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
196930 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
196931 this rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months
196932 or if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt
196933 thats why today im announcing a two part emergency plan to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track
196934 across this country americans are hurting and todays job numbers are just the latest reminder of the economic challenges we face unlike sen obama i do not believe that raising taxes is the answer to our economic problems there is no surer way to force jobs overseas than to raise taxes on businesses
196935 is proposing to offset the cost of his emergency energy rebates over the next five years by enacting a windfall profits tax on big oil companies
196936 this suggests that the flu vaccine doesnt protect seniors as much as has been thought
196937 despite our findings and even though immune responses are known to decline with age i still want my grandmother to keep getting the flu vaccine
196938 the flu vaccine is safe so it seems worth getting even if it might lower the risk of pneumonia and death only slightly

196940 lo primero que debe atenderse en todo el pa s es a proporcionar a la clase m s numerosa y menos acomodada los medios de llenar sus primeras necesidades y particularmente aquellas que tienen directa influencia sobre la higiene y la salud
196941 saber que muchas enfermedades son curables en cuanto sus causas determinantes son conocidas y pueden ser suprimidas es el primer paso y cae bajo el dominio de la ciencia la voluntad y los medios necesarios para la remoci n de esas causas corresponde al pueblo suplirlos por medio de su organizaci n municipal o pol tica

196944 en la calera a un poco mas de 1 km de la orilla del r o se ve el campamento donde se han olvidado todas las reglas de higiene del paludismo y del tifus no hay un filtro para el agua en todo el campamento el efecto de tanta inmundicia de tanto insecto y malestar es que ni uno solo de los que vive en aquel centro ha escapado al paludismo hombres robustos y j venes llenos de vida en cuatro meses se han convertido en tipos enfermizos sin carne sin fuerzas ni color

196946 obligar a los inquilinos a pagar una cuota suplementaria de diez centavos por metro c bico es injusto porque el obrero necesita mas agua que el resto de la poblaci n por su trabajo y su vivienda pues dispone de poca ropa y debe lavarla frecuentemente en la misma habitaci n y por su familia carece de recursos para encomendar el lavado a otro adem s en tiempos de ardiente verano cuando se observa el xodo de las clases acomodadas hacia los balnearios el debe permanecer en la capital

196956 hay 1 200 millones de personas en pa ses en desarrollo que no tienen acceso agua potable en buenas condiciones y 2 200 que no disponen de saneamiento b sico la escasez de agua limpia provoca problemas de higiene y enfermedades
196957 hoy el estado no tiene pol ticas sociales para el campo con las que pueda garantizar desde la distribuci n del agua hasta el cr dito o subsidio a los peque os productores para que puedan seguir existiendo produciendo y manteniendo a sus familias en el campo se sigue adelante con este modelo los desmontes la concentraci n de la tierra y la expulsi n de poseedores
196958 en una zona donde est s preparado culturalmente para producir agricultura al sacarte uno de los recursos importantes como es el agua te inhabilitan para hacer lo que siempre supiste hacer distinto es en la zona de secano donde nunca lleg el riego hay cultura de ganader a hay otra forma de producir y otra relaci n con el agua a partir de eso pero en las zonas que siempre han basado su producci n en el doble recurso la tierra y el agua sac ndoles ese recurso los obligaron pr cticamente a dejar de ser productores a dejar de ser campesinos
196959 ante la preocupante situaci n que viven millones de personas en el mundo que no tienen acceso seguro al agua ni al saneamiento donde los cuerpos de agua contaminada envenenan a nuestras comunidades y ecosistemas en que organismos internacionales y empresas transnacionales promueven privatizar los servicios de agua y saneamiento en el contexto del interese en las ganancias por encima de la justicia y los derechos humanos es urgente que la sociedad civil denuncie y trabaje por cambiar esta situaci n

196977 when we originated the event almost 10 years ago the summer was typically a down time for the team and we were not visible
196978 we created the beach bash because it gave us a presence in the community it served as an event to keep us visible during the summer months when we were not playing we thought it was a win win event for everyone
196979 the city of avalon has been a phenomenal partner with us for years
196980 the area neighborhoods all participate and we are getting a lot of support from the mayor bob kennedy the residents and local businesses so its been the perfect city for us to host this event
196981 we are extremely excited to be back at jacks place they are a phenomenal partner with us jacks is a great location to have an event like this
196982 the beach bash is now equally exciting outside as it is inside of jacks place i think that is the best way we have expanded we reached out to all age groups and have created an activity for everybody so they can all be touched by sixers basketball
196983 when you see the sixers the flyers all the sports teams that come out that shows how tight this community is
196984 if we can do that and continue to do that that makes this a better place to live and play for everybody
196985 it was a little hot but thanks to julie and her spray fan we stayed cool
196986 hopefully we raised a lot of money for charity it was a great event last year we had fun so we came back and we had a lot of fun today too
196987 it just further solidified the team it really let us bond
196988 it taught us a lot about teamwork and just being there for each other it made us even better friends than we already are
196989 nobody knew what the score was nobody knew how many hits anybody got it was just the fact that they came together for a common cause and renewed some friendships

196997 my message has been taken on board and i am happy at what i have heard
196998 i have also held meetings with shipping industry representatives and believe that the industry has acknowledged a positive change
196999 it is also clear that there is now more consistency on how mariners are treated by uscg officials between different sectors and jurisdictions
197000 unfortunately i have received reports from highly respected professionals recounting coast guard boardings inspections and investigations not displaying professionalism
197001 additionally some have said they lost the complete trust they once had in the coast guard and are fearful of retribution if they challenge the coast guards conduct
197002 we must change this perception americas position in the global economy public and environmental safety and post 9 11 security are at stake
197003 to keep in mind that our countrymen are free men and as such are impatient of everything that bears the least mark of a domineering spirit
197004 this applies as much today as it did in 1790 and equally to international mariners and our trading partners
197005 licensed and documented mariners are professionals who share our interests in a safe secure and environmentally compliant industry

197008 for twenty five centuries western knowledge has tried to look upon the world it has failed to understand that the world is not for the beholding it is for hearing it is not legible but audible our science has always desired to monitor measure abstract and castrate meaning forgetting that life is full of noise and that death alone is silent work noise noise of man and noise of beast noise bought sold or prohibited nothing essential happens in the absence of noise

197026 critics of the self regulatory approach said they were troubled by the lack of industrywide definitions on what advertising to children entailed and on what better food meant
197027 in the better business bureau program the companies themselves determine what is better food the companies themselves determine what is childrens advertising the companies determine all these things theres not even a real uniformity in what these decisions are
197028 one place to start would be a ban on tv advertising to children under 12 another would be stop marketing to kids in school including through vehicles such as channel one

197039 for a long time there has been a reaction building among jewish progressives a phrase that seems oddly redundant against the domination of pro israel and jewish organizations by right wing extremists who represent nothing but their own prejudices and certainly do not represent the american jewish community as i have pointed out before without american jews the organized antiwar movement would be significantly smaller as well as a lot less organized that is certainly the case around antiwar coms virtual office in any case kleins outspokenness which i think underestimates the power of christian neoconservatives and not only evangelicals is part of this new frankness about the ethnic factor in american politics which is coming to the fore in this era of obamamania and thats all to the good now that he has gotten his letter from abe foxman been there done that klein ought to wear it as a badge of honor foxman for his part has been discredited as an embarrassment and a bit of a buffoon with his brazen attempts to shut down all criticism of the correct line on israel and its american amen corner
197040 in recent polls the majority of respondents believe that mccain as president would continue mr bushs policies in iraq and on the economy how much of a liability is bush one mccain aide refers to him as kryptonite the irony says a mccain supporter is that bush could end up beating mccain on both his runs for the presidency conventions are usually a place to finesse a candidates liabilities and yet mccain has to give kryptonite a prime time speaking spot when i asked gop veterans whether there was any way to minimize the damage for mccain their first reaction was to laugh since the convention starts on a monday one member of the mccain campaign joked that bush could speak on sunday night another veteran republican suggested putting up an onstage dunking booth for the president
197041 there are some places you simply cannot go rhetorically not because they are self contradictory but because they are self contrapractory if thats even a word wait they already have one for acting against what you say and vice versa it starts with rhymes with democracy and starts with hyp so lets have no more of this america is too polarized and we need to unify stuff politics is no place for silliness
197042 the royal screwing of american taxpayers will only get worse in the near future for a interlocking mixture of reasons that are in many cases nothing more than flimsy justifications your taxes are going to go up especially the hidden taxes that disguise themselves as fees or fines your hold on your own property is going to loosen in some cases there will be nothing you can do to preserve your wealth from the government thugs in others your greatest protection is privacy
197043 even before the polar bear received threatened status under the endangered species act in may a host of organizations were already laying the groundwork for a legal challenge as early as last january jim sims the president and ceo of the western business roundtable which reps for oil and mining interests sent an email to colleagues detailing a strategy to quite possibly reverse the ruling if the worst came to pass part of it would involve litigation filed by a truly extraordinary plaintiff roy innis the chairman of the congress of racial equality core a decades old civil rights group that has taken a sharp turn to the right under his leadership joining forces with conservative activists particularly on issues related to the environment it looks like the plan is finally in motion
197044 if americans dont produce item x that is not necessarily a bad thing in fact it could be a very good thing and itd be a very bad thing to use tariffs to keep americans producing x isnt it a good thing that a quarter of americans arent farmers today like they were a hundred years ago basic stuff this pattern has been the evolution and growth of all economies inefficient production seeks out more efficient places countries dont keep on producing the same stuff year in year out and on net everyone benefits over the long run
197045 you could say that the joker lives much of his life in the zone and this clearly adds to his charisma allowing him to attract co conspirators who aid him in his schemes what makes him insane rather than a rational criminal mastermind you may see in other movies is that he is not committed to power or wealth but to chaos and mayhem for its own sake and he is insane and he is a villain but in many movies one wonders why the villains are the way they are who would kill so many people for a few million dollars after all wont the irs be on their tail in a few years anyway if they flee the country wont the cia hunt them down

197053 this presidential themed exhibition is fitting for an historical moment for our state and country
197054 we want to welcome the thousands of people from around the world who will be here in september for the republican national convention delegates media and others in a way only this museum can offer
197055 we applaud the minneapolis institute of arts for embracing its role as one of the regions most important cultural institutions during a time of historical significance
197056 this will compliment civicfest as another way to give minnesotans an opportunity to join in the festivities around the convention
197057 elisebeth who just where did this dumb bimbo come from and where did she get all of her expertise

197060 i love children and think it is a wonderful organization and volunteering there is a good way to give back
197061 i have gained friendships and hope to bring more programs to the organization because i really think women are looking for something
197062 the films hold up as social comments in relation to what seemed to be a changing world
197063 for an awkward audience that didnt necessarily understand the order of things
197064 i would perhaps say i was someone to identify with one of the things about me is that im vulnerable you can see through me
197065 i let myself be known before i understood myself but had i understood what i was doing i couldnt have accomplished it
197066 hey your not alone because i aswell have gone through it
197067 carnegie museum of art has long believed in the importance of education in with and through the arts

197072 the beautiful hatch show prints and the incredible costumes and boots from marty stuarts collection make this one of the most visually dynamic exhibits weve ever had on display at emp sfm
197073 were especially pleased to honor the class of 2008 because these pioneers have not only pushed back the frontiers of air and space exploration theyve also become strong positive role models for todays youth
197074 aviation and space exploration as embodied by the people we honor in our hall of fame is a metaphor for the american pioneering spirit its a critical part of our legacy as a world technology leader we must inspire todays kids to tackle the tough science technology engineering and math challenges which lie ahead october 25th will be an evening san diegans will remember for a long time and not want to miss its our chance to honor these legends on behalf of every san diegan
197075 inspiring kids to undertake tough science and engineering challenges is only the first step

197082 sono moderatamente soddisfatto dice il presidente sulla carta un buon sorteggio ma attenti a non abbassare la guardia in campo europeo non c mai nulla di certo ed i sorteggi vanno poi verificati sul campo loro hanno uno stadio di 15 000 posti che sar sicuramente pieno e quindi per noi un match non facile in casa loro anche come atmosfera
197083 sono molto contento sorride il direttore generale perch io ed il presidente presenti al sorteggio abbiamo portato fortuna da qui a dire per che un turno facile ce ne vuole lalbania un paese in continua evoluzione calcistica e in casa loro i match non sono mai una passeggiata inoltre hanno dimostrato contro gli sloveni nel turno precedente di essere pericolosi anche in trasferta considerato il successo per 2 1 e una societ che lavora bene con una squadra giovane di buone prospettive sulla carta resta un buon sorteggio ma bisogna sempre giocarsela
197084 il calcio albanese cresciuto molto dice il tecnico azzurro in questi anni e per questo bisogna stare molto attenti certo inutile nascondere che potrebbe essere una squadra alla nostra portata ma non per questo il caso di autorizzare eccessivo ottimismo loro hanno battuto nel turno precedente una squadra slovena e questo indicativo di una buona qualit tecnica il nostro piccolo vantaggio sar quello di poter giocare la seconda gara al san paolo ma per il resto bisogner stare molto concentrati perch le squadre albanesi sono sempre difficili da affrontare
197085 i know that there are times in your life when the wheels just seems to turn and uncertainty about your tomorrow seem to grow

197099 deshalb werde ich mich auch ber das ma hinaus engagieren das ich mir eigentlich vorgestellt hatte
197100 mir ist aber wichtig dass in einer gesamtbetrachtung sowohl pers nliches verhalten als auch die politische lebensleistung in die beurteilung einbezogen werden

197104 all documents correspondence and other material including electronic material related to the graniteville vaucluse and warrenville incorporation effort
197105 all records from the accounts engaged in the graniteville vaucluse and warrenville incorporation effort to include names of all donors and all recipients of any and all money involved in the effort
197106 since they are a public body those records should be disclosed
197107 i think those that will be affected by that decision deserve full disclosure
197108 donations from individuals made as tax exempt donations and appeared to funnel them through its accounts to further support the effort
197109 i remain puzzled by the arrangement whereby a public body take private money for political purposes
197110 i am alarmed by the reluctance of lscog to turn over the record of those transactions
197111 when the lscog releases the records it has the authority to release it will show that approximately 39 500 in donations have been received through june 2008 and during that time approximately 33 500 have been spent on legal services accounting services bank and accounting charges office supplies and public meeting expenses
197112 none of these funds held by the lscog have been spent on any political campaign and none will be for any political campaign including influencing the outcome of the gvw election
197113 understands that the lscog is reviewing the requested records and seeking legal advice on what may and may not be released under the foia since some of the donors requested anonymity on their donations as expressly allowed by the provisions of the foia
197114 she demonstrated no regard for the safety of others with her reckless criminal speeding which was captured by our stationary photo enforcement cameras
197115 she knew what she did but refused to take responsibility for her actions the law is very clear when it comes to criminal speeding and reckless driving
197116 we are not at this time making any official statements or comments regarding this situation
197117 i had thought our shelter was close to no kill but i was sadly mistaken im going to send around emails to round up some contributions because i did not realize the problem was this bad
197118 i dont think barbour has any idea how appalled people on the coast are over this
197119 the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion
197120 we strongly support the great work of the national urban leagues project ready program this program is particularly effective in encouraging students to set goals and understand the correlation between higher education and future life success
197121 we are very proud of the great work that project ready has already accomplished to educate at risk 9th and 10th grade students we are thankful for all the support we have received and are excited to work with at amp t to rollout the project to include 11th and 12th graders
197122 i categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of justice jose sabio that i was waiting in the car while he was allegedly meeting with francis de borja on july 1 2008 at the ateneo law school in rockwell
197123 moreover i was out of the country when the alleged meeting between francis and justice sabio took place on july 1 i was in the united states for a medical check up and returned only on july 13 this is documented
197124 have the habit of waiting in the car for anybody except for my wife
197125 i know francis de borja but i have not authorized him or anybody to make representations for any matter that involves cases of meralco and the lopez family
197126 we have retainers and lawyers to handle the legal matters further francis is not a lawyer nor is he connected with meralco
197127 the lopez family is not in the business of bribing people in the pursuit of its businesses or to win cases in court
197128 is a friend but he is not in anyway connected with any of the family businesses especially that of meralco
197129 clearly the matter is between francis and justice sabio it is lamentable that my name was dragged into this
197130 i can charge him with bribery or perjury because he told a lie in a sworn statement maybe even libel for trying to discredit me
197131 because i pitied him de borja i was trying to protect him and then he did this to me now hes trying to discredit me
197132 since i had given a firm no to his offer i thought the matter had already been settled mr de borja however kept pestering me with phone calls and text messages i never initiated the calls
197133 submit to a lie detector test to see whos telling the truth
197134 produce his phone records to prove that i ever contacted him
197135 the time i called i was with manolo lopez then he was on his way to america thats why its just me who came to talk to you
197136 related that because he is very close to the lopezes of meralco he wanted to call him regarding his possible inhibition in a certain meralco case
197137 lopezes desire that the same justice with whom the lopezes are more comfortable sit in the ca division
197138 to tell him once and for all to stop pestering me
197139 this case will be brought to the supreme court and you will still lose it would be a waste if you dont accept the p10 million your children may blame you later
197140 if you will not accept we will be forced to look for other ways no matter what i salute you
197141 mr de borja would be supported by the firm he told me he was the one who recommended the firm theyre really trying to intimidate me
197142 his affidavit was prepared by a lawyer to picture me as a person who would accept a bribe only a lawyer can do such a well presented affidavit
197143 i expect matters to get worse because im up against the billions of the lopezes
197144 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
197145 empowering isabela voters to reclaim their democratic right to elect leaders of their own choosing and to contribute as full partners in their own development
197146 if people find it truthful we also print that so where is the bias
197147 so i got back to my apartment here and i had an epiphany
197148 so i sat on my bed and across from me was my pile of meaningless phone numbers of women that ive met
197149 this is 4 in the morning wayne dyer and everybody says 4 in the morning is the time when the world is quietest and its super spiritual and i said the only way im going to meet terrific women i have to burn the ship so i took this pile of numbers and i went to the incinerator and i blessed all the women and asked them for my soul back and i blessed it and i kissed it and i threw it down the incinerator and it started my new quest for meaning and it sta hi how are you

197207 programming is a design activity a good software design process recognizes this and does not hesitate to code when coding makes sense
197208 and it is not just coding that is a design activity
197209 coding is design testing and debugging are part of design and what we typically call software design is still part of design
197210 one may get the impression that jack is just a cowboy coder who disdains the traditional notion of design
197211 in software engineering we desperately need good design at all levels in particular we need good top level design the better the early design the easier detailed design will be
197212 eventually we have to create the real software design and it will be in some programming language therefore we should not be afraid to code our designs as we derive them we simply must be willing to refine them as necessary all design activities interact a good software design process recognizes this and allows the design to change sometimes radically as various design steps reveal the need
197213 the source code may be the master design document but it is seldom the only one necessary
197214 what approach they choose doesnt matter until someone starts insisting that these intermediate designs should be products in their own right its the code that matters if you get good code does it really matter how it came about if you dont get good code does it really matter how much other garbage you made people do before they wrote the bad code
197215 how their team has what it takes to turn it around this season
197216 im interested in anybody thats a good player thats my job
197217 i dont want to start the controversy but were going to look into it and certainly do our work on glenn eric parker just got released
197218 youve got to have as many people as you can working on the field weve had a couple offensive linemen in to work out we might bring in a couple receivers who knows who were going to bring in but well fill that roster spot as soon as possible
197219 these are uncertain times we live in do not contemplate becoming a portraitist unless you truly enjoy painting people paintings that are most likely to fall into this category usually have subject matter that is not imposing that has broad appeal he assisted leys in painting historical murals in antwerp s town hall i compare them to sculpture or painting where now the artist now the model imposes his personality you might also be planning for painting walls flooring adding new fixtures to kitchen and bathrooms installing heating and air conditioning systems creating an additional room and much more if not cleaning and repainting would do for a simple work of art like painting it can be sold through auctioning in the millions individuals who wish to tour the galleries or perhaps even purchase a unique painting or sculpture to take home with them they are sure to find a gallery in which to do so for example daily activities planned for children ages 3 to 7 may include arts and crafts face painting camp out night candy bar bingo outdoor fun and a pajama party as education has been made available to children of all ages drawing and painting have been found to be useful tools to engage their attention i feel like a little kid who has just discovered the joy of finger painting consider balance composition and colour of a painting i forgot to mention my trusty set of three halogen torches for light painting more probable though is that the paintings were commissioned by lorenzo for his teenaged sons piero and giovanni facing a killer hurricane while planning to abduct a young girl from her grandparents
197220 to some extent the appearance of paris hilton and britney spears people complain about it

197222 one of the key issues over buying robinho has always been that real madrid are looking for a replacement
197223 it is fair to say that is what has been holding up discussions between the two clubs it has not progressed over the last couple of days but the window is open until the end of august and theres still plenty of time to run
197224 i think there is absolutely no question that any deal will be done with regard to didier drogba

197226 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
197227 not only from public but also from party offices and completely disappear from the public arena not give interviews and not even publish literary works in a word become invisible long enough for the dayton agreement to be implemented in full
197228 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
197229 it is clear that unable to fulfil the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
197230 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
197231 holbrookes wish for my disappearance is today still fresher and stronger and the actions aimed at bringing this about are tireless
197232 while these activities continue and with this threat to my life i have to sit in a place which is known to him and his friends and prepare my defence
197233 i was in danger of being liquidated because i had made a commitment
197234 i cannot imagine that his defence would be anything but a political one
197235 the family has always said they have evidence of proof of the secret agreement
197236 what me report on a scandal you sound absolutely plebian
197237 holland are a really nice team to watch and they have many great players these are the guys you pay to go and watch it will be great just to be on the same pitch as them
197238 however although they have many good players we need to show we can compete with them and learn so we can go to the olympics with confidence
197239 i have never said that ronaldo is a slave but i said slavery with young people european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 year old boys and bring them to the big clubs i have never mentioned that for ronaldo but the press they have distorted it
197240 they real madrid and manchester united will solve this problem
197241 thanks for your patience so what can i do for you
197242 you mean i waited all this time and you arent even going to do anything for me i read on the internet about all these treatments
197243 but arent you even going to prescribe me anything some lotion or maybe give me a shot and what about this pain
197244 i could have just gone to the drugstore and gotten all of that stuff
197245 there can not be a more arrogant doc anywhere in any er
197246 he should really be locked up and the key thrown away and maybe for good measure injected with something really nasty

197253 theres no coming back from renal failure its not good news but is what we expect from these cases

197261 education is literally the difference between surviving and thriving for working class americans congress adoption today of the college cost reduction and access act will ensure that access to education is a reality for all
197262 this historic bill will expand access to college and provides1 unprecedented financial support for working class families the disabled and historically black colleges and universities strengthen counseling services that focus on helping low income and minority students remain in school and graduate increase college aid and support for veterans and military families and support the renovation of campuses in need of improvement
197263 today we have made an invaluable investment in our future
197264 hbcus have played and continue to play an integral role in furthering the education of black students in america
197265 unfortunately these institutions face increasing challenges and have limited resources i am very pleased with the historical investment to hbcus that the college cost reduction and access act will provide it is a much needed step in the right direction and will go a long way toward helping hbcus continue to provide a quality education to our nations youth
197266 we have every intention of reopening the museum once we get a plan in place
197267 on the design specific aspects of the application who our vendor is can make a lot of difference as to what technology we use for the design
197268 so when we didnt have the final vendor we werent able to answer the questions to either ours or the nrcs level that we wanted to answer those questions so we asked them to hold up on the review of the design specific parts of the application
197269 they did about 30 000 man hours of due diligence with toshiba to determine their abilities and as they did this due diligence they determined that not only are they capable of building the units to the standards that we expect but they are exceptionally able to build them to the highest standards
197270 toshiba has been lead contractor on two of the units built in japan and subcontractor on a third one
197271 we dont want one set of rules for people whose collars are blue or whose names end in vowels and another set for those whose collars are white and have ivy league diplomas
197272 one of the largest and most beguiling works of art on the entire continent
197273 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
197274 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
197275 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
197276 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
197277 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
197278 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
197279 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
197280 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
197281 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
197282 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
197283 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
197284 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
197285 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
197286 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
197287 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
197288 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
197289 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
197290 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
197291 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
197292 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
197293 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
197294 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
197295 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
197296 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
197297 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget

197738 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
197739 all about the beat why hip hop cant save black america
197740 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
197741 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
197742 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
197743 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
197744 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
197745 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
197746 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
197747 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
197748 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc

197798 wir freuen uns dass es bereits in den ersten monaten der neuen legislaturperiode gelungen ist viele forderungen aus unserem gr nen sofortprogramm schule umzusetzen wir bedauern dass entgegen den ank ndigungen kultusminister banzer und die cdu mit ausnahme der korrekturen am g8 im landtag gegen alle diese nderungen gestimmt haben die korrekturen von zumindest einigen fehlern der vergangenheit treten also trotz und nicht wegen kultusminister banzer und der cdu in kraft
197799 wir sind uns bewusst dass diesen ersten schritten weitere folgen m ssen unsere schulen brauchen eine dauerhafte verl ssliche grundlage und vor allem eine bessere ausstattung leider hat die gesch ftsf hrende landesregierung die informationen f r den daf r notwendigen nachtragshaushalt bislang nicht vorgelegt eine weit reichende verbesserung der situation an den schulen wird daher leider voraussichtlich erst mit dem landeshaushalt 2009 in kraft treten k nnen

197822 booze has presided over executions and business deals and marriages and births it inspired the ancient greeks to invent not only democracy but comedy and tragedy it helped goad americas founding fathers into revolution one of drink s most fascinating subplots as it turns out is humanitys apparently universal contempt for water in ancient greece water drinkers were believed not only to lack passion but also to exude a noxious odor in post wwi france they were thought to be fat weak and pimply hurtful prejudices that i having once been publicly berated by an irishwoman for ordering a pint of water at a pub can confirm still exist today in fact such enduring hydrophobia might make for a good popular history of its own if only we could get someone to write it

197837 i hope there will be enough shareholder pressure at this meeting for the board to realize they need to bring in someone else to run the company
197838 undeniably low maternal vitamin d affects the way the brain develops
197839 over the past four years weve been able to show that low vitamin d intake in animals during pregnancy results in offspring with brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia
197840 the danes are only able to give us 1 6 microlitres of plasma so weve had to come up with a method of determining the vitamin d levels in that tiny amount of blood
197841 in collaboration with alun jones at the institute of molecular bioscience weve developed a way to easily measure low levels of vitamin d using mass spectrometry
197842 if we establish the link in this huge patient cohort we will be able to show that having low maternal vitamin d does not necessarily mean a child is going to develop schizophrenia but if a child has a particularly vulnerable genome the low maternal vitamin d may be the environmental trigger
197843 its the combination of gene and environment which triggers the disease
197844 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first
197845 but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
197846 high infection rates are in particular observed related to implants catheters and stents
197847 those for urinary catheters mounting up to 30 per week

197849 we were able to demonstrate that our hybrid firmly attaches to titanium dioxide surfaces and effectively hinders infection with bacillus subtilis as well as the attachment of cellular material
197850 this study lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of different mutations in cancers
197851 and helps with understanding the mechanisms of cancers and their responses to drug treatments

197853 this research report completely changes our understanding of the many gene mutations that cause cancer
197854 the main driving idea is to frame the discussion of leadership equity accountability and partnerships around concrete actionable goals
197855 its time to set specific goals and hold everyone accountable for reaching them
197856 is that beyond rhetoric and philosophical debates the aim of all contributions is to suggest practical ways to move forward in some cases through explicit recommendations in others through directions for shaping or reshaping the environments in which the spread of hiv can be curbed and access to quality care and treatment can be made available to all who need it
197857 it is increasingly clear that despite laudable advances in hiv technologies and outcomes true success is still evasive continually being thwarted by age old issues such as stigma discrimination poverty and lack of accountability
197858 new paradigms are needed for understanding and responding to the aids pandemic and this journal is a timely and constructive source of information for those efforts

197860 globally significant nesting of the leatherback turtle dermochelys coriacea on the caribbean coast of colombia and panama
197861 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
197862 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
197863 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
197864 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
197865 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions

197889 mit dem auto gabs bei mir gott sei dank noch nichts mein letzter unfall war auf dem mountainbike ein waldweg und bergab ich hatte wohl etwas die geschwindigkeit untersch tzt und mir zur strafe das bein aufgerissen

197896 dass der transfer von gomez nicht geklappt hat lag nicht an uns die stuttgarter wollten ihn partout nicht abgeben dabei sind 25 millionen euro plus x ja kein pappenstil
197897 ja das h tten wir riskiert 25 millionen und sogar noch ein wenig mehr
197898 nein das ist klugheit konsolidierung auf hohem niveau wir glauben dass wir auf allen positionen gut bis sehr gut besetzt sind wir haben vergangene saison mit dem transfer von acht spielern ein markenzeichen gesetzt aber f r die champions league muss man eine eingespielte mannschaft haben wenn wir alle am ende der saison feststellen dass auf irgendeiner position was fehlt werden wir im n chsten jahr wieder was tun
197899 es gab ja bisher gar keine gelegenheit dazu als wir im fr hjahr reden wollten hat bastian uns darum gebeten es nicht zu tun weil seine management situation nicht gekl rt war dann kamen die em und der urlaub wir haben nun vereinbart dass wir uns ende september anfang oktober zusammensetzen er hat uns signalisiert dass er gerne bleiben m chte wir haben ihm gesagt dass wir nichts dagegen haben
197900 wir wollen sehen wie er sich in dem neuen umfeld mit tim borowski ist ja noch ein mittelfeldspieler hinzugekommen behauptet wir werden mit ihm reden sobald sein stellenwert im verein gekl rt ist den kennen wir derzeit nicht wenn bastian am 15 september mittelfeld k nig bei bayern ist dann wird die situation anders aussehen als wenn er nur auf der bank sitzt es liegt an ihm er muss die em leistungen aus dem t rkei oder portugal spiel ber einen langen zeitraum zeigen dann wird er hier keine probleme haben

197960 the australian greens have been campaigning about the plight of the murray for years
197961 we know the scientists keep telling us we only have until october this year to make an impact on saving the river by getting new water released into the river system immediately
197962 what is the government doing now to make sure we save the murray yes its buying some water and investing in some infrastructure but there is no immediate plan for new water to be released further upstream to help the dying lakes and coorong
197963 all the government has is a plan for a plan a plan that wont take effect until 2019 when its hoping that the state governments will have brought their water sharing plans into line with the sustainable cap
197964 that means we will have a lovely plan but the river will be dead by 2019 the coorong will be gone and so too may the communities along the lower river areas
197965 the reality is unless we can curb water use and put sustainable measures into place in the extremely near future we are going to be watching the river die
197966 kevin rudd must step up and take charge of the situation he promised his leadership would see the states come together for the health of the river and this still hasnt happened
197967 to do this we need the federal government to step in and secure the release of water stored in the menindee lakes and to purchase some of the water in major storages in northern nsw
197968 this is a national catastrophe and any government who is prepared to sit back and hide behind the bureaucracy of endless planning and toothless agreements is irresponsible and negligent
197969 kevin rudd must do this now the murray needs a drink by christmas any later and the coorong will be gone
197970 you just have to watch us all the time thats all

198116 the macro environment in the u s and the u s carrier spend continues to be challenging
198117 of course in this environment we are increasing our cost controls across the board
198118 in the face of the severe operating environment nissan remains resilient but cautious on the outlook for our industry
198119 we have identified the major risks and taken actions to address them particularly in the u s market
198120 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
198121 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged

198132 justamente para nosotros esta audiencia no es sino la reafirmaci n de la b squeda de esa sentencia definitivamente firme en sede jurisdiccional que ponga el punto final
198133 c mo compatibilizar la posibilidad de inhabilitaci n con el art culo 42 de la constituci n que expresamente establece que el ejercicio de la ciudadan a o de alguno de los derechos pol ticos s lo puede ser suspendido por sentencia judicial firme igual con el 23 de la convenci n americana sobre derechos humanos que establece que se pueden reglamentar el ejercicio de derechos exclusivamente por razones de edad nacionalidad residencia idioma instrucci n capacidad civil o mental o condena por juez competente en proceso penal
198134 la sentencia que aqu en sala constitucional se dicte va a envolver la sentencia judicial firme a la que alude el art culo 42 de la constituci n
198135 estas sanciones son administrativas mal podr a significar una sentencia de la sala constitucional el fin del proceso porque esto no es un caso penal que se haya ventilado ante un juzgado penal
198136 desconoce la constituci n y decide a favor de las inhabilitaciones violar a el art culo 23 del pacto de san jos que habla de procesos penales solamente
198137 el art culo 105 de la ley de contralor a no viola el debido proceso
198138 depende de ustedes se ores magistrados despu s de 1 000 d as de retraso procesal escoger el camino depende de ustedes convertirse en defensores de la constituci n o enterrarla definitivamente
198139 hace 10 a os solicitaron inhabilitar al hoy presidente y la decisi n fue clara y contundente si no hay una sentencia penal definitivamente firme no hay inhabilitaci n meses despu s el pueblo lo eligi
198140 si se mantienen las inhabilitaciones sonar una alarma en todo el mundo y nos encargaremos que retumbe por siempre lo que significa esa violaci n a los derechos de los venezolanos a elegir y si se hace justicia que nos fortaleceremos los 27 millones de venezolanos
198141 como dicen los reclusos en venezuela justicia tard a no es justicia la justicia tiene que llegar antes de que llegue el per odo de inhabilitaciones
198142 salud de la democracia venezolana no es poca cosa que el gobierno utilizando y abusando del poder pretenda poner y quitar candidatos y las opciones del pueblo
198143 aqu nadie est presionando a nadie la presi n que pueden tener los magistrados es la constituci n y la historia o ser su conciencia la historia los pondr como los verdugos o no de la constituci n
198144 no es posible que sea el gobierno quien ponga y quite candidatos
198145 sobre la acusaci n que hizo la representante de la fiscal a consideramos que est fuera de orden
198146 si cometimos alg n delito se tuvo que haber abierto una averiguaci n esa averiguaci n llevada a un tribunal y el tribunal emitir una condena nosotros insistimos en lo que es la vigencia de la constituci n que establece que si no hay condena no puede haber inhabilitaci n
198147 la sala constitucional est en su responsabilidad de determinar la legalidad del art culo 105
198148 aqu hubo una cayapa por parte de la fiscal a la procuradur a y la contralor a est n pidiendo que la contralor a sin ning n tipo de juicio pueda inhabilitar quiere decir que somos hoy todos nosotros los 400 inhabilitados pero ma ana podr ser cualquiera si se da rango constitucional la inhabilitaci n
198149 aqu estamos alegando que los art culos 45 y 62 de la constituci n son muy claros yo le pregunto con quienes voy a hablar con la contralor a su opini n del art culo 7 que nada pude estar por encima de la constituci n
198150 el de la constitucionalidad o el de tirar por la borda la constituci n aqu la cosa es muy clara nos quieren inhabilitar porque tenemos el apoyo de 7 de cada 10 caraque os
198151 celebramos esta audiencia con respeto estamos muy confiados muy esperanzados tengan la plena seguridad que la verdad est en nuestro lado sentimos un gran respeto de la sala para nuestro caso
198152 denunciamos la desproporcionalidad de la medida accesoria no se justifica que nos inhabiliten pol ticamente por cinco a os si se demostr que no hubo da o al patrimonio p blico
198153 somos inocentes yo soy inocente no me llev ni un medio no estuve incurso en ning n acto de corrupci n no comet peculado

198164 every other weekend thats how often you see a friend
198165 when the law is dictating that one parent is better than the other the kids see that
198166 we took the approach to not have custodial or non custodial
198167 were just going to have parents who then agree on a parenting plan that focuses on the child
198168 it will also help to unclog the courts a little i hope
198169 women typically get custody because we still think in traditional ways men provide women nurture
198170 but that doesnt mean that women are better parents or that men cant or shouldnt be involved
198171 it might even help push us to another level by recognizing in a pointed way that children need their parents regardless of sex or gender to engage in the shared responsibilities of parenting
198172 ill do whatever i need to do to get 50 percent interest in my kids as far as their lives go
198173 he should keep focused on whats right for the children
198174 we know it is a busy community and there were a lot of people coming and going from the building during the course of the day
198175 we would like to speak to anyone who entered the block of flats numbering 48 62 ritchie place during the course of tuesday afternoon
198176 we have heard from quite a few of them already but are keen to trace everyone who visited the property so that we can build a picture of what happened in the hours prior to mr branigans death
198177 we really appreciate their co operation it is not something anyone would expect to happen literally on their doorstep
198178 the building became a crime scene and to help our specialists do their work we had to ask the local residents to leave their homes
198179 our examinations of most of the common areas of the building are now completed and some of the families have been able to return we hope it will not be too long until they are all back home

198189 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially here at home
198190 the sooner congress lifts the ban the sooner we can get this oil from the ocean floor to your gas tank
198191 the oil companies pushing for drilling is nothing more than a land grab
198192 there is a real misconception that proponents of drilling are fueling implying that somehow this oil is going to go directly to u s consumers
198193 the oil companies are the ones who are going to be the beneficiaries of this
198194 so any changes we make impact the world oil market not a separate domestic market
198195 this is a fantastic achievement for abertay and dare to be digital

198205 if the trend continues there wont be any elephants except in fenced areas with a lot of enforcement to protect them
198206 the situation is worse than ever before and the public is unaware
198207 its very serious because elephants are an incredibly important species they keep habitats open so other species that depend on such ecosystems can use them without elephants there will be major habitat changes with negative effects on the many species that depend on the lost habitat
198208 elephants also are a major part of ecotourism which is an important source of hard currency for many african countries
198209 public support stopped the illegal ivory trade back in 1989 and can do so again
198210 the work with dna sampling allows us to focus law enforcement on poaching hot spots
198211 it forces countries to take more responsibility for what goes on within their borders and it also gives us more insight on where to look so that hopefully we can stop the poachers before the elephants are actually killed
198212 this gene by itself does not appear to increase the risk for overall and for specific cardiovascular disease but rather this research suggests a possible connection between the gene variant and migraine with aura while it is too early to start testing young women with migraine with aura for this gene variant more focused research will help us to understand these complex links and will help us to potentially develop preventative strategies
198213 doctors should try to reduce heart disease risk factors and advise young women who experience migraine with aura not to smoke and to consider birth control pill alternatives as these increase the risk of ischemic vascular problems
198214 these findings suggest that some of the memory impairment experienced during aging could involve a reduction in the automatic process of experience replay
198215 this is the first study to suggest that an animals ability to perform a spatial memory task may be related to the brains ability to perform memory consolidation during sleep
198216 this studys findings could inspire the development and testing of pharmacological agents designed to enhance memory replay phenomena
198217 i find it particularly interesting that fish are capable of such a sophisticated behavior
198218 the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
198219 future studies will need to evaluate the potential for male mate choice copying and deception in natural populations because male mate choice copying cannot be evolutionarily stable if males always have an opportunity to deceive rivals
198220 big is gt mate or a meal familiarity decides if wolf spider loves em or eats em
198221 theres no excuse for any number of heat stroke deaths since they are all preventable with the proper precautions
198222 we have about 40 000 genes in every cell and the main reason a brain cell is a brain cell is because only a small fraction of the genes are turned on the remaining genes that are not expressed are shut down by an epigenetic process called dna methylation
198223 interestingly the nature of this chemical modification is long term and hard to reverse and this fits with depression
198224 the whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising finding that epigenetic mechanisms continue to influence gene expression is pretty unusual
198225 these observations open an entirely new avenue of research and potential therapeutic interventions
198226 this is an intriguing contribution to efforts aimed at identifying the molecular bases of alcohol tolerance
198227 this represents a novel and elegant mechanism by which neurons are able to adapt to alcohol
198228 moreover since adaptation or tolerance to the drug likely contributes to alcohol abuse our findings identify a potential molecular target for therapeutic intervention
198229 this study demonstrates for the first time that alcohol exposure can cause rapid changes in microrna levels altering gene expression and perhaps behavior
198230 in future studies it will be interesting to determine if similar microrna based regulatory mechanisms influence alcohol problems in human populations
198231 theres a lot of attention today on global food shortages
198232 weve found a gene that is key for proper chloroplast function this finding might some day help scientists develop plants that grow better and can serve as more nutritious food
198233 we have now shown that an analogous process is required for proper chloroplast function
198234 moreover without fro7 plants sown in iron deficient soil died as young seedlings our findings are of particular interest because how iron gets into chloroplasts has not been well understood despite the significance of iron in chloroplasts
198235 enriching crops with mineral and vitamin nutrients will provide sustainable solutions to malnutrition
198236 to the best of our knowledge this is the first molecular epidemiological study to evaluate mtdna content in lymphocytes as a susceptibility biomarker for cancer
198237 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
198238 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
198239 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
198240 the late paleozoic tropical climate was not buffered against cold from the high latitudes as everyone had thought
198241 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes this calls into question traditional assumptions of long lasting equatorial warmth in the late paleozoic and raises the possibility of large scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time
198242 complex climate models are tools that provide insights and knowledge into how future climate may evolve to assure that future climate projections are used appropriately it is crucial to understand what current models can simulate well and where models need improvements
198243 this report makes an important contribution in helping to describe and explain the current state of high end climate modeling for the non specialist
198244 the science of climate modeling has matured through finer spatial resolution the inclusion of a greater number of physical processes and through comparison to a rapidly expanding array of observations
198245 an average over the set of models clearly provides climate simulation superior to any individual model
198246 no current model is superior to others in all respects but rather different models have differing strengths and weaknesses
198247 climate change gt new research detects human induced climate change at a regional scale
198248 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time
198249 we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
198250 this tests the flies mental capacity in two ways first theyve got to remember that the lighted vial is the one that has quinine in it and then theyve got to suppress their natural instinct to fly toward the light
198251 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake
198252 i want to emphasize though that this type of treatment would just be for people who absolutely have to stay awake
198253 its not about trying to cram too many hours in your day everyone else should just suck it up and get a good nights sleep
198254 our new study shows that subjects with a mother with alzheimers show similarities with alzheimers patients
198255 they have metabolic reductions in the brain regions that are typically affected by ad which worsen over time
198256 this discovery has potentially solved a mystery that has been plaguing the avian veterinary community since the 1970s
198257 these results clearly reveal the existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse bornaviruses that are dramatically different from anything seen in other animals
198258 this provides a very compelling lead in the long standing search for a viral cause of pdd
198259 with the development of molecular clones and diagnostic tests for abv we can now begin to explore both the epidemiology of the virus and how it is linked to the disease state

198267 so much of the focus on this issue has been in africa but there the interface between humans and other primates is decreasing
198268 the intensity of bush meat hunting and infectious diseases have taken a huge toll on primate populations there individuals in africa who are interacting with other primates are often very isolated from other humans they live in small rural villages which limits the potential spread of pathogens
198269 some macaque species thrive in human altered environments given the tolerance of the local people
198270 this is a heterogeneous sample subjects reported contact with primates in a variety of contexts
198271 it seems that some of these contexts are going to be very important but they havent been studied much zoo workers and bush meat hunters have been typically considered at the highest risk for viral transmission but none of the zoo workers or hunters in our sample tested positive for sfv
198272 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
198273 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
198274 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
198275 these results might lead to new phage therapies for fighting infections that persist despite the antibiotics
198276 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
198277 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
198278 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
198279 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
198280 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions
198281 this study lays the groundwork for understanding the nature of different mutations in cancers
198282 and helps with understanding the mechanisms of cancers and their responses to drug treatments
198283 little could darwin have known that his origin of the species would one day explain the origin of the tumor
198284 this research report completely changes our understanding of the many gene mutations that cause cancer
198285 the tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties
198286 it has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide zirconia silica or a mixture of other oxides the precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user
198287 were currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers
198288 but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place
198289 these findings reinforce the fact that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy
198290 prenatal exposure to alcohol especially excessive amounts at one time can adversely affect the fetus and may increase the risk of infant clefts
198291 the greater the blood alcohol concentration the longer the fetus is exposed a single binge during a critical period of an infants development can be harmful
198292 fortunately heavy maternal drinking is uncommon in many populations but the fact that it is happening at all tells us we need to do a better job of letting mothers know about the effects that alcohol can have on their babys development
198293 climate change and its expected increase in global temperatures altered circulation of air masses and effects on local and regional weather patterns are expected to have profound impacts on the foraging and migratory behavior of insects birds and bats
198294 in contrast to organisms that depend strictly on terrestrial or aquatic existence those that routinely use the aerosphere are almost immediately influenced by changing atmospheric conditions e g winds air density precipitation air temperature sunlight polarized light moonlight and geomagnetic and gravitational forces
198295 appropriate integration of diverse tools and concepts for probing into the lives of organisms aloft can help inform important ecological and evolutionary concepts and management decisions associated with the spread of invasive species emergence of infectious diseases altered biodiversity and sustainability of terrestrial aquatic and aerospheric environments
198296 we all take for granted the internet and the fact that we can make telephone calls to other countries through our event you will be able to find out how the technology actually works and to see how far it has evolved in the last 150 years
198297 the first operational trans atlantic telegraph cable was landed on 5 august 1858 this link across the atlantic demonstrated the power of electrical communications and laid the foundations for todays global telephone calls the internet and world wide web
198298 in fact it was a manchester man john pender who invested 1 000 in this venture who became immensely important in the development of global communications it was his group of companies that became cable and wireless one of the worlds leading international communications companies
198299 today there are thousands of miles of underwater cable linking the world which now carry our phone calls the internet and world wide web

198310 we are pleased to welcome this group of highly respected partners to our global team
198311 each of these distributors offers integrated geographic and geospatial solutions based on esris arcgis products to a well established customer base and we are eager to help them meet the growing demand of gis professionals worldwide for image processing and geospatial information solutions
198312 we selected arcfm because it provides the technology platform that will support our growth so we are better positioned for the future
198313 at erdas we develop solutions that help organizations harness the information of the changing earth transforming geospatial data into business information
198314 erdas apollo breaks through the walls that separate geospatial and business data quickly managing and serving large volumes of geospatially enriched business information across an organization consumers are excited to know that they now have an option when building enterprise solutions
198315 for the past two years we have been preparing our organization for true enterprise gis and bridging a tremendous number of data assets weve made a significant investment in data preparation infrastructure expansion and application development to bring an enterprise wide gis to fruition
198316 an important part of that implementation process is ensuring that city employees have simplified access to the tools they need to build and use the system
198317 putting gis software in their hands with the ela assures they can acquire essential tools while nearly eliminating administrative burdens such as conducting complex internal license audits
198318 we are delighted to support the city of houston with this new agreement
198319 this ela will eliminate time consuming efforts to secure critical gis software and instead will allow the city to focus on achieving its vision of an organization wide gis to better serve citizens and staff
198320 in recent years doi has moved away from applying gis to single projects and now we are building a strong department wide capability
198321 geographic information underlies almost all the work that the interior does it provides us with a basis for data sharing and integration building a deeper understanding of places and resources which helps us make better decisions
198322 drawing on his experience as secretary of the interior and as former governor of idaho secretary kempthorne will share his insights on how gis helps government officials understand and act on complex issues like wildlife management alternative energy conservation water demands and wildland fires

198341 everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
198342 china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
198343 developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
198344 telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
198345 in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
198346 that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
198347 china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
198348 the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
198349 to be a respected responsible leader of the world we have to start thinking now about what we should do to lead up to the day when china has to lead and will be able to lead well climate change is one of the key issues there

198413 but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based president clinton was a force for unity in this country on this subject every american should be proud of his record as both a governor and president but we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united state of their own party

198589 a convoy of six vehicles was targeted as it was coming from the airport
198590 one of the vehicles was destroyed i saw au forces sealing off the area but i couldnt know how many people were hurt
198591 the au unequivocally condemns this cowardly and barbaric act perpetrated against an amisom peacekeeper deployed in mogadishu to safeguard somali lives
198592 will not deter the au the people of somalia and the un in their determination and commitment to intensify their efforts towards reconciliation peace and stability in line with the recently concluded agreement in djibouti
198593 the situation in somalia has been noted to be the worst it has ever been particularly in mogadishu and the outlying areas
198594 the current environment of conflict displacement and insecurity in southern and central somalia has a seriously negative impact on childrens and young peoples long term psychosocial welfare and healthy development
198595 however the functioning of these networks is being seriously hampered by the deteriorating security situation in the region and the targeting of aid workers which are hindering the urgently needed humanitarian access

198604 the current environment of conflict displacement and insecurity in southern and central somalia has a seriously negative impact on childrens and young peoples long term psychosocial welfare and healthy development
198605 ten years after those attacks in kenya and tanzania it appears we have missed the larger lesson of that tragic day and our front line diplomats continue to pay the price as they scramble to respond to the problems of weak states caught up in a vicious and turbulent cycle of collapse they arent the only ones paying the price however as those failed states breed insecurity and conditions favorable for terrorism ten years on the united states still does not have a long term strategy to bring peace and stability to the horn of africa we have tremendous diplomatic military intelligence and foreign assistance resources at our disposal but they are ineffective in the absence of a coordinated and balanced strategy that incorporates both the short and long term goals this is no more evident than in somalia
198606 defeating the terrorist enemy requires a comprehensive effort executed locally nationally regionally and globally working with partner nations we must eliminate terrorist leadership but incarcerating or killing terrorists will not achieve an end to terrorism we must simultaneously eliminate terrorist safe havens tailoring regional strategies to disaggregate terrorist networks and break terrorist financial travel communications and intelligence links finally and most challenging we must address the underlying conditions that terrorists exploit at the national and local levels to induce alienated or aggrieved populations to become sympathizers supporters and ultimately members of terrorist networks we can marginalize violent extremists by addressing peoples needs and grievances by giving people a stake in their own political future and by providing alternatives to what terrorists offer

198613 we welcome the news today that the authorities have lifted blocks on our website in the olympics media venues and possibly elsewhere in beijing
198614 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfill the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression

198621 los hechos de violencia impidieron lo que podr a haber sido un interesante y muy rico debate sobre el tema este tipo de expresiones violentas deben ser repudiadas porque siempre sabemos c mo empiezan pero nunca c mo terminan

198635 celebramos que el gobierno local se involucre con el tema de la seguridad esperamos que sta decisi n pueda llegar a buen puerto ojal esto se pueda profundizar y que sirva efectivamente para aumentar la seguridad y el comercio pueda ejercer el libre ejercicio de sus tareas
198636 puoi guardare indietro da un momento allaltro e dire in quel momento ero felice o pi spesso che non in quel momento ero a disagio o in quel momento ero triste o in quel momento eravamo tutti dei cretini ma puoi guardare indietro a tutto e pensare stato bello perch quando tutti i momenti si conciliano quando tutte le canzoni si uniscono ottieni qualcosa di intero e completo e fantastico persone che hai odiato persone che hai amato e un affetto per loro che forse non sarai capace di ricatturare e tutto quello che ricordi di loro in qualche modo di pi di quello che realmente erano perch quello che fanno i ricordi
198637 i wondered what i had let myself in for in these games
198638 soldiers with guns were sitting round the track watching the game
198639 the crowd were very close to the pitch and when i made the penalty save they became really intimidating towards me
198640 we wanted to wind down the game and our bench were screaming at me to slow up
198641 i was following instructions and taking it nice and easy when i felt something poked into my back
198642 i looked round and saw a soldier standing there with his gun pointed at me
198643 i couldnt understand what he said but i knew what he meant he was clearly telling me to get a move on
198644 so for the remaining few minutes i was operating at a million miles an hour
198645 of course the bench were going crazy with me because they couldnt understand why i was operating at top speed
198646 but gun law won there was no way i was taking the chance of that soldier or any of his mates having another go at me
198647 sean was jumping up and down and screaming at me to dive to my right at the penalty i just nodded my head went right and got to it
198648 the day before the game we got lost after going out for a walk
198649 our trainer neilly mochan wanted to take us to the beach but we went the wrong way and ended up climbing over peoples fences and going through backyards to try to find the sea
198650 i can still remember the amazed look on the faces of the homeowners as this squad of players marched through their gardens
198651 when we did get to the beach we were so far behind schedule that when sean drew the tactics out in a diagram on the sand the incoming tide washed it away
198652 it was certainly a memorable trip but mostly for the wrong reasons
198653 im certain the current team wont face the same problems this time round
198654 this is our decision to live fast and die young weve got the vision now lets have some fun yeah its overwhelming but what else can we do get jobs in offices and wake up for the morning commute
198655 i am a sinner in the eyes of the cpi m and not a gentleman thats why they thought i deserved the summary expulsion
198656 let them say whatever they are saying i would like to see how far they can go
198657 if they were being so accommodating to the extent of allowing me not to vote against the government why were they goading me to resign

198672 para tener xito toda y cualquier estrategia que quiera sacar provecho del crecimiento r pido y espont neo que se obtiene en internet debe de entrada analizar las actividades sociales de los consumidores a continuaci n debe evaluar los objetivos propuestos planear de qu forma cambiar la relaci n con el cliente y finalmente decidir qu tecnolog a social utilizar
198673 en el plazo de cinco a diez a os las redes sociales estar n por todas partes
198674 pero no es nuevo que las personas se sientan fascinadas entre ellas las redes sociales no son ninguna novedad simplemente descubrimos nuevas formas de ponerlas en pr ctica
198675 el proceso del descubrimiento de la informaci n est dejando de ser una actividad solitaria para convertirse en una actividad comunitaria

198677 hoy la computaci n social es una cosa que hacemos en una web espec fica
198678 sin embargo estamos percibiendo que ser social no es algo que se limite a una web es un concepto

198683 in like manner a generation that did not see john thomson has missed a touch of greatness in sport for which he was a brilliant virtuoso as gigli was and menuhin is one artiste employs the voice as his instrument another the violin or cello for thomson it was a handful of leather we shall not look upon his like again
198684 among the galaxy of talented goalkeepers whom celtic have had the late lamented john thomson was the greatest
198685 but alas his career was to be short in september 1931 playing against rangers at ibrox park he met with a fatal accident yet he had played long enough to gain the highest honours football had to give a most likeable lad modest and unassuming he was popular wherever he went
198686 his merit as a goalkeeper shone superbly in his play never was there a keeper who caught and held the fastest shots with such grace and ease in all he did there was the balance and beauty of movement wonderful to watch among the great celts who have passed over he has an honoured place

198736 you are never supposed to present ultimatums to people you love
198737 the whole thing really makes me crazy sometimes and as i said a little scarred too
198738 what makes me really mad is the fact that if that happens she will have been able to go through her whole life without having to really worry about anything
198739 i tell her all the time what she should be doing
198740 she wont ever move out unless i marry her why would she she practically has her own free apartment

198743 recognizing the strategic success that the surge has achieved in a central front the central front of the war on terror against the enemies who attacked america on 9 11 01
198744 the scientific community is a big fraternity where scientists exchange ideas pose questions and find answers through mutual collaboration so it is quite natural for scientists to reach out to each other to cover areas of knowledge that they are not familiar with
198745 rather than building a made in canada proposal to help musicians get paid the government has chosen to import american style legislation that says the solution to the music industrys problems is suing our fans suing fans wont make it 1992 again its a new world for the music business and this is an old approach
198746 its not musicians musicians dont need lawsuits what we do need is a government that is willing to sit down with all the stakeholders and craft a balanced copyright policy for canada that will not repeat the mistakes made in the united states

198750 we acknowledge that russia is far behind the leaders in the nanotechnology field such as the us japan and the eu however we have a long term aim of supplying 3 4 percent of the worlds nanotech market by 2015
198751 it is an area of activity in which the state is ready to invest on a grand scale
198752 it is a very promising scientific and technical field capable of fundamentally changing the model of the russian economy from a fuel economy to an economy of the future
198753 nanotechnology could not only change our whole economy and the quality of life of russian people but can also drastically change all our perceptions about modern warfare
198754 an arms race built around nano enabled weapons is more likely now than it was before
198755 however any sci tech development may be used for good and for harm rosnanotech said pointing out that they only specialize in the commercialization of nanotechnology
198756 the smallest pore size is the key to the strength of porous materials and what they can do
198757 seeing inside bulk porous materials has never been done before at this resolution making this one of the first applications of x ray diffractive microscopy to a real problem
198758 the strength and stiffness of foam like structures are expected to scale with their density relating the density of individual elements like beams and nodes to the overall density
198759 but below about 10 percent density the strength of aerogels like the ones we tested on the order of 1 percent density is orders of magnitude less than expected
198760 the high resolution we achieved allowed us to see which of these models more accurately described the actual observed structure
198761 the structure was far more complex than anything wed seen in earlier images obtained using this technique
198762 wed like to use x ray diffraction to study a range of porous materials and nanostructures in general for example porous polymers developed at the molecular foundry for storing hydrogen as fuel and at even higher resolutions
198763 to do so david shapiro who built the end station we used for this work is working with us to overcome some obstacles
198764 and after all this you can find out the sample was no good so you have to start over
198765 we are also collaborating with berkeley labs computational research division to develop efficient and robust algorithms to speed up the time needed to construct the 3 d image from the individual rotated views
198766 this will open an entire spectrum of possibilities for new ways of seeing the very small not just aerogels but virtually any unknown object from nanostructures to biological cells

198769 in a few years clocks will be able to monitor local changes of the earth gravitational potential by using relativity which might help us forecast tsunamis earthquakes or global climate warming
198770 by understanding it we can do new things such as build quantum computers that in the future could store and process far more information than ordinary computers and may outperform them in certain applications e g cracking the encryption commonly used to transmit information electronically
198771 i think our biggest challenge in the coming years is to bring together knowledge and entertainment and the speakers captivated the public here in barcelona
198772 we have clearly conveyed the fascination that the euroquam scientists have for the exciting fundamental phenomena and technological opportunities of ultra cold matter

198779 the landscaping component of this is one of the more important aspects of the plan the landscape will soften the visual impact of certain structures
198780 whats most interesting is how much the maintenance yard does to support this world renowned parks system they parks department employees have to be very creative in how they work and manage themselves
198781 im as interested as you are in whats going to happen to that hotel it was a big investment and its hard to know if it will pay off
198782 hotel developers have economic models for that but part of that is based on their own predictions of the market its also a risk and they could be nailed in part by the economic factors not really predictable after youve made your decision
198783 id like the economy to be stronger and the future to be more confident
198784 but if i have to open a hotel anywhere im glad its in portland
198785 theyre probably in a similar category to the benson and the heathman boutique historic properties but the nines is definitely pushing the envelope in terms of what theyre offering
198786 if theres a problem in question then we cant move forward with proposals or project work or anything if we have this dark cloud hanging over it
198787 i will say that filing this motion to appeal on both the river district motions will have a significant impact of the commissions operations and so we are concerned about being able to provide the kinds of things weve typically been able to do
198788 if the friends of urban renewal are strictly concerned that the satellite ura is unusual then theyve gone beyond that and filed on both motions
198789 we dont think theres any rationale at all for the ura expansion and extension
198790 and on and on it will go until say 2050 when if theyre lucky the last of the boomers will be living out their days in the young at heart chorus
198791 i cant describe how many educational and life experiences ive gotten out of the program because there are so many

198804 i am disappointed that john mccain flipped and changed his position i think in the past he had been opposed to these kinds of ward connerly referenda or initiatives as divisive and i think hes right you know the truth of the matter is these are not designed to solve a big problem but theyre all too often designed to drive a wedge between people
198805 i am a strong supporter of affirmative action when properly structured so that it is not just a quota but it is acknowledging and taking into account some of the hardships and difficulties that communities of color may have experienced continue to experience and it also speaks to the value of diversity in all walks of american life we are becoming a more diverse culture and its something that has to be acknowledged
198806 what a president should know but most learn too late

198809 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
198810 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
198811 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
198812 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
198813 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
198814 despite an image of decline more people today in more places read the content produced in the newsrooms of american daily newspapers than at any time in years
198815 when you heat the fastener you are going to drill anneal it and dont harden it
198816 if you anneal the material you are going to drill your drill wont have such a hard time trying to bite it and it will cut easier also though if you anneal it and it is truly stuck you will have a much harder time turning it out without it twisting or breaking off if you know it is a bolt that youll drill to the end anneal it if you will drill to the point of extraction with pliers or an extractor harden it
198817 use a carburizing flame and thoroughly coat the area to be annealed with a thin layer of carbon change to a neutral flame and heat the stud or bolt keeping the flame back from the part until the carbon is burned off walk away and have a coffee or something and let the part slowly cool to room temperature
198818 use a sharp bit and it will drill like iron if you are just going to grab a stud with your vise grips heat that baby to a bright red then cut your flame just as the red goes dull hit it with something to cool it such as water
198819 be sure to use the drill stops you dont want to drill deeper than the broken piece take your time and keep the drill speed and tip pressure at a point where you are cutting cleanly and steadily
198820 this will vary according to the type of stock being drilled hardened steel is tough every time
198821 were at the point where theres been a lot of commitments and a lot of talk about renewable energy
198822 now its time to roll up our sleeves and get dirty
198823 the replicability of it if you could do this at any site that has a public school it would create low cost low carbon forms of energy
198824 what you need to know here is that the right the wsj editorial page heritage etc hates hates hates fannie and freddie why because they dont want quasi public entities competing with angelo mozilo

198864 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
198865 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
198866 we consider cloud computing to be the model that can fundamentally change the current it market structure and create paradigm shifts
198867 to spread cloud computing in japan it is very meaningful that ibm has launched the first cloud computing center in japan at this time ns solutions research center will actively use this center and advocate cloud computing
198868 to develop high skilled human resources in the it field it is necessary to create the latest it environment for the education space
198869 kyushu university is very interested in cloud computing technology which can provide an on demand it environment to our students and teachers we have been working with ibm the pioneer of this field kyushu university will continue to take advantage of cloud computing technology more actively
198870 this announcement further demonstrates ibms commitment to our state and to our people
198871 i look forward to maintaining this partnership with ibm for years to come
198872 one night im gonna fuck that young and hot assistant and its going to happen in this room i cant drive you out so you can fall asleep soundly or stay silent and see everything but what you really should do is to keep your fucking mouth shut

198966 whats going on here we have a board member ready and eager to work the ideal volunteer in my experience but you wont cooperate with him can you please explain the problem to me
198967 and james could easily fill in the blank by a variety of reactions to maxs arm twisting of possible donors worse yet of long time donors
198968 of 3 million the largest this college has ever seen it seems like you would allow me to decide on naming opportunities in the new building
198969 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
198970 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
198971 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
198972 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering hes offering bush economic policies and karl rove politics
198973 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
198974 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
198975 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day
198976 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track
198977 nobody here thinks that bush or mccain has a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared about me
198978 im ready to duel john mccain on taxes right here quick draw
198979 if barack obama wants this so called duel then why did he and his entourage run for the hills when john mccain challenged him to 10 town halls
198980 he seems to be only talking about me you need to ask john mccain what hes for not just what hes against
198981 i would take his call now i will take his call when hes president any time remember no matter who is president i dont see this as a political thing i see this as we always have to help no matter what the administration is
198982 if obama is running around talking about change maybe this is the year of change
198983 this is our opportunity lets take the word change yes lets change the system in california because there needs to be change
198984 hes never been afraid to throw nominees under the bus
198985 in his own election in 06 you know he abandoned every republican on the ticket so the fact that hes wishy washy in his comments now is nothing new for him
198986 arnold doesnt like to back losers his whole career was based on being a winner and he doesnt put his money on long shots
198987 america is so addicted to oil that it will take years to wean ourselves from it

198989 both of the candidates are interested in looking for a plan and they are interested in solving global warming the problem they are strong on the environment
198990 they may have issues particularly on the offshore drilling issue but hes specifically said that difference of opinion is not driving him away from this endorsement
198991 that we dont agree on everything thats clear nor do i with my wife
198992 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
198993 so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
198994 thats not the debate were getting out of john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me you notice that i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that youre not real happy with them and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me so what theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new he doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency hes got a funny name i mean thats basically the argument hes too risky
198995 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me i mean you havent heard a positive thing out of that campaign in a month all they do is try to run me down and you know you know this in your own life right if somebody doesnt have anything nice to say about anybody that means theyve got some problems of their own so they know theyve got no new ideas they know theyre dredging up all the stale old stuff theyve been peddling for the last eight ten years but since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and theyre going to send out nasty e mails and the latest one they got me in an ad with paris hilton you know never met the woman but you know what theyre going to try to argue is that somehow im too risky you know basically what theyre saying to you is we know we didnt do a real good job but hes too risky
198996 obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
198997 playing the race card from the bottom of the deck
198998 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
198999 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me

199181 this result is a clear rejection of an inadequate offer our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
199182 inflation is at 4 6 per cent and key items on household bills like bread and milk are increasing even faster our members need a fair offer from their employers we have a window of opportunity to see if we can avoid disruptive strikes i hope the employers take it

199228 then in an election year he finally does the right thing in 2001 gordon smith voted with george w bush 93 percent of the time

199245 n o que o juiz como cidad o n o possa se pronunciar politicamente mas a partir do momento que o judici rio procura interferir na pol tica muito preocupante
199246 isso pode se encaminhar para uma ditadura do judici rio pelo pr prio peso que a magistratura tem na forma o da opini o p blica e hoje a magistratura com esse peso ela est criando na opini o p blica essa hostilidade advocacia a partir da argumenta o que a advocacia quer privil gios quando pretende que o presidente da rep blica sancione o projeto que apenas detalha a inviolabilidade dos escrit rios de advocacia e assegura o amplo direito de defesa

199252 the bearish fundamentals and technicals are reasserting themselves after a mid week rally
199253 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year and this week even an attack on nigerian pipelines or iran not giving answers about their nuclear program is not enough to provide sustained support

199268 to discuss any aspect of aligning the charter with the bbbee codes of good practice until the dispute around black ownership targets in the financial sector is resolved
199269 it echoes threats by the banking association over the past few months that the big four banks were considering pulling out of the charter unless they get their way on lower black ownership targets
199270 that we have gone as far as we can on discussions on a sector code and we need to resolve the ownership issue before completing discussions on this
199271 fuck off i have my constitutional rights i want some god damn sunflower seeds
199272 i dont know when ive ever been so happy in my life
199273 i never could have imagined it its something one dreams about being with the two of you after my childhood this seems like heaven i just wish everyone could experience what we have
199274 we may all be inside our own heads but we all share all of humanity shares reality
199275 dont each of us experience a slightly different reality isnt that what makes us unique and individual
199276 how are the articles that youre writing being received tyler
199277 theyre going so well that im submitting three a week now and they gave me a raise apparently everyone likes them
199278 were averaging about twenty one hundred dollars a day in sales of miracle elixir
199279 thats about six times as much as i make as a tenured professor
199280 maybe youre in the wrong profession honey child snake oil has always been a growth industry people just cant get enough of hucksters just think of yourself as a ppolitician
199281 im averaging around nineteen hundred dollars a day thats not including the two hundred thousand dollars nor the other big one of fifty thousand
199282 sounds like you can afford to pay for college yourself
199283 they can afford it besides they havent done a damn thing since ive been with you paid a few bills thats it they didnt even come to my graduation

199289 oh i thought id try something real original like bonnie the braying burra
199290 while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
199291 of course obama and his people have to condemn the rap because it does say some vulgar things
199292 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
199293 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
199294 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible
199295 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
199296 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
199297 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
199298 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
199299 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
199300 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
199301 there is a community of people who arent watching cnn or reading the life insurance made simple no medical examinations
199302 other than making it easier for us to count and to carry around our problems have not gone away
199303 its like we are pretending that things are getting normal when the truth is that they are doing this introducing the new currency because we are in a bad state and far from normality
199304 nationally an approximate 2 500 employees representing about 16 of telkoms workforce in the bargaining unit has heeded the call for industrial action by sacu the south african communications union and cwu the communication workers union as part of a planned industrial action from august 1 to 5

199306 the chinese government and the chinese people have been working in real earnest to honor the commitments made to the international community
199307 other questioning dates will be scheduled in the near future
199308 we have decided to move forward with a number of our productions and address any issues later as they arise
199309 everyone is working under the assumption that nothing will happen until there is an election and the results are known
199310 i think sag thought lets drag this into july and august lets force the studios to make a mistake maybe theyll impose maybe theyll lock us out and that will galvanize the members and then well get a strike vote that didnt happen
199311 its a two way street the amptp knows where to find us
199312 i think two issues are going to overshadow what both sides want to do one is the lingering feeling from the beef demonstrations and then this more recent territorial dispute over the dokdo islands
199313 we have been informed that 16 students died and 27 were injured we think that there are still four or six more children under the rubble
199314 i was in the part of the building which didnt collapse with five of my friends immediately after the explosion and we felt flames rising from the downstairs to upper floors
199315 who seeks such an approach is really seeking a religious war
199316 when the muslims came here they never found any standing building or any culture still alive so they never threatened any standing building
199317 we are not going to entertain theories about buildings that may or may not have been here before
199318 its difficult to approach a gate while passing through cemeteries through graves
199319 after the blocking of the gate and people stop using the gate people made use of the area by burying their dead
199320 you cannot expect us to allow in everyone when palestinians from just outside jerusalem cannot come here and pray
199321 tell me during the last five years in jerusalem what riots do we have in this area
199322 censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
199323 if olympic hosts are permitted to curtail and manipulate information available to the games global audience that breach of trust will inevitably undermine the credibility of the olympics itself
199324 china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games this has yet to happen

199567 lo que no puede ocurrir es que el gobierno se vanaglorie porque tiene un 35 por ciento de chilenos que es v ctima de delitos graves y porque se ofenda y terminemos con esa arrogancia infinita que consiste en no ser capaz de aceptar que hay pa ses vecinos que pueden hacer las cosas mejor que nosotros y aprendamos de ellos

199578 for starters we need to beat drogheda once we do that well be thinking of our next opponents
199579 we could have faced the likes of juventus fc barcelona or liverpool fc

199608 a small number of users of p2p file sharing applications served by a particular cell site could severely degrade the service quality enjoyed by all customers

199790 he for political purposes has to separate himself from anything controversially black
199791 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
199792 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
199793 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
199794 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
199795 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
199796 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen
199797 i am pleased to announce that the company has reported another full year of strong sales growth delivered against a backdrop of challenging market conditions
199798 s lo puedo mostrarte el p rtico eres tu quien debe atravesarlo
199799 and then he added it is what comes from inside that defiles you for from within out of a persons heart come evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder adultery greed wickedness deceit lustful desires envy slander pride and foolishness
199800 do you know whats better than getting something that you really want
199801 whenever you choose to make decisions for yourself you are thinking destructively and the decision will be wrong 2 it will hurt you because of the concept of decision that led to it 3 it is not true that you can make decisions by yourself or for yourself alone 4 no thought of gods son can be separate or isolated in its effects 5 every decision is made for the whole sonship directed in and out and influencing a constellation larger than anything you ever dreamed of
199802 before you make any decisions for yourself remember that you have decided against your function in heaven and then consider carefully whether you want to make decisions here 2 your function here is only to decide against deciding what you want in recognition that you do not know 3 how then can you decide what you should do 4 leave all decisions to the one who speaks for god and for your function as he knows it 5 so will he teach you to remove the awful burden you have laid upon yourself by loving not the son of god and trying to teach him guilt instead of love 6 give up this frantic and insane attempt that cheats you of the joy of living with your god and father and of waking gladly to his love and holiness that join together as the truth in you making you one with him
199803 our emphasis has been on bringing what is undesirable to the desirable what you do not want to what you do 2 you will realize that salvation must come to you this way if you consider what dissociation is 3 dissociation is a distorted process of thinking whereby two systems of belief which cannot coexist are both maintained 4 if they are brought together their joint acceptance becomes impossible 5 but if one is kept in darkness from the other their separation seems to keep them both alive and equal in their reality 6 their joining thus becomes the source of fear for if they meet acceptance must be withdrawn from one of them p287 7 you cannot have them both for each denies the other 8 apart this fact is lost from sight for each in a separate place can be endowed with firm belief 9 bring them together and the fact of their complete incompatibility is instantly apparent 10 one will go because the other is seen in the same place
199804 in this world you can become a spotless mirror in which the holiness of your creator shines forth from you to all around you 2 you can reflect heaven here 3 yet no reflections of the images of other gods must dim the mirror that would hold gods reflection in it 4 earth can reflect heaven or hell god or the ego 5 you need but leave the mirror clean and clear of all the images of hidden darkness you have drawn upon it 6 god will shine upon it of himself 7 only the clear reflection of himself can be perceived upon it
199805 i do not know what anything including this means 8 and so i do not know how to respond to it 9 and i will not use my own past learning as the light to guide me now
199806 hi pr woman told me to give you a call to reschedule i waited by the phone at 9 a m for you to call then i get this message in a meeting from pr woman to call you back here i am im home all weekend
199807 the rogen has been pumping out the hits recently and i found them funny and relevant to my age bordering 30
199808 i dont know for what cause someone would make such a long run out of the same exact movies
199809 what i appreciate about tropic thunder is that it is ben stiller in spoof mode
199810 im bored of him as a victim of circumstances who mugs his advance through humiliation posterior humbling
199811 downey was so good in the role that suddenly everyone loves him
199812 pineapple express is up in that place with the big lebowski and sean penn in fast times at ridgemont high
199813 good stoner fun its superbad seven years older with the identical friendship idea you get the feeling these men will not grow up ever
199814 its ben stiller at his smartest laughing at hollywood and himself with cruise dropped in the middle with his peak deed
199815 the hard r is directed at teenage boys of all ages
199816 it says this isnt going to be safe they push it to the limit
199817 it opened up the door for films to again tackle political issues
199818 when hollywood dealt with war directly after all the rest declension it alienated audiences
199819 now comedies are starting to deal with general concerns outside of family and romance like sandlers you dont mess through the zohan and harold amp kumar escape from guantanamo we can laugh at the mania
199820 if you make people laugh and think they like it you can exist pungent about being stupid people will let you get away through more
199821 they went to juno over knocked up they are looking for novelty
199822 comedy used to be more about characters who were fish out of water or just spell
199823 now they are dealing with the reality at hand being more true to the situation
199824 it was a time when all actors were going away to fake boot camp and talking about these incredible experiences that they had and how it really changed their lives there was something there that seemed funny to me
199825 we should then at least have frolic with it since were going to have to be an r
199826 i was watching true romance on laser disc thats how long past it was
199827 i always thought brad pitt was hilarious playing a crackhead and wished the guys were chasing him instead i thought about potheads who think it is harmless to smoke it and it would be funny on the supposition that leaders of a pot cartel were as murderous as coke dealers
199828 its fun to see a cheech and chong film with jerry bruckheimer action
199829 based on what were seeing on our message boards and all over the web the murmur on both of these titles is really high
199830 its going to be that end of summer last huzza for moviegoers many will see pineapple express which will probably be no 1 that weekend and then turn around and see tropic thunder the next a one two punch
199831 theres a little bit of a tie up on the runway but viewed like a comedy fan theres nothing better on earth than to acquire this many
199832 shall i simply bend over to make it easier for you
199833 to demonstrate i have just done this in order to show you that
199834 i thought it would earn made in the van of i even cogitation near to construction it
199835 i think enough fit seasons gone by and the million are realising where watchmen sits in the landscape of comic books
199836 now its in the manner of were dealing with sacred pages where judgment it was fine to put arnold schwarzenegger in the movie
199837 but all those things have come together and made me able to go these pages are sacred we need to do it like this
199838 its simply the greatest comic ever written its that simple
199839 theres a thing with watchmen that scares the s t out of you at the sort time as it excites you but weve all taken a blood oath that were not going to f k it up
199840 the amount of energy i expend is equal to the size of the check
199841 when you cant control it pretend you were never in charge
199842 oh honey i can help you improve your business so much
199843 oh yes id love for you to steal my clients
199844 it was to be expected that the levels of ivas would reduce i think the reasons for this are twofold firstly some insolvency practitioners ips are still not using the new iva protocol and are therefore finding that more and more ivas are being rejected by creditors strict criteria
199845 secondly although we have experienced the so called credit crunch for a year now i believe that we are still in the calm before the storm in terms of its effects it can take a while for a person with
199846 however i believe that this reduction will be short lived as the credit crunch really takes hold in the second half of 2008
199847 i also predict that the level of bankruptcies will increase over the next six months which does worry me
199848 one prevalent area not covered in these statistics is the level of more informal debt management plans which can be offered by providers who are not qualified ips i suspect that the levels of debt management plans would have shown a significant increase this quarter
199849 the worsening economy is hitting people where it hurts their finances
199850 this is the time for the debt management industry to respond to the market helping people with serious financial difficulties to get back onto their financial feet again
199851 individuals with serious levels of debt need access to ips who specialise in non lending solutions and can offer innovative solutions
199852 february saw the launch of the new iva protocol which will lead to better standards and more accountability by ips it should give creditors more confidence that the iva is being used appropriately and will also result in creditors getting returns quicker than before it is vital that creditors have faith in the iva process in order to turn wont pay cant pay debtors into will pay can pay ones
199853 ips need to have faith in the changes set out in the new protocol not turn their backs on them
199854 el objetivo de cualquier racionalidad el fin de los medios para dominar a la naturaleza ser a precisamente algo que ya no es medio que ya no es racional

199862 over the years i have never heard anything negative from his teammates
199863 officially the dodgers acquired ramirez in a three team trade that cost them third base prospect andy laroche and pitcher bryan morris who worked in class a
199864 manny ramirez the greta garbo of baseball who despised the fishbowl of boston should like this
199865 ultimately this trade is a demonstration of how badly boston wanted to get rid of manny
199866 when manny comes up you feel like you have to pass out ex lax to your whole team because everybody gets a sick feeling in their stomach look jason bay is a great player
199867 at the end of the day there is each order that mr ainsworth infringed our copyright and the next stage of the case will be discussing remedies for that

199884 finding adequate appropriate medical care in foreign lands can be daunting but travelers who prepare before their trip can give themselves peace of mind
199885 you have a giftcard to caribou offer it to her maybe she can get a sandwich or two with it
199886 the presence of a linear field of geothermal features is evidence of a planar rift extending to considerable depth in the crust
199887 water and gas co2 mostly coming up from below the surface must have a source
199888 it is usually associated with an opening in the crust that reaches down to a magma body relatively close to the surface like yellowstone the fact that the mud pots and mud volcanoes line up indicates a fault the fact that they line up with the end of the san andreas fault suggests that the two are connected somehow
199889 i was not looking for a fault i was simply studying the mud pots
199890 when i noticed the alignment i knew it meant something probably a fault a few days later i plotted up the pots and noticed that they lined up with the accepted end of the san andreas fault thats when i got excited and contacted ken hudnut
199891 uitrukken is erg duur en bovendien kan het gebeuren dat we dan bij een echt noodgeval niet paraat staan
199892 de film is onevenwichtig en geeft een onjuist beeld van de wetenschappelijke consensus die er is over de rol van de mens bij de opwarming van de aarde
199893 critici die dat ontkennen brengen de planeet in gevaar en daarmee de levens van de huidige en toekomstige generaties
199894 they have come to the end of their power and the world is on the verge of entering a new promising era
199895 the rich and powerful countries continue to exercise an inordinate influence in determining the nature and direction of international relations including economic and trade relations as well as rules governing these relations many of which are at the expense of developing countries
199896 unilaterally imposed measures by certain states the use and threat of use of force and pressure and coercive measures as a means to achieving their national policy objectives
199897 the categorization of countries as good or evil based on unilateral and unjustified criteria
199898 sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of a political nature and should be promptly removed
