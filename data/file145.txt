1450003 when he thought hard his face scrunched up his eyes narrowed into a squint when he figured something out he sometimes seemed to talk to himself smile shake his head with pleasure when he made a mistake too impatient to lay down his slate pencil he twisted his forearm towards his body in a single fluid motion and used his elbow now aimed at the slate as an eraser

1450009 i dont necessarily believe that just because somebody is born with a vagina that means thats a woman
1450010 or somebody who is born with a penis is automatically a man i dont think that i was born in the wrong body i just think that there are women with penises and men with vaginas
1450011 i cant tell you enough about the work that gwen s done on our behalf and what a difficult job it is i work on that website for half a day and im bawling my eyes out just looking at their faces all these young people with all the promise in the world and their lives were just snuffed out for no other reason than they were trans or different were being murdered at an enormous rate
1450012 i fight for hate crime legislation inclusion because one exists and whenever were removed from it or kept from being put in it it puts a target on our behind
1450013 my ideal target audience isnt really just transgender people or lgbt people
1450014 its people who dont know anything about us id love for people to tune in that dont know anything about trans issues so that they can get to hear it first hand im really tired of people speaking for us and not knowing what theyre talking about
1450015 its like well of course you should be covered in employment nondiscrimination or of course you should be protected from being abused physically and murdered
1450016 weve all suffered loses or have experienced hate crimes directly in our families or personally any family that needs help can contact anyone of us
1450017 a bunch of rabble rousers telling it like it is saying the things other organizations are afraid to say and wont say about whats actually happening in our community
1450018 wont even tolerate supporters of hrc i dont believe theyre helping anybody never mind trans people what theyve done to us their board made an educated decision to not support us it pains me to see them grab people out of our community that dont know the history its the people that know better that im really talking about when i say i dont tolerate that this is our community why would you do that to your own people
1450019 we got kicked to the curb in the 80s when the assimilationist movement started and rich white gay men decided this was their movement
1450020 and every other state that has already taken care of their community as far as employment and hate crimes are concerned
1450021 i just want rights like everybody else i want us all to have rights
1450022 didnt remember our community without the t and couldnt understand or fathom the idea of one of those letters being lobbed off for the sake of expediency
1450023 i dont think one ought to bring a clearly disabled child into the world
1450024 the board has expressed its support for rick wagoner and the gm management team on several occasions and that has not changed
1450025 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1450026 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern

1450032 i heard that he told people that if he couldnt have her dowdell he was going to kill her
1450033 while in the pen with the tigers one of the tigers jumped on the victim and knocked him to the ground
1450034 at that point two other tigers joined in the attack and drug the victim to a water pool

1450053 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed

1450062 we will forge ahead and do this with some extra time this is the right time for her to be moving on

1450065 peter and i have had to do a lot of gym work as you have to throw the boat round the course
1450066 muscle and weight is very important in the star class
1450067 its quite a heavy boat and you have to be strong to sail it
1450068 very happy with how we are prepared and how the boat is going
1450069 there is a lot of swell in china and not a lot of breeze maybe two or three knots and a lot of tide so conditions are very different from anything any of us have really sailed in
1450070 we have spent a lot of time getting the boat set up the way we like it but it has been worth the effort
1450071 the fact that we are competing at the olympics will only set in when we see the thousands of people at the opening ceremony
1450072 having said that we have sailed against all the guys we are sailing against before and we know them all personally so we will not be meeting strangers out there
1450073 the sailing will definitely be up a level and tactics in sailing have changed
1450074 it is going to be very exciting although i imagine the nerves will be bad at the start
1450075 a big adrenaline rush to see 119 sails behind you and a great feeling when you are doing well in a race
1450076 you have to get your tactics right though as it can all go wrong very quickly and you can be looking at 119 sails in front of you rather than behind you

1450084 i will continue on and with greater commitment i have a task to do and im going to do it
1450085 after witnessing that we felt the crusade was not in jeopardy and that it was only going to be strengthened by what happened
1450086 its usually a pretty full event but i imagine this year it will be even more full if such a thing is possible
1450087 finding faith the spiritual quest of the post boomer generation
1450088 people are going to want to come and hear what he says
1450089 i think theres a resonance there that hell be able to tap into between his recent family experience and evangelical theology i miss chris i love him but i know where he is in heaven
1450090 i think it will be particularly poignant that greg will be able to stand up and realize that those people were in those seats because they were given an invitation that chris had designed
1450091 life is brief and can be taken from us at any moment
1450092 around southern california hes ubiquitous hes a regional star with appeal
1450093 to not acknowledge it will be almost to dishonor christophers life and his role in the crusade
1450094 sure that would always cross our mind when we think about it
1450095 but then we have to go back and ask ourselves what would chris want done this is what his life was about helping communicate this message
1450096 i have this unbelievably strong feeling that him sitting beside stacy had something to do with this
1450097 its a great ruling for the teachers and the state employees
1450098 it essentially says the government cant use the pension fund as a rainy day fund
1450099 instead of seeking a tax increase or cuts in other state programs that did not enjoy special constitutional protection defendants diverted the employer contributions to the retirement system
1450100 keeps retirement funds where they should be with retirees who have dedicated their careers to serving the public

1450104 most analogies drawn from the physical realm tend to be either tritheistic or modalistic in their implications
1450105 sow a thought you reap an action sow an action you reap a habit sow a habit you reap a character sow a character and you reap a destiny
1450106 the art of conscious creation how you can transform the world
1450107 that the church is both central and peripheral in the new testament
1450108 for some the adjective evangelical belongs to those who read the bible with a special kind of respect some of them consider me as fitting in that realm
1450109 i would gladly admit ligon duncan or sinclair ferguson or r c sproul or philip ryken to membership at bethlehem if i were allowed by our constitution and in doing so i would not be giving up my view on the proper nature of baptism
1450110 a lot of us evangelical arminians agree with them in their criticisms of popular folk religion
1450111 i agree with their basic theological underpinnings that doctrine is important that grace is the decisive factor in salvation not a decision we make
1450112 it is a nickname to call it calvinism calvinism is the gospel and nothing else
1450113 but piper and friends see theological kinship even with others who disagree with them about baptism and other polity issues

1450119 michael frost a friend of mine was recently privy to a meeting with three chinese leaders from the underground church who were smuggled out to a group of western leaders about issues they were facing
1450120 before going to china i met with one of the missionaries who had been expelled in 1950
1450121 our relationship with each other is the criterion the world uses to judge whether our message is truthful christian community is the final apologetic
1450122 it is not allowable to love the creation according to the purposes one has for it any more than it is allowable to love ones neighbor in order to borrow his tools
1450123 all wars are civil wars because all men are brothers each one owes infinitely more to the human race than the particular country in which he was born
1450124 the paradox of hospitality is that it wants to create emptiness not a fearful emptiness but a friendly emptiness where strangers can enter and discover themselves as free free to sing their own songs speak their own languanges dance their own dances free also to leave and follow their own vocations
1450125 ministry cannot be about maintenance but it is about gathering about embrace about welcoming home all sorts of and conditions of people home is a place for mother tongue of basic soul food of old stories told and treasured of being at ease known by name belonging without qualifying for membership
1450126 many poets are not poets for the same reason that many religious men are not saints they never succeed in being themselves they never get round to being the particular poet or particular monk that they are intended to be by god
1450127 in order to become myself i must cease to be what i always thought i wanted to be
1450128 god spoke to balaam through his ass and gods been speaking through them ever since
1450129 we must become holy not because we want to feel holy but because christ must be able to live his life fully in us
1450130 people have gotten off so lightly with a small fine so that i think the fact that somebody is being sent to jail in addition to the 1 000 fine should send a very strong message
1450131 its causing people the retailers who are on margin thin profits to not be able to sustain themselves and theyre going out of business
1450132 the landlords arent cutting the rents and the retailers if theyre not making their numbers theyre not going to be able to survive
1450133 there was a recent report that just came out that hotel occupancy is at 69 percent statewide thats scary because normally an average hotel to make money has to be in the mid 70s to 80s range

1450139 how to minister effectively in family pastoral program and corporate sized churches
1450140 i am sure someone has told you that you shouldnt change anything when you go to a new church for at least a year
1450141 well forget it dont change anything in a new church unless you become convinced that it needs changing change anything you think that needs changing and anything you think you can change without the laity killing you lots of churches are filled with laity who are languishing there desperate for a pastor to go ahead and change something for the better lots of times we pastors blame our cowardice or our lack of vision on the laity saying that we want to change something but we cant because of the laity we ought to just go ahead and change something and then see what the consequences are

1450154 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1450155 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1450156 they are trying to get the value they think is reasonably in its various parts
1450157 were the same three jerks we always were im actually quite proud of the fact that its gone on as long as it has
1450158 im in front of the stage and you literally see people break out into sobs or kiss each other and jump around expressing joy
1450159 when he exercises his right to have it the way he imagined it its a problem for both him and me
1450160 i just cant do it i cant remember it i have my own ideas im incorrigible
1450161 but not really to the extent where we were able to clear up all of our misconceptions about each other
1450162 it was really good for us to figure out what made the band work and what didnt work so we could appreciate each other unconfused by these other issues
1450163 we are the mighty police and we are totally at sea
1450164 as were getting more into it and less uptight about living the legend it is actually becoming the stuff that got us here
1450165 im fully prepared to say that was it were fine and were done
1450166 on the other hand im fully prepared if someone comes back in a couple of years and says we ought to give it a go you have to consider it
1450167 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that
1450168 sen obama is an impressive speaker and the beauty of his words has attracted many people especially among the young to his campaign
1450169 i applaud his talent and his success my concern with sen obama is that on big issues and small issues what he says and what he does are often two different things and that he doesnt seem to understand that the policies he offers would make our problems harder not easier to solve
1450170 my opponent is a great speaker and he has been able to motivate millions of young people including defeating a very formidable candidate in the form of sen hillary clinton
1450171 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much and thats the problem with washington its not just the bush administration and its not just the democratic congress its that everyone in washington says whatever it takes to get elected or score the political points of the day
1450172 if sen obama doesnt have the strength to speak openly and directly about how he will address the serious challenges confronting america how will he be strong enough to really change washington we dont need another politician in washington who puts self interest and political expediency ahead of problem solving
1450173 its beyond dispute that he has become the biggest celebrity in the world
1450174 the more serious point i think for our supporters is that despite the size of his crowds celebrity and curiosity and fans theres nothing to be intimidated by as the underdog campaign
1450175 as the underdog campaign sometimes our crowds arent 200 000 strong and roaring but that its just a different approach and style and imagery and were holding our own
1450176 she said no im coming up to support you because shes fearless that woman
1450177 she came up and we knew that the children had no food because i couldnt get in because it was blockaded and too dangerous
1450178 this does not mean that we withdraw all our authorities from the preah vihear area our border authorities and temple security guards remain there as before
1450179 anyway what is important is that the two government representatives have already shown their goodwill in solving this border problem through peaceful means however there still remain more details to be resolved as i said yesterday with two solutions
1450180 and as i already pointed out the cambodian thai border is 830 kilometre long but we have only 73 border markers
1450181 we leave the time for the government to think of the formation of a new government but it does not mean that we have closed the door completely however as the top leaders have already been in agreement details should be left for technical teams to deal with as such it is not like the local newspapers and bangkok post said it is over for now
1450182 at first we regret that thailand has sent more troops to ta moan temple however although thailand has claimed that the temple is in its territory and we claim that it is ours we already said that the 2000 memorandum of understanding has determined that we will discuss the border problem peacefully with compromise the troop reinforcements show that thailand does not keep its words and it is not the manners of a civilized country having diplomatic relations with the others
1450183 very far different from it and not that valuable it is only an ordinary temple
1450184 as the temple is a dispute area it is impossible for thailand to make the inclusion maybe the thai official does not understand what to do to include a site in the world heritage list perhaps it is just his hint or he does not understand anything at all however we think that normally that cannot be done

1450188 what i can say is that capoeira involves not only kicks and punches but some acrobatic movements as well it is a type of martial art that was created by the slaves in brazil in their fight for freedom so its very aggressive and at the same time graceful
1450189 a lot of them do capoeira or have done it in the past
1450190 then after they get into mma they stop doing it but definitely a lot of mma guys have done it
1450191 and i always saw the older guys fighting in the roda and that impressed me a lot
1450192 i never thought about it professionally but when i was young i always had fights in capoeira rodas against bigger or stronger guys and i did good
1450193 that was the time i realized i could really do this
1450194 he not only gave me inspiration as a fighter but he was the one who opened the doors for me into the big leagues and that took me to the ufc
1450195 they dont pressure me and they let me do what want in the beginning they didnt like it very much my father is an engineer and my mom is a lawyer so they didnt understand why i wanted to fight but now they are cool with it and they support me all the way
1450196 and now its even tougher since a lot of good guys jumped to the 205 pound division im happy enough just to be in the mix with all those good fighters and im just a kid compared to all those good guys there but im growing and i do train hard my thing is to fight one fight at the time and then time will tell where my place in this division is
1450197 he has good strikes as well as takedowns and i think its going to be a good match

1450215 as were getting more into it and less uptight about living the legend it is actually becoming the stuff that got us here

1450523 i was also told most oddly that by subjecting my kid to suburban life and suburban schools shed get no exposure to people from other cultures
1450524 seriously if the only exposure to other people your kid gets is when shes sitting in a place where you move about like cattle at the sound of a bell and have to ask permission to go to the bathroom i e school what kind of sheltered life are you giving your kid
1450525 look diversity is great when it comes to nightclubs workplaces cultural experiences restaurants and all that but i dont want diversity in my neighborhood

1450539 the thing about this research is that this work has confirmed that our economy based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood is destroying the social fabric of america
1450540 this system is based on a stacked deck where the top elites always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the corporate profits based system
1450541 the research confirmed that the rowing inequities of such a system were ever increasing and with them elevated social tensions
1450542 despite all the reports shortcomings and its hypocrisy it does make some sound observations about what is needed for our immediate survival we should take it as a guide to what our government knows about the coming mega crisis and a template to help us see what changes we could make if there were truly a new economy a new social contract a new american state for it is obvious to all those who take the time to look that we are headed into a period of national freefall when american society plunges head first into a dark abyss of uncertainty as the old order passes away and the new world order rushes in to fill the void we are seeing the planned collapse of america coming down the road we are on what are we going to do to get our nation off that highway to hell

1450616 it is worth noting that separation resulting from sectarian cleansing was not the chief cause of the reduction in violence as some have claimed much of iraq remains intermingled but increasingly peaceful and whereas a cleansing argument implies that casualties should have gone down in baghdad for example as mixed neighborhoods were cleansed casualties actually went up consistently during the sectarian warfare of 2006 cleansing may have reduced the violence somewhat in some places but it was not the main cause
1450617 if an electoral crisis or some other event returns iraq to civil war it would be very hard to justify another troop surge to try to stabilize iraq containment withdrawing all u s troops while working to prevent the chaos in iraq from spilling over to the rest of the region would then become the united states only realistic option

1450698 i read the news everyday and the amount of depressing information i get everyday really brings down my mood however posipeople shows that our world today is not as gloomy as it seems it helps me feel good about the world we are living in while also providing tips on how we can help make it better i tend to be a negative person but posipeople has helped me be more uplifting and now i can always see the good in things
1450699 posipeople is more than just good news it is a place where i can read and learn about best in class solutions to some of societys most challenging problems public charities spent nearly 1 trillion dollars in 2007 solving these challenges and the mainstream media is almost completely oblivious to the enormous impact that many of these charities are having many of these entrepreneurs are so absorbed in their work to improve others lives that they dont have time nor want to promote themselves people who enjoy and are good at promoting these entrepreneurs now have a venue to do so and the general public now has a one stop location where they can get real content and commentary about sincere smart people making real impact
1450700 i like to read about the people out there who have inspirational stories to tell and who do great things to care for the environment and others posipeople gathers all of these stories and it is the one place i visit often for the upbeat kind of content that i think the internet needs more of
1450701 posipeople is a great online resource for anyone who wants to find out more about the things that make a positive impact in our communities

1450704 martyrdom is a circumlocution of sorts for the quite personal and fatal consequences of the ontological collision between the kingdom of god and the kingdoms of this world as a collision of kingdoms martyrdom is and always has been rife with political overtones and as contemporary martyrs have shown seldom is it neat around the edges on a clearly reasoned yet sophisticated theological foundation bonhoeffer freely brought his faith into the polis brought his confession into action entering into solidarity with and sacrificing himself for the jews of the holocaust and thus like jesus he laid down his life for others i conclude therefore that bonhoeffer deserves to be styled a true martyr of the church
1450705 for rulers hold no terror for those who do right but for those who do wrong do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority then do what is right and he will commend you 4for he is gods servant to do you good but if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword for nothing he is gods servant an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer 5therefore it is necessary to submit to the authorities not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience
1450706 for it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of god 20but how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it
1450707 this reflection is helpful in that it directs attention away from the subjective intentions feelings and alleged motives of potential martyrs
1450708 it is absolutely critical to state at this point that if marketing is permitted we fully expect that additional cases of pml many likely to be fatal will occur

1450715 god is free not as one who could do otherwise but as the one above all who can do no other self bound to one sole way of being god is committed necessarily but thus freely to the cognate course of action gods lordship in bowing to the contradiction of the godless cross and godforsaken grace does not reside as barth occasionally and illogically asserts in a prior self sufficiency and secure immutability but as he more often understood and later followers more emphatically underscored in the uncoerced impulse to self consistency loves determination not to be deflected from its purposes but to flourish and perfect itself through willing self surrender what judges us as burdensome imperative illuminates god as free but binding indicative the truth for our creator and therefore for ourselves that only one who gives up life discovers and fulfills it on such a basis alone can we understand how the cross and grave truly reveal gods inmost triune life

1450726 a father is one who has infused his own spirit into others who actuates and governs their minds one who stands in a fathers place and looks after another in a paternal way it is a title of honor of elders seniors advanced in age teachers as those to whom pupils trace back the knowledge and training they have received it was used to designate the members of the sanhedrin whose prerogative it was by virtue of the wisdom and experience in which they excelled to take charge of the interests of others
1450727 god is called the father of the stars the heavenly luminaries because he is their creator upholder and ruler he is father of all rational and intelligent beings whether angels or men because he is their creator preserver guardian and protector he is father of spiritual beings and of all men and of christians in particular as those who through christ have been exalted to a specially close and intimate relationship with him and who no longer dread him as a stern judge of sinners but revere him as their reconciled and loving father he is the father of jesus christ as one whom god has united to himself in the closest bond of love and intimacy made acquainted with his purposes appointed to explain and carry out among men the plan of salvation and made to share also in his own divine nature
1450728 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth and you fathers do not provoke your children to wrath but bring them up in the training and admonition of the lord

1450761 losing personal data can take a heavy financial and emotional toll in various ways
1450762 for example state treasuries estimate that approximately 7 out of 10 families have unclaimed assets or money waiting for them because they are unaware of bank or brokerage accounts or other property that a relative did not document approximately 35 billions dollars each year turn into unclaimed government assets instead of being deposited into the bank accounts of american families this cant happen when such information is captured in the life management system

1450774 i saw it within a foot of me that child was dead
1450775 the child was purple with swelled eyes and swelled black lips
1450776 i was hysterical and someone came up to me and said look at her shes up

1450788 we had 10 basketball teams five on five three on three and a dunk competition
1450789 it was very successful a lot of teenagers in the neighbourhood look forward to this years tournament
1450790 parents are invited to come and watch their kids perform on stage
1450791 instead of turning to crime the kids develop their artistic skills
1450792 the festival gives youth the possibility to be part of a positive show all activities encourage them to use their energy constructively
1450793 as an artist co ordinating the event is the perfect job for me
1450794 our goal is to teach kids fundamentals that will stay with them and our low student teacher ratio allows us to tailor instruction to each students skill level
1450795 the goal of this event is to show people that tennis is a fun sport
1450796 its not about winning and being competitive its about having a good time playing the sport you love
1450797 this event is a great opportunity for young people to try out professional gear that they might not be able to afford
1450798 the tourn e sports experts is an attempt to democratise tennis and make it accessible to everyone
1450799 the kids are having a great time im happy that all my students showed up for the event
1450800 my three eldest are enrolled in tennis classes and practice three days a week in somerled park i think its important for them to be outside and be active
1450801 i think since 1990 that ive been on council this has been a project that has come close and then faltered
1450802 we need to accommodate for competitive swimming for leisure and a year around aquatics program where people can exercise whether its seniors or children
1450803 where people can come with their families on a weekend and participate
1450804 we are sorely lacking in an aquatic centre and in an intergenerational facility
1450805 and at that point we need to consider a variety of factors with respect to the project itself including the proper location the proper use of the building we right now have a good idea what it is wed like to build but we need to make sure the quebec government gives us the money first
1450806 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against

1450811 without a flashing sign or some kind of warning which is very visible to the automobile as it approaches the crosswalk the crosswalk becomes dangerous for certain people because many drivers dont respect them
1450812 i think its absolutely necessary that you have either flashing lights or as you pointed out push button lights some way of warning in advance
1450813 quebecers seem to have very little knowledge of pedestrian rights crossing at crosswalks including marked crosswalks if theres one area where we might start its there
1450814 i dont think the police give enough tickets for crosswalks
1450815 i believe too few drivers stop ive talked to some who have and they tell me well im afraid to stop at the crosswalks because the car behind is going to smash into me its because quebecers are not used to doing that
1450816 the reason we did that was not to have an annual ball but having said that when we actually had the ball we realized people were very taken by the idea of having a veterans ball
1450817 in the past there was a negative connotation to war but its about the fact that people choose to put themselves in harms way so citizens or society can have a better life thats how were talking at it
1450818 a lot of people enjoyed it and the board decided to make it an annual event
1450819 were hoping to make the event a bit bigger this year
1450820 they all benefit from what the foundation can give to us

1450823 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families

1450828 as a professional athlete a part of the job is inspiring and educating other women in some cases that goes beyond the bike

1450831 benjamin is a powerful sprinter and in this year she could certainly deliver the win
1450832 when you can combine your passion with helping achieve the greater good its an easy choice
1450833 when you participate on your bike or sponsor events that initiate change in the world it becomes something more than a fun race or good marketing opportunity it has a very real impact on the lives of women and their families as sponsors were able to reach beyond the boundaries of the cycling community and deliver a message of hope

1450839 we strongly urge both parties to seriously address the culture of physical inactivity in this country that has led to epidemic levels of obesity and chronic disease
1450840 not only have sedentary lifestyles taken a tragic toll on americans health but it also has driven up the cost of healthcare to all time highs prevention must be a priority in both party platforms if we are to curb the cost of treating chronic diseases that inevitably arise when too many americans lead sedentary lives
1450841 ihrsa is urging the democratic and republican parties to adopt policies that will encourage americans to be more physically active in order to reduce both the incidence of chronic disease and national healthcare costs
1450842 these policies should be part of a comprehensive program of preventive healthcare
1450843 more than sixty percent of americans fail to engage in the levels of physical activity that would bring them important health benefits
1450844 if more americans exercised regularly wed have lower levels of chronic disease in this country we could better management diseases once they do occur and as a country wed benefit from substantial savings in healthcare costs

1450852 these constituents have the intelligence and they should have the free will to do this there are three candidates vying for the opportunity to serve but with this resolution this body is taking it upon itself to personally eliminate one of these candidates
1450853 citizen participation in key decisions is critical to our democracy
1450854 citizen input into this critical decision was too little too late and seemingly not taken too seriously by pse amp g it is the job of our elected officials be they democratic or republican to ensure citizen participation and i pledge to do better for this district if elected in november
1450855 i am not sure whether garretts main priority is standing with his constituents or standing with his hand out waiting for his next campaign contribution from pse amp g
1450856 garrett has reported receiving five significant financial contributions from pse amp g including as recently as may has he received more during the past five weeks we need a member of congress who will do more than offer up vague words of support for citizen participation the citizens of sussex and warren are entitled to results and a process that takes their input seriously dennis will be the type of congressman who makes sure that happens

1450922 u s officials believe the elections initially scheduled for october are necessary for iraqs long term stability sunni arabs formerly the countrys elite boycotted the last such elections in january 2005 leading to the creation of provincial councils dominated by shiite muslims and kurds the absence of sunni muslims from local government helped strengthen the sunni led insurgency across central and northern iraq the stalemate emphasized the fissurges and entrenched positions among arabs turkmens and kurds in northern iraq which often threatens to spill over into violence

1450943 we are confident the fun and inspiring entries in this campaign will generate increased awareness for both ebay and
1450944 crazies who do not have a life of their own and so insist on ruining the lives of others
1450945 i am thrilled to be part of this marriage between pastry and mixology
1450946 like a luxury cocktail the macaroon is a delicacy an art form renowned for its sublime flavor vivid color and unique texture grand marnier has long been a treasured ingredient to my trade but the incorporation of the cocktail element is something completely new which we are proud to debut
1450947 weve thrown out the rule book in mixology and have embraced creativity on an entirely new scale
1450948 the cocktail macaroon delivers the fine character of a grand marnier cocktail in a stylish original way which both epicureans and cocktail connoisseurs can enjoy
1450949 this past year has seen significant milestones for the uxb and our new website better reflects the award winning innovative creative solutions we offer our clients
1450950 moving up a series hosted by noted and charismatic tlc personality doug wilson returns for a second season we follow a chain of new homeowners who move into one anothers homes and begin the design and renovation process they all have plenty to say about their new digs and the unappealing design demons the past owners left behind theyll work tirelessly to make their new house their home with numerous design choices and big renovations to implement after the renovations are complete the old homeowners will get the rare chance to visit their once beloved homes and see all of the new changes will they happily approve of what they see or will they wish that they had never come back
1450951 old garden roses are kind of like a well kept secret among gardeners
1450952 they have the scent the beauty the hardiness its a win win situation
1450953 ive been growing roses for 20 years and collecting old garden roses for the past 10 years
1450954 the scent they all smell so nostalgic and theyre historic
1450955 empress josephine was a rose collector and i can understand why
1450956 there were a lot of trees and it was really dank and dark
1450957 my husband is from australia and he loves the greenery here
1450958 so when we renovate he wants evergreens and i want roses sometimes he wins and sometimes i win
1450959 the garden is a positive thing in a dark place
1450960 but now its not it seems like crime has gone down since we moved here its probably not all the garden but i think it has helped
1450961 people come in and they only take what they need
1450962 people love it when we have the vegetables and are giving them away
1450963 it really makes a difference for some of the single parents especially now that food is more expensive
1450964 over time you just kind of talk to people because you see them walking by
1450965 theres nothing quite like handing some big tough guy a pretty flower
1450966 a community garden is a good way to do it
1450967 openoffice can successfully substitute proprietary applications and will result in significant savings on licenses
1450968 its always nice to have people strolling in the garden
1450969 she says her garden includes fences made with wood wrought iron and stained glass for extra texture
1450970 since so many gardens are small you need that space we have so many things that go up
1450971 if you keep coming back to certain colors or flowers find those preferences mine is orange
1450972 people come into the garden and they say its like a secret garden
1450973 it was just grass i had maybe 10 plants the first year that someone gave me its been a nibbling process over the years
1450974 really cold really up and down really full of early frosts
1450975 coming from the midwest where so much of the year you cant garden i found i wanted to do a four season garden
1450976 i have a husband and a son i live in a house of men the garden feels feminine and nurturing
1450977 the first garden i did i gardened for the flowers
1450978 i didnt pay enough attention to form and texture and shape of plants it was lots of flowers and lots of teeny leaves but nothing stood out
1450979 i spend a lot of time sitting and listening to the sound of birds or the frogs in the pond its a perfect contrast to my work
1450980 when we moved in it was all grass back here and all bark out front
1450981 there may have been five plants it was really really blank
1450982 we ended up with about 5 000 worth of native granite
1450983 i dont know if we wouldve found anything better suited for this place because it came from this place
1450984 i pretty much spend all my free time in the garden
1450985 theres something really satisfying about getting your hands dirty its almost like a conductor for the orchestra in the spring
1450986 one of the things i like about gardening is that youre never going to get to the end of it
1450987 youre just going to get deeper and deeper into what there is to know
1450988 if i go out there at recess theyre just flocking in there to help
1450989 they were like this tastes better than the carrots i get at the store
1450990 they were amazed at how fresh and flavorful it was
1450991 she really feels that kids having that knowledge first hand of where food comes from will encourage them to eat vegetables and if they grow their vegetables theyll eat them
1450992 i think digging around in the dirt any kind of hands on activity they just love
1450993 if you handle the plant roughly or let the roots dry out the plants are going to die so theyre learning how to take care of a garden
1450994 they have to really learn to focus and do the job theyre supposed to do and not goof off
1450995 the students all seem to take so much pride in watching the process
1450996 last year we put in the herbs in history garden
1450997 it features 25 plants that have been important in the kitchen and or medicinally in the past ive been able to work with many herbs with which i wasnt familiar
1450998 it is so satisfying to be able to dash outside while cooking dinner and take a few snips or to let whatever is ripe dictate what you are going to prepare
1450999 turns out it grows like crazy both out and up so i am constantly cutting it back otherwise it grows taller than the hydrangeas
1451000 i rarely use chemicals so i think the good bugs are taking care of the bad ones
1451001 sends up spikes of striking purple flowers that you can cut and use as an interesting stir stick in drinks
1451002 oregano is sometimes referred to as wild marjoram but the true marjoram that we can grow as a tender perennial has a much more pleasant flavor when used fresh
1451003 our cool wet springs help us grow nice lettuce and arugula both of them do well in pots that you can start when the ground is still too wet to work
1451004 chervil is a frilly pretty little plant that most people dont give a thought to its an easy to grow annual with a slight licorice flavor its great in eggs and is a component of fines herbes a classic herb blend
1451005 think about what you like to cook and eat start with the herbs that you regularly buy at the market consider the space you have and what is readily available locally for example tomatoes take up quite a bit of space and we can buy a tremendous variety in season at the farmers markets you might do well to grow something that you like but isnt around much like okra or fava beans which also have gorgeous flowers
1451006 one thing some people dont realize is the flowers of all culinary herbs are edible the leaves and flowers of nasturtiums have a wonderful peppery taste
1451007 calendula petals can be tossed into salads or baked goods for color borage flowers have a radish taste and dianthus is delectable dusted with sugar
1451008 those interested in eating flowers should do some research first you should always know how they were grown and make sure no sprays have been involved
1451009 im a pretty low tech gardener i like to pull weeds by hand because it is interesting to get down near the ground and see how the plants grow and who is living under there
1451010 skip the recycling bin pile filled with daily food scraps and compile lots of materials into a large pile at one time mix in old half finished compost if desired let it sit one month turn it and then let it sit one more month to produce excellent compost for your flowers and plants
1451011 but when youre looking to generate next springs batch of compost for the garden mix it into a well thought out layered compost heap
1451012 just make sure to remember to start turning it back under a few weeks to a month before you want to plant an area the next spring to give it time to decompose
1451013 all of these crops show such an undeniable quality difference over what can be found shipped into the grocery stores that its really heartening to see peoples response
1451014 get a high quality stirrup hoe and use it on nice sunny days before the weeds get more than a couple inches tall
1451015 i started gardening organically from day one primarily out of a sense of ecological responsibility
1451016 i couldnt face gassing a field full of honeybees in the process of spraying for something else
1451017 the specifics of the usda regulations take up a small book but it all comes down to the fact that no synthetic substances are allowed
1451018 its a mix of old time garden knowledge combined with modern advantages like mail order insects floating row cover a light weight fabric that keeps out pests and bagged organic fertilizer
1451019 think ahead and plan more there are just fewer quick fixes at hand to work with pest problems or deal with nutrient issues
1451020 a diverse system where nothing gets too out of balance
1451021 worth it to never have to worry about accidentally feeding a little kid residual fungicide with the strawberries his mom just bought worst case scenario someone might get a baby slug in their head of lettuce i dont like that idea but i can live with it
1451022 to provide whatcom and skagit counties with produce that blows their minds until we put ourselves out of the produce business by getting the entire region growing their own gardens
1451023 after messing around with various incarnations of inadequate fencing for the past decade we are fi nally finishing a proper 8 foot tall very stout field fence around the gardens and greenhouses as far as im concerned there really are few options for heavy deer pressure other than to live with it move or put up a fence
1451024 mostly our home garden is winter veggies which i sell starts for but dont grow out for produce sales kales collards brussels sprouts parsnips are all well loved around our house late fall through early spring
1451025 its definitely good for me to reconnect with the idea of just growing something purely for my own enjoyment of growing it
1451026 though i havent been able to make the time for a few years i also love to river kayak
1451027 one of my biggest earliest lessons in gardening was not using chemicals but failing to use anything in their place this does not work you have to give back to the soil to achieve healthy yields
1451028 because plants cant take up organic nutrients directly they need beneficial microbes to break them down first worms are a simple but pretty good indicator of the health of the soil they know where the action is
1451029 teaming with microbes a gardeners guide to the soil food web
1451030 i imagine the first steps would be to take the miracle grow and weed n feed to the toxic waste recycling center and stop by the country store on meridian or hohl feed and seed and peruse their organic soil amendments like alfalfa meal rock phos phate fish emulsion kelp meal etc
1451031 id estimate that 90 percent of the vegetable starts sold in whatcom county are chemically fed this makes for a hard transition when they get transplanted into a garden where they arent being spoon fed a nutrient solution every day
1451032 organic starts not only come with a longer lasting nutrient base in the pot but the plants are also already in a more natural nutrient foraging relationship with the soil this makes for less transplant shock
1451033 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1451034 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1451035 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1451036 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year
1451037 its essentially a race between the attackers and the protectors
1451038 give a head start to software providers delivering security features to our mutual customers
1451039 it will save vendors the work of reverse engineering the patch and identifying where the vulnerability is and what triggers the exploitability
1451040 the goal is to give it to them so they can have updates available as close to 10 a m as possible

1451134 i just like the serenity that water seems to bring
1451135 ive always had water features in my yard just to see the water moving is pleasing to the eye
1451136 if you have just a trickle it just seems like youve wasted a lot of time
1451137 we all take our drives up to mount baker and we all go ooh when we see water tumbling over a rock
1451138 i think thats one of the beauties of the northwest and you can try and bring that into your yard
1451139 i just like the serenity that water seems to bring
1451140 ive always had water features in my yard just to see the water moving is pleasing to the eye
1451141 with the church people come and have their lunch out here
1451142 i didnt have a lot of money when i first started out in this yard so i had to divide and propagate so i could fill my yard affordably
1451143 but every plant is different so you have to know where and when to take the cutting
1451144 my advice is to read about propagating to find out when the best time for your cutting is
1451145 she asked if i could take some cuttings and start them for her and i did
1451146 thats whats special about taking a cutting it brings back memories of where you got it from
1451147 the first thing i made was a bird made out of a shovel
1451148 ive made hundreds of different items just looking at different things picking up a piece of metal and seeing what i could do with it
1451149 i lie in bed at night dreaming of different things
1451150 i forget there are so many of them around here
1451151 i got a truck when i was 2 or 3 years old it was actually better than toys from the store i never got bored
1451152 i buy 500 seedlings per tray from van wingerden greenhouses in custer
1451153 theyre an inch high when you buy them and i keep them in my greenhouse transferring them later into flats and then into the soil
1451154 this enables me to fill my backyard with some 3 000 impatiens and begonias but you do need a greenhouse or sufficient space to keep the seedlings indoors until the weather improves
1451155 i get a lot of my stuff at the big box stores because many of the plant products are the same brands the bigger nurseries carry but available at a cheaper price
1451156 after a stressful day at work i could come home begin working in the garden and totally forget all the days problems
1451157 i love seeing the beauty a seed or plant can give you the colors and textures are never ending
1451158 once they get in the greenhouse theyre hard to get rid of

1451161 anyone who enjoys gardening and wants to enjoy the fruits of their labor indoors and outdoors people who just want a better appreciation of flowers rather than sticking flowers in a mason jar come to class and learn how to make something really stunning out of something that youve grown
1451162 one of the tricks of making flowers last longer in a vase is to make sure you can re cut a stem
1451163 the mistake that most people make is they just try to put their stems in perpendicular just straight up and down it makes it so that you dont have any control where the stems and flowers end up so you get that columnar look
1451164 yellow thats placed incorrectly will totally throw your design off if youre not sure about yellow use it with gusto put it in there and make it stand out for you other colors you can kind of fudge with
1451165 im the one who goes into restaurants and rearranges their vases
1451166 i get a lot of pleasure out of it i like instructing and trying to impart knowledge to other people just so they can appreciate flowers more flowers by themselves are beautiful i think everybody gets pleasure from it
1451167 i want to turn people into flower lovers i think its good for the whole industry if people have success with what theyve grown or what theyve bought theyre apt to repeat the process
1451168 and i found out the food bank takes fresh produce
1451169 i hope people can plant stuff they really like but then take as well
1451170 theyve got 6 and 4 year old attention spans but they love it
1451171 they love to plant and play out there in the dirt and dig holes my next goal is to get them into weeding
1451172 so hopefully they can come back in the fall with their parents
1451173 i dont know what it is but i just think its good for kids to plant and see things grow and just be in touch with where their food comes from
1451174 if i presented my kids with a plate of chard theyd say no but if they pull out of the ground themselves theyll eat it
1451175 it seems like in neighborhoods where people know each other theres less vandalism and stuff like that
1451176 my hope is people will get to know each other and watch out for each other
1451177 if you fall on the plants were not going to be mad its more about the experience than the product

1451278 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1451279 we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1451280 the scientific research on the effect of grooves on spin and the ability of highly skilled professional golfers to control shots from the rough was very compelling
1451281 the usga and the r amp a took additional time to consider fully the potential ramifications for all levels of golfers in particular we took care to minimize the impact on amateurs who actively compete in club and local competitions as well as other golfers who do not want to replace recently purchased clubs
1451282 ultimately we came to the conclusion that the path forward was to get the top level professional tours under the new groove regulations as soon as possible and to phase in the next level of amateur competition four years later in 2014
1451283 this means that clubs you own today will still be conforming for top level amateur competition for another 5 1 2 years and for other competitions conforming until at least 2024 if not indefinitely

1451348 yes in appalachia the need is extreme but this isnt just an isolated problem this is just where all our national health care problems converge high cost lack of access this is where the most number of people fall through the cracks
1451349 other nations have a lower gdp than we do and theyve made a political decision that their people are going to have health coverage but we keep deciding not to
1451350 we like to believe that everyone can get the care they need
1451351 but people who are low income work hard and dont have coverage through a job have to make harsh economic choices about their health care that might be to have a tooth pulled instead of getting a crown or to go without care at all
1451352 the diet here which is high in processed sugary foods because theyre cheaper promotes decay and when your teeth hurt you arent going to be eating salads

1451438 hey itd be very easy to find a computer programmer who could write some software that would already determine the winner regardless of the vote totals
1451439 realistically could the fix be put on in a national election
1451440 get me a job with a company that writes the software for this program then id have access to one third of the votes is that enough to fix a general election
1451441 when it comes to computerized elections there are no safeguards its not a door without locks its a house without doors
1451442 there is no adequate and proper safeguard against the computers being programmed to distort the election results
1451443 one major problem is that computer codes that run the machines are protected as trade secrets which makes it very hard to have an election independently audited
1451444 the election industry is virtually unregulated there are no mandatory regulations or standards for accurately recording and counting votes
1451445 you have to have access to some degree of technical knowledge to penetrate an electronic tabulating system most of them have been or will be simply because voting is the way we determine who gets power in this country
1451446 some critics of computerized vote counting worry about the potential for
1451447 anyone with access codes could punch into elections and change the results and nobody would be the wiser that also goes for the software involved

1451489 mr mcallister was appointed through fair and open competition by an independent panel we are not aware of any formal complaint about mr mcallisters role in relation to claims and complaints during his time as president of the law society of scotland and no evidence has been presented to us which would raise any questions over the decision of the selection panel
1451490 i am interested in what the witnesses have just said about the law society having nothing to do with the arrangements for handling negligence claims i have in front of me a memorandum in connection with the case of one of my constituents it was issued by mr mill on 5 july 2001
1451491 mr mills memo was written to the then president of the law society mr mcallister
1451492 regulation of the legal profession inquiry which was heavily restricted in content amp remit by the then convener christine grahame msp snp martin mcallister the then president of the law society of scotland made the following comments
1451493 we are open to change and want to make improvements it is proper that parliament is reviewing the checks and balances that operate but it is a fundamental right of citizens in a democracy that the legal profession is independent such a profession is a guarantor of the rights of citizens and in scotland we deserve no less
1451494 the point is that the organisation is changing we have made a number of changes in how we deal with complaints over the past 10 years i do not think that the committee would find it useful to go through a list of those but some key things are important in improving public perception one of which is greater lay involvement a second is the improvement in literature so that the public have a much better idea of how we deal with complaints we have brought with us our current revised leaflets

1451496 the current rush to invest in unconventional fossil fuels is wholly inappropriate and due to their carbon intensity these projects risk dangerous levels of climate change
1451497 unconventional fuel sources may seem attractive in the short term but ultimately the environmental and economic costs are unthinkable
1451498 companies and investors claim to recognise the need to tackle climate change and support international efforts such as kyoto climate change protocol in oil sands we have an activity that is going against this imperative and undermining canadas kyoto commitments so it is time for investors to challenge this strategy
1451499 the global demand for energy is growing this will mean greater demand for oil and gas too supplies of accessible conventional oil and gas cannot keep up with the demand growth as a result society has little choice but to add other sources of energy including unconventional fuels like oil sands
1451500 reserves of oil sands represent a significant untapped resource from a politically stable country the husky joint venture bp is planning will use a process known as steam assisted gravity drainage not mining which produces oil in situ with a significant reduction of both water use and overall environmental footprint

1451503 a major step toward opening this important energy resource for domestic use
1451504 epa believes that the oil shale and tar sands development process may have significant adverse impacts to air quality in particular by increasing levels of ozone and nitrogen deposition and impairing visibility on a regional level
1451505 given the sensitive resources and the potential for impacts to air quality and water quality epa believes that it may be difficult to support a finding of no significant impact in the subsequent nepa analysis
1451506 a major step toward opening this important energy resource for domestic use
1451507 if it is going to be done it will meet the environmental regulations
1451508 blm has an obligation under nepa to take a close hard look at the reasonably foreseeable developments including proposed tar sands and oil shale activities that are likely in the next several decades as well as the expansion of existing oil and gas operations regardless of whether or not an application for drilling has been submitted to your office
1451509 oil shale certainly would be a very large contributer to whatever air quality concerns epa is asking blm to consider

1451552 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1451553 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1451554 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1451555 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1451556 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves

1451577 we cannot even verify that he is a united states citizen we cannot find even basic documentation of that fact he has simply no ties to anywhere the only ties that he has are to sandra boss and reigh there is no record of any clark rockefeller before 1993 and he has not provided any information for us to document who he is
1451578 as she was walking through the office she could hear reighs voice in another room and as soon as she heard her voice she ran down the hallway to be reunited with her daughter and just hugs and kisses

1451668 resulta costoso que el montubio salga de su comunidad para hacerse atender adem s por eso no se pueden prevenir las enfermedades porque la persona sale a hacerse atender cuando ya est grave y muchas veces no hay medicinas

1451676 el dilema no es saber si se est a favor o en contra sino que se resuelva la proyecci n del nuevo seguro para que no haya los problemas que ahora tiene el seguro campesino

1451680 but would it be fair to put the economy into a deep recession or depression i dont think so
1451681 t he experience was a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces
1451682 the drastic decline in the quantity of money during those years and the occurrence of a banking panic of unprecedented severity were not the inevitable consequences of other economic changes
1451683 throughout the contraction the system had ample powers to cut short the tragic process of monetary deflation and banking collapse had it used those powers effectively in late 1930 or even in early to mid 1931 such action would have eased the severity of the contraction and very likely would have brought it to an end at a much earlier date

1451816 every time a living person tells a lie it speeds up his clock
1451817 thats bill clintons clock we decided to use it as a fan
1451818 maybe ill just go out and catch my own alligator so i can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price
1451819 by all means be my guest maybe youll luck out and catch yourself a big one

1451825 karl rove was there to recognize that there were substantial powers to be obtained by catering to stupid stubborn people and george w bush would be the man to harvest such resources
1451826 george w understood stupid people well they were not dumb their minds were not physically crippled in any way they had chosen to be stupid because that offered its own kind of power to win a great many small contests of will they needed only to ignore all evidence bright people would break down trying to argue with them
1451827 youve got an economic slowdown and markets are slowly coming to terms with it
1451828 some of the speculation that was looking for safe harbour in commodities is starting to unwind
1451829 we always tell our families that we would like more in case there is a problem
1451830 if you think about it susan in the old star trek episodes there was always a problem so you go and fix the problem and the next time youre successful
1451831 unfortunately styluses will be chosen at random we cannot guarantee design nor can we take special orders for specific characters
1451832 t o mira lo que me he encontrado en el supermercado
1451833 he le do me han dicho que es bueno para la salud
1451834 he le do me han dicho que es malo para la piel
1451835 so once more what is wrong with the words that i have written that you have to make a personal attack on me in an attempt to discredit what ive written
1451836 what some of the safety gurus including the main idiot do is read a book or surf the web
1451837 you move with the control stick you use the l and r buttons to shield press the z button to grab the a button is a standard attack b button is special attack if you press over and b at the same time or up and b or down and b it does a different special attack its different for each character x and y are jump and if you go up and a or over and a or down and a you smash attack which you can charge up if you want then the c stick is like doing the smash attack except whichever way you push it its not as powerful but its easier then the last thing is the d pad depending on which way you push it is a different taunt oh and you also use a to pick up items
1451838 wouldnt it be nicer if the metaphor was cookie and this tasted like actual food
1451839 you know i got to this point in that venture where i just didnt think it was going to work
1451840 well i also need to please these people and i also shouldnt be too controversial about this
1451841 the ongoing process by which the worlds multiple idiocies are becoming one giant useless force
1451842 yes i know sascha shocking but i am making dinner
1451843 in nature the bee and the flower desire one another and indulge one another with a true act of love
1451844 looks nice but how are you going to make sure that top doesnt come untied
1451845 this six foot story funnel drops riders from 75 feet in the air
1451846 if the bald headed gentlemen want out of your top they want out
1451847 i dont know if its going to be the youthful happening woodstock they want it to be but it certainly has the potential
1451848 it will be a failure if it is only well dressed people over 35 from the bay area treating it as if its another ferry plaza farmers market
1451849 doesnt know norm is a genius and makes sure to tivo every show
1451850 thank god and mary that finally the politicians are responding to our plight
1451851 perhaps once the great chicken problem has been dealt with we will be able to get back to less important issues in the senate like faltering education and inadequate civil services
1451852 were going to get that son of a bitch highway
1451853 we are deeply honored to have served our lord helms faithfully
1451854 however now that his staunch army of katana wielding conservatives has joined him in the blessed realm of tengoku he can continue legislating from beyond the confines of the celestial heavens
1451855 were going to get that son of a bitch highway
1451856 with the exception of preventing war this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetime
1451857 senator obamas solution to high gas prices is telling americans to make sure their tires are inflated

1451859 what was most strikingly unique about assistant attorney general deval patricks leadership was the degree to which he used the power of his office to intimidate american citizens into conforming with his vision of civil rights
1451860 tot el que cal saber per a saber ho tot
1451861 hundreds of billions of dollars is stolen from the american tax payer by congress each year we can pay for this from the tax money they have been stealing from us each year

1451864 oh ho ho ho i so have a sense of humour abuot what a prick i am a ho ho ho
1451865 everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face
1451866 my job as an aquatic educator is a very rewarding experience because i am able to share information that will impact a childs life and how they view and interact with our states natural resources
1451867 i used to say that barack obama raises taxes and john mccain cuts them and i was convinced
1451868 obama thinks we can cure our energy problem and dependance on foreign oil merely by keeping our tires inflated
1451869 i suppose ive always grown up around the idea of starting a shop in order to start a scene

1451876 my biggest problem with this whole thing no one likes to lose i did lose my opponent got more votes but i dont want my constituents theyre still my constituents until the end of the year to ever have to go through this kind of election
1451877 robinsons fundamental inaccuracies claiming i managed races i know nothing about or claiming i served in a official capacity with groups i dont belong to speak to the baseless merit of the entire case he cant get the facts straight
1451878 the real facts are evident robinson was resoundingly defeated as was james taylor in the primary election the voters spoke clearly these candidates need to accept the will of the voters and move on
1451879 i look forward to representing district 14 in santa fe as state senator

1451950 i personally like christian artists because i really think they believe in something
1451951 a lot of times what youre trying to do is find something that the artists believe in and with a christian artist you know what that thing is that takes that part of it away and i dont have to worry about that i know what i have to do and i need to make sure the songs all respect that part of their world we discuss a lot of religious things in a creative way and a lot of that comes out in the record because of the way i challenge them and they challenge me

1451955 ive come to realize when you get older in your faith you dont necessarily have fewer questions
1451956 i used to get mad at myself when id have questions about my faith but ive learned through the years that god has answered so many of those and sometimes its not right away sometimes its years before you get the answer but hes proven himself now when i have questions i get excited about it not angry at myself but excited because i know that gods going to show me something new the older you get and you have more questions you feel actually pretty good about that because you know the answer is going to be there one day

1451964 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1451965 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s

1452000 you have to be a great player for the guys to respect you and vote for you as captain ryan is a determined player he is a really tough kid and will do what ever that is asked of him marty is also a tough player while he also keeps things light in the locker room so it is a good combination of captains

1452007 we welcome the strong leadership showed by the congressional co sponsors of this important new legislation vulture funds are grabbing the proceeds from debt relief of some of the poorest countries in the world this bill should make vulture funds think twice before suing the poor for profit
1452008 the stop vulture funds act would protect the worlds poorest countries from the predatory practices of vulture funds and allow these countries to use their limited resources to meet the needs of their people
1452009 the profiteering tactics used by these vulture funds are undercutting progress made towards relieving the debt burdens of the worlds poorest countries
1452010 hr 6796 is a key step in closing the legal loopholes which have allowed these vultures to operate in such a devious way
1452011 weve seen how these greedy lawsuits can hinder health and education programs in countries such as zambia

1452014 we just got off a conference call with camp mccain defending their new ad comparing barack obama to paris hilton and britney spears

1452016 the problem anyone with even a vague sense of pop culture knows that britney and paris are yesterdays news heres a link to forbes celebrity 100 paris and britney dont even make the list any more
1452017 instead the top 10 in order oprah winfrey tiger woods angelina jolie beyonce knowles david beckham johnny depp jay z the police jk rowling brad pitt
1452018 so they didnt pick other big celebrities who were either men or black or married
1452019 but it must have been a coincidence because we know john mccain wants to run an elevated campaign focusing on the serious issues that america faces

1452197 the matter is closed now he ronaldo is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1452198 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the northern summer for real madrid
1452199 we believe that this squad is full of quality of plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1452200 we said that the new arrivals would be few but of great quality that seemed logical after two successful seasons in which weve brought in 19 young promising players
1452201 this the low number of signings was a request of the board of directors

1452243 our research shows that the rough has become less of a challenge for the highly skilled professional and that driving accuracy is now less of a key factor for success
1452244 we believe that these changes will increase the challenge of the game at the tour level while having a very small effect on the play of most golfers
1452245 the scientific research on the effect of grooves on spin and the ability of highly skilled professional golfers to control shots from the rough was very compelling
1452246 the usga and the r amp a took additional time to consider fully the potential ramifications for all levels of golfers in particular we took care to minimize the impact on amateurs who actively compete in club and local competitions as well as other golfers who do not want to replace recently purchased clubs
1452247 ultimately we came to the conclusion that the path forward was to get the top level professional tours under the new groove regulations as soon as possible and to phase in the next level of amateur competition four years later in 2014
1452248 this means that clubs you own today will still be conforming for top level amateur competition for another 5 1 2 years and for other competitions conforming until at least 2024 if not indefinitely

1452293 having studied in detail the programmes of real madrid and the dutch eleven i realised that given the physical effort required to perform at my maximum i was going to have to make a choice
1452294 the combination of the competition cup and champions league games of real madrid and the programme of the dutch team is too heavy a burden
1452295 obviously such a decision is not something one takes in a night i have experienced a great euro 2008 with the orange team and i look back on it with fondness
1452296 of course i find it a pity that i wont be able to call on his quality and international experience in putting teams together in the future

1452322 i f speaker pelosi wants to stop sen mccain from speaking on the floor she could come back and call us in
1452323 but if she doesnt come back and call us in then i can certainly invite sen mccain out on the floor and let him join us in discussing uh the fact that we need to change energy policy in this country
1452324 theyll have to use their imagination as to how they can get a vote and then they may get a vote
1452325 what i am trying to we have serious policy issues in our country
1452326 i think its ironic that barack obamas theme is change and yet on the single most important change uh facing this country is to change our energy policy hes saying well i dont want any change there
1452327 when i got elected in 1994 and came out here and began to serve
1452328 i discovered something about news and that is i used to say news travels to by covered wagon and what that meant was it really didnt matter what i was doing back here almost none of it made it all the way back to he compared the coverage in his district to that of rep pete hoekstra r mich where local media have covered the protest pete hoekstra saturday morning hed gotten stuck here overnight because they cancelled his flight he said that this story was on every radio station in his district every tv station in his district and every newspaper in his district
1452329 i opened my newspaper not a word i ran through the tv stations not a word so im completely oppressed im saying here i am fighting on the floor for the cause of freedom and for the cause of american energy production and nobody knows about it
1452330 the record ended up being about holding on to youthful ideals in the face of aging
1452331 i was thinking a lot about depression and the relationship between depression and creativity certainly theres been any number of artists that have done both
1452332 there was this transition period where i wondered wait a minute this is going to be awful if i get in shape and lose my creativity
1452333 at 36 i have to admit theres a lot of time and energy spent on just staying healthy
1452334 if youre not working at it its kinda working against you
1452335 doesnt it hurt just a little to know that google is the leader in the silverlight advertising space before your company has even scratched the surface
1452336 surely it would make some sense to take control of the silverlight advertising space in a big way wouldnt it once again google has pulled the wool over microsofts eyes and the company is in the dark circling around wondering how in the world itll be able to beat google on something anything
1452337 if this isnt the catalyst microsoft needs i dont know what is
1452338 not only being boxed out of the advertising space all over the web but now its being boxed out of advertising on its own platform without even harnessing its power to fight back
1452339 microsofts very own platform is already being hijacked by its biggest competitor and it better move fast if it doesnt want to be pushed out of that advertising space too
1452340 why microsoft is not utilizing silverlight 2 to serve video ads coming from its advertising inventory
1452341 when the brand name is entered as a keyword in a search the scam ad appears hijacking the consumer to the competitors site
1452342 there are deceptive ads that promise free credit reports that are not free and others that promise free ringtones that cost 10 a month
1452343 my sense is that there are an awful lot of scams out there online and more and more of them are reaching users through search engines it seems like a better design for the future of the internet to have search engines step up and take greater responsibility rather than for users to have to take such great precautions with real costs like the costs of getting victimized and losing money

1452348 people that are investigating ria in the enterprise will find us

1452358 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1452359 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1452360 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1452361 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1452362 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1452363 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1452364 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1452365 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1452366 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations

1452392 only a small percentage of consumer marijuana sales in california occur within the medical marijuana market even so the dispensaries by serving as a gold standard for producers and consumers have fuelled the popularity of high end strains in much the same way that the popularity of the whole foods grocery chain has brought heirloom lettuce to ordinary supermarkets
1452393 he should make an immediate impact in both singles and doubles competition
1452394 im glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
1452395 he never makes a golf course easier so hes perfect for major championships
1452396 at the end of the day our mission has been accomplished
1452397 i played augusta this year for the first time and torrey pines and the u s open but those dont even come close to how hard oakland hills will play
1452398 a major championship is really the players against the golf course
1452399 it has to be a total examination of a players game changes in technology force you to change the course so the test will remain difficult
1452400 the 51 open was the first site for a major championship that was drastically different
1452401 technology had changed the game the players were better too so dad added distance
1452402 but he scattered them around dad put them 180 yards off the tee in areas where they actually hit the ball he wanted the first one to catch a shot from jerry barber the second to catch one from ben hogan and the third to catch one from sam snead they all hit the ball different distances but they would have the same difficulty on the next shot
1452403 they look at where a guy hits shots and they put a bunker there
1452404 i dont get the idea of putting bunkers on both sides of a fairway thats just protecting the golf course
1452405 you have to let the ball bounce in the fairway and run with the flow of the land without fear of it running into a bunker
1452406 redesigning classic courses is delicate business you want to enhance the original design without altering the intent of the designer
1452407 our aim is for the golf course to be the test
1452408 we dont want to get in the way of the player and how the architect intended for the golf course to be played what the score is the score is
1452409 youll have to be focused and concentrate if you want to score well
1452410 when you mix things up like they did at torrey pines
1452411 you can actually make about four golf courses in one that gives the players a lot more options
1452412 all i learned about designing courses was taught to me by dad
1452413 we never took summer vacations we always spent the summer working on a golf course the workers on the construction teams were my babysitters
1452414 i told them how important that club is to my family and to me
1452415 i had been waiting my entire career for the chance to rebuild its golf course
1452416 hahaha im going to fucking rip your head off and feed it to cody and cassidy
1452417 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
1452418 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
1452419 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
1452420 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
1452421 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
1452422 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together

1452424 i wont do stolen documents i wont do medical records if someone hands it
1452425 when britney spears was in the hospital it was shocking to me but we were contacted by medical personnel you really have to draw the line
1452426 were the same three jerks we always were im actually quite proud of the fact that its gone on as long as it has
1452427 im in front of the stage and you literally see people break out into sobs or kiss each other and jump around expressing joy
1452428 when he exercises his right to have it the way he imagined it its a problem for both him and me
1452429 i just cant do it i cant remember it i have my own ideas im incorrigible
1452430 but not really to the extent where we were able to clear up all of our misconceptions about each other
1452431 it was really good for us to figure out what made the band work and what didnt work so we could appreciate each other unconfused by these other issues
1452432 we are the mighty police and we are totally at sea
1452433 as were getting more into it and less uptight about living the legend it is actually becoming the stuff that got us here
1452434 it was the commitment in the beginning that made it possible that it was a finite commitment that has actually made it a lot of fun
1452435 im fully prepared to say that was it were fine and were done
1452436 on the other hand im fully prepared if someone comes back in a couple of years and says we ought to give it a go you have to consider it
1452437 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that
1452438 lasted approximately 4 1 2 hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting with family members this morning
1452439 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1452440 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1452441 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1452442 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1452443 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1452444 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1452445 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbours drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1452446 if your opponent is quick to anger seek to irritate him
1452447 my dogs prescription cost 25 dollars and my mom pays 300 dollars for the same thing
1452448 i drank a lot of tea and was out of the room
1452449 at this moment we must come together and act to address the housing crisis that set this downturn in motion and continues to eat away at the publics confidence in the market we should pass the legislation
1452450 now in terms of knowing my commitments you dont have to just look at my words you can look at my deeds just this past week we passed out of the u s senate banking committee which is my committee a bill to call for divestment from iran as a way of ratcheting up the pressure to ensure that they dont obtain a nuclear weapon
1452451 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well

1452561 theres potential promise that vitamin c is part of the armamentarium for treating some cancers

1452565 should patients with any kind of tumor go out and get iv ascorbate vitamin c thats not the message here
1452566 like so many things that are intriguing or appear to be promising there appears to be a long way to go from the theory in the lab to the practical application in the clinic
1452567 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
1452568 twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
1452569 women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
1452570 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
1452571 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
1452572 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
1452573 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
1452574 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
1452575 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve
1452576 occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
1452577 at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
1452578 left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed
1452579 whats at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself
1452580 when our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own
1452581 today is the worst day of my life i cant imagine that the person who destroyed a whole family got only two months
1452582 im completely shattered by the news she has destroyed my family life my social life and she has destroyed me economically she destroyed my credibility there is also the effect on my children i believe they didnt consider these things completely
1452583 i was upset i was drunk and experienced a pain with my vagina i was extremely disorientated in the taxi i arrived home at that stage i seriously believed i had experienced a genuine sexual assault i returned to normality and realised it had not taken place by that time the police were on their way the incident had spiraled out of control and i was concerned about what would happen if i said it had not happened at all
1452584 when did scanner become a sounding board for misogynist cavemen this girls crime was being drunk and confused it is an unfortunate situation no doubt if your daughter came home and told you she had been raped it is a parents responsibility not only to believe her but to become an advocate on her behalf whether she is a drunken teenager or not shame on all of you
1452585 a word ive always associated with male anatomy but alas it was also pink after a quick glance to see if anyone was watching i grabbed one of the pink boxes hid it under the power drill i was buying to reassure myself of my masculinity and brought it home
1452586 ok first let me say that i have never been able to register a domain that was already taken
1452587 so a few days ago i register a domain and receive my emailed receipt so i assumed everything went smoothly but a couple of days later i receive an email stating my funds have been refunded because the domain was already registered thru another registrar
1452588 ahah they wont let me register the domain name that i just registered at another company
1452589 ok first let me say that i have never been able to register a domain that was already taken
1452590 so a few days ago i register a domain and receive my emailed receipt so i assumed everything went smoothly but a couple of days later i receive an email stating my funds have been refunded because the domain was already registered thru another registrar

1452605 about three quarters of the streams tested in the rivanna river watershed failed to meet department of environmental quality standards according to a new report
1452606 ive always thought streamwatch is a great service to the community because it reminds us that our streams really arent as healthy as we probably think that they are and there are things that we can do about it
1452607 i think it probably did affect our decision to increase the requirements for subdivisions to have buffers along the streams
1452608 it definitely gives us a reality check and shows us what were doing to the water quality around us

1452617 can you imagine being without a home out in the cold
1452618 many of the women come to us just with the clothes that theyre wearing
1452619 i just think that life is basic it all boils down to having something to do someone to do it with and something to look forward to
1452620 i sewed when i was in high school that was the last time
1452621 i could just have a green room with a quilt
1452622 when we get to the fabric store we just love it love it love it

1452624 concerns that the pending executions of two men could cause violent protests prompted maryland state police surveillance of death penalty opponents and peace activists police superintendent terrence b sheridan said yesterday after a review of the controversial monitoring program
1452625 law enforcement has no right or authority to infringe on citizens rights to free speech or public assembly
1452626 the question that comes up is judgment they shouldnt have gone on that long
1452627 so we make sure our policies reflect the standards of this administration
1452628 were troubled that colonel sheridan did not give a scintilla of evidence to show any basis to be worried about disturbances
1452629 and his explanation does not even begin to explain the surveillance or how local peace groups or local pacifists came to be listed in criminal databases
1452630 to provide a disciplined well trained and well equipped law enforcement and support response designed to ensure maximum effectiveness to preserve and restore order in response to the execution of vernon lee evans jr

1452666 but nobody seems to be talking about power laws nobodys saying that one day a single company may possibly emerge to dominate the cloud the way google came to dominate search the way microsoft came to dominate software monopoly issues aside could you imagine such a company we wouldnt be talking about a multi billion dollar business like todays microsoft or google were talking about something that could feasibly dwarf them were potentially talking about a multi trillion dollar company possibly the largest company to have ever existed i imagine my friends who work for the aforementioned companies know all this and know how vast the stakes are windows vs apple who cares kids stuff theres a much bigger game going on and for some reason its utter enormity seems to be a very well kept secret
1452667 one of the elements that make zooms social network uniquely valuable to marketers is the dwell time
1452668 patrons are generally at these establishments for up to 2 hours which allows for longer form communications multiple messages and more creative forms of ads than can be accommodated in an environment with lower dwell times

1452673 the bubble has burst i think my generation will be the last to see a great america
1452674 weve all been so greedy for so long and it has caught up with us
1452675 we have become a nation of whiners you just hear this constant whining complaining about a loss of competitiveness america in decline thank god the economy is not as bad as you read in the newspaper every day
1452676 people lost their homes even though they had borrowed only 10 of the purchase price
1452677 people dont want to buy round here because they see all these empty houses and wonder whats wrong with the area
1452678 if you do some research you can make a lot out of nothing
1452679 a year after prince william county launched a crackdown on illegal immigrants virginia has implemented a law that requires something similar for every jurisdiction in the state
1452680 with our new law these people who are here illegally should be afraid of living anywhere in virginia right now
1452681 if youre here illegally its not any scarier to live in prince william than in any other county
1452682 wed like to detain everyone but that is a fantasy world
1452683 we are not agents of the ice we are a local branch of government
1452684 i mean in essence what is happening is these 287 g localities are taking on the responsibility of ice doing its job and these localities are paying for it
1452685 it may be that 287 g is moot for us
1452686 one of the reasons we applied was to expedite identifying and processing illegal immigrants but if were going to end up with the very same results just by reporting under the new law and having ice do the work obviously there would be no reason to participate
1452687 based on our interaction with ice i am pretty confident that our program is more intensive than what will evolve in those other jurisdictions
1452688 some of those people may not have been illegal aliens but this stat shows you they do not have the resources
1452689 whether ice comes and gets them and ultimately deports them is a matter that is beyond our control
1452690 were spending resources to provide this information to ice and we need to know what the results are
1452691 five years ago immigration enforcement for state and local law enforcement agencies wasnt even on the radar scope
1452692 stateless computing isnt about having no state its about where that state is stored
1452693 since the 1980s weve stored the state on the computer thats presented the myriad challenges that have sent costs through the roof the basic idea of stateless is that we want to move from a dedicated server network to a shared server network
1452694 the typical businessperson comes in and says i have an application i need to run and i need 20 machines what we want to get to is i need x amount of capacity and i need it for this amount of time i need 20 units of capacity and at the end of the month i need 100 units of capacity in some sense thats the bigger definition of a cloud amazon is offering cloud services where you need x amount of capacity

1452727 after careful consideration ive decided not to endorse your park
1452728 no but you should cuz one day you wont be able to you know just wake up
1452729 hey blonde you know what you are just a dirty son of a bitch
1452730 i am the wrath of god who else is with me
1452731 where were from the birds sing a pretty song and theres always music in the air
1452732 you met me at a strange time in my life
1452733 why would i pay money to see a movie where i dont actually see tits when i can go and look at them for free on the internet
1452734 i think the fed would rather wait until after the election before they consider raising rates
1452735 that will give them time to get a better view of the economy and see if financial markets have become less fragile
1452736 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1452737 i was in witness protection last year im out now
1452738 i can come out and do my thing a little bit and have fun with this team because this team is a lot of fun
1452739 hes a lot of fun to be around but he wants to do well on the football field and thats the most important thing
1452740 yeah i can play fast im not as hesitant when i get off the ball now
1452741 now i know where im going so im there full speed that makes more of a difference than thinking because when youre thinking you play a little slower
1452742 i like tank he is real quick off the ball he is strong he is doing things better than he was last year
1452743 he has learned to use his hands better he may be the strongest guy we have so we have gotten him to utilize that
1452744 i was sitting in a jail cell not understanding if id ever play again now that im here and i have this opportunity im really embracing it
1452745 i dont take a day for granted because ive been in a position this could not be here
1452746 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1452747 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1452748 it was summer and it was austin where keeping things weird is a popular civic pastime
1452749 dont want to disrespect but code pink is so 1960
1452750 this is an interesting discovery and shows that there is a resource potential in the hassi mouina licence
1452751 whether its called the power to remove these are impeachment hearings
1452752 what were here for is something called impeachment lite were sort of in that never neverland of accusing the president of impeachable offenses but not taking actions to impeach him which i guess impugns him but does not impeach him but maybe it has the same effect in the court of public opinion
1452753 if lying about consensual sexual activity fits the bill for impeachment then certainly lying to the american people about the reason for invading iraq qualifies as an official excuse me as an impeachable offense
1452754 nothing is going to come out of this hearing with regard to impeachment
1452755 the democratic leadership has said time and again they have no intention of bringing any impeachment resolution
1452756 i know that many here today on both sides of the rostrum and many looking in are anxious to debate whether the 43rd president of the united states should be impeached and id like to address myself to that issue in my opening remarks
1452757 i want to take the chairman at his word this morning that this hearing is not about impeachment
1452758 and therefore i hope we can expect that none of the witnesses will even mention the word impeachment
1452759 i accept the correctness of the reports and i am bound by the observations but im not bound by the deductions made by the state pathologist
1452760 we are in a position to give them another week to recover
1452761 this is jonghis reward for his good super 14 and currie cup performances he could take the next step up
1452762 if anything happens to bryan well know who the next best player in that position is
1452763 we laid down the principles for our game at the time
1452764 we do not view practice sessions in isolation i regard him as an international player and he just has to fit in
1452765 there are no excuses not from him and not from me
1452766 players sometimes improve so much that they deserve to be up there the same applies to adriaan strauss we feel they should be there
1452767 i only hope he mtawarira does not let himself and me down one never knows whether you have made the right selections until you have given them an opportunity to play
1452768 lets first see what happens on the field if you do things too quickly fate can grab you by the tail and then you dont know where youre sitting
1452769 in 1963 while fighting for freedom that we now enjoy i was wrongly charged convicted and imprisoned for 10 years by a judge
1452770 we might see a repeat of that situation as they can still wrongly convict me even though i know i am innocent
1452771 were convinced that this conspiracy is being led by the state president against our president
1452772 before you go to him you must kill the youth of this country
1452773 as a former prosecutor and a former attorney general gov gilmore is a forceful advocate for transparency by public officials
1452774 neither gov gilmore nor his staff noticed this clerical error as the senate form was signed and forwarded to the secretary of the senate but the governor today instructed his staff and his financial adviser to amend the senate disclosure form and provide the correct information as soon as possible
1452775 i dont recall ever hearing of jim gilmore he clearly made a mistake or someone publishing on his behalf made a mistake
1452776 we are not affiliated with the virginia company its just a coincidence we have the same name
1452777 a leading consultancy for financial and government services as well as project management in central and eastern europe
1452778 this was a clerical oversight that will be amended as soon as possible
1452779 this is one of the basic disclosure documents that tells you where that person is coming from as a candidate and they are swearing the form is accurate
1452780 they are saying these are the assets i have and these the connections i have
1452781 this is one of the only documents they have to sign
1452782 dont ask dont tell and whatever you do dont ask elaine donnelly to tell you what she thinks about gays in the military
1452783 a group of black lesbians who decided to gang assault
1452784 by this analysis we ought to recruit only lesbians for the military because they have the lowest incidence of hiv in the country
1452785 arent professional enough to serve openly with gay troops while successfully completing their military mission
1452786 what would you say to cynthia yost the woman on a training exercise assaulted by a group of lesbians
1452787 would you please tell me miss donnelly why i should give one twit about this womans sexual orientation when it didnt interfere one bit with her service
1452788 youre saying she has no right to serve her country because she happens to have a different sexual orientation than you
1452789 nearly died to secure rights for others that i myself was not free to enjoy
1452790 san francisco left who want to impose their agenda on the military
1452791 in the military environment team cohesion morale and esprit de corps is a matter of life and death
1452792 the only way to keep from freezing at night was to get as close as possible for body heat which means skin to skin
1452793 like a woman who is stared at her breasts are stared at
1452794 i think the dont ask dont tell policy is unpatriotic i think its counterproductive in fact i think it is absolutely cruel
1452795 the house yesterday easily approved legislation that seeks to slow the steepest slide in house prices in a generation rescue hundreds of thousands of homeowners at risk of foreclosure and reassure global markets that mortgage finance giants fannie mae and freddie mac will not be allowed to fail
1452796 this is not the time for a prolonged veto fight although were confident that the president would prevail in one
1452797 but with congress scheduled to leave soon for yet another recess the risk of not having a bill until the middle of september is not a risk worth taking in the current environment
1452798 i would be very disappointed if having helped us formulate this they dont take advantage of it
1452799 we said you have to protect the taxpayer but how you do it is up to you
1452800 going to the market is a tricky business and i think tying his hands is a mistake
1452801 give confidence to markets and will create a strong independent regulator better able to address the risks these enterprises pose
1452802 disappointed that the white house has indicated that theyll sign the bill
1452803 we should reform these institutions now either privatize them or publicize them
1452804 your watching the biggest party of the year with the hottest stars not to mention the host

1452807 even as a huge bipartisan majority in the senate voted yesterday to send a sprawling housing bill to the white house economists consumer advocates and other analysts said the package of programs for struggling homeowners and shaken mortgage lenders is unlikely to relieve the foreclosure crisis that is driving the nation toward recession
1452808 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
1452809 this legislation will not perform miracles i want the american people to have realistic expectations about what were about to do
1452810 but as others have said it is a step and an important step towards putting our nation on the road to economic recovery
1452811 this is not the bill he would have drafted on his own but its time for action
1452812 who have been caught between rising mortgage payments and falling home values and are in danger of losing their homes
1452813 everything is so unstable and people are so panicky that i see a lot of this as an effort to calm people down
1452814 the whole bill is an attempt to change the equilibrium
1452815 clearly in areas where home prices have dropped its going to be utilized more
1452816 it also depends on the borrowers unique financial circumstances why are they struggling did they lose their job if its a temporary hardship then youre not going to use this program at all if its something of greater significance then this may be the best option
1452817 how effective can the fha refinancing program be in light of how slow and ineffective mortgage servicers have been so far
1452818 were encouraged that steps are being taken but were worried

1452824 we took the matter to the clubs all with one exception voted in favour of remaining at newlands
1452825 the sharks proposed that no test should be played anywhere but on the home ground of an affiliated union unless permission is granted
1452826 there is a lot of nostalgia attached to newlands but thats not what the decision was about
1452827 financially we will not be better off if we move there are only 150 suites in the new stadium and we would have had to build new ones
1452828 that means one would be paying to upgrade someone elses property
1452829 we wrote to the city council the door is not completely closed the union is willing to listen to anyone and we will then take a well considered decision
1452830 our next move regarding the issue wont be soon it may be reconsidered in 2010
1452831 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1452832 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1452833 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1452834 it is a sports bra without metal or plastic so they will not be hurt as easily if there is a tussle
1452835 it is not a bullet proof bra but it can be worn under a bullet proof vest
1452836 in the case of a fight for example metal or plastic bits of a normal bra can break off causing injury to policewomen
1452837 the impact of a bullet on an underwire or a metal hook can seriously hurt a policewoman or even kill her

1452848 la prensa francesa habla mucho acerca de que yo podr a ser el sucesor de juninho pero no creo que sea as creo que somos dos jugadores muy diferentes l es un excelente jugador hace mucho tiempo que est en lyon y yo quiero seguir progresando
1452849 el sucesor de rivaldo juega en el olimpique de lyon
1452850 se trata de un paso important simo en mi vida como futbolista ya que el arsenal es un club muy grande
1452851 my yenta gave me your number and says we have to meet

1452853 i had a good time today when can we go out again
1452854 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1452855 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection

1452863 two million accounts for one fifth of the south african labour force cleary from a production point of view it will be a blemish to the economy for one day
1452864 a one day strike allows the economy the catch up and i doubt that two million people will be on strike i think around 100 000 is more realistic
1452865 workers should not be asked to pay for governments failure to invest in electricity in the late 1990s as a result of its plans to privatise eskom and did nothing when it was warned about the amount of investment that would be required to meet the expected rise in demand for power in the future

1452869 i am actually a really nice person a lot of times when i meet people for the first time i think they are taken back by how warm my energy actually is because they watch the shows and they just figure me to be this nasty angry negative person but what it was is that i had a lot of things coming at me i had girls to compete with and then i had guys in my house who were there for the wrong reasons you have to know i got that way because my buttons were pushed if im not on the battlefield fighting any battles im going to put my swords away so im good

1452923 it was actually a bit of an accident one of the biologists who was studying the mold sneezed and spilled some of her tea on it the sample shriveled up almost immediately and so of course we had to find out what was in the tea that made it so effective we were able to isolate the compound and
1452924 now if youll excuse me i need to get to my lab
1452925 i wouldnt go in quite yet if i were you rodney
1452926 you just said that it was all clear everybody else went inside
1452927 you didnt let me finish the compound that we located wasnt actually part of the tea itself it was an additive its a particular sort of citric acid
1452928 its lemon juice and according to your records youre violently allergic to it
1452929 im sorry but it looks like youre going to have to stay out here a while longer son i dont want you going into anaphylactic shock ill see if i can get john to bring you a tent and a bite to eat itll take until tomorrow at least to get rid of the mold and clean everything up again
1452930 if this works ill be right here when you come out
1452931 my holographic matrix is compromised we have to hurry the shield is only barely holding against the radiation of the star and we have another problem
1452932 sensors indicate that the star is beginning to collapse its going to go supernova when it does this planet and atlantis will be destroyed
1452933 but if this works then you will soon see my younger self again ive rerouted power to the transporters and stargate operations systems but we do not have long
1452934 systems are failing all over the city life support is barely functioning now but it wont need to for much longer now come on young man
1452935 the star is beginning to collapse i estimate we only have minutes before it collapses then explode into a supernova
1452936 the wormhole will return you there a couple of days after you left its the best i could calculate it im sorry
1452937 thanks to you ive got a chance to fix what went wrong
1452938 lets see what happens the next time your plumbing goes on the fritz
1452939 john should we not have invited rodney to join us
1452940 hes read these already besides hes probably holed up in his lab going over the reports from all the new systems the ancients started up while they were here
1452941 i know what youre thinking but i swear we didnt know you were there rodney
1452942 i was just showing them the far side book i won last night
1452943 i was going to ask if you wanted to join us
1452944 oh like i have nothing better to do than explain cow jokes to the pegasus galaxys version of tarzan and jane
1452945 and you wonder why people dont want to sit with you
1452946 i need to see you and your team in the control room
1452947 you did tell your team that this wasnt an urgent matter
1452948 the malp we sent to mss 696 sent back some images that i really think you should see
1452949 you dragged us all the way down here to show us a jungle
1452950 thats what i want you and your team to go and find out
1452951 its asgard there was one just like it on cimmeria
1452952 seriously dont you people ever read the sgc mission reports
1452953 cimmeria was the first planet we encountered the asgard thats where sg 1 met the hologram version of thor as in thors hammer any of this ringing a bell
1452954 the asgard were one of the four ancient races that formed an alliance thousands of years ago along with the nox the furlings and the ancients we had always assumed that the four races had come together in the milky way galaxy but if this stone pillar is asgard
1452955 then maybe the ancients and the asgard go back even farther
1452956 no offence but isnt this more of an archaeological thing maybe we should send one of the anthro teams to check it out
1452957 elizabeth please enlighten the ranking military officer of atlantis on what a find like this means
1452958 we need to know what the asgard were doing here we have never before encountered asgard technology in the pegasus galaxy and the asgard have never mentioned anything about having been here which leads me to believe that their presence here was either marginal
1452959 your home will always be with me i need you with me i miss you and you know it
1452960 i miss you rodney god i miss you so much you have to know that right
1452961 ive made my decision john and i will not change my mind im teaching and i like what i do i cant come back to you to the city or even the sgc i simply cant theres just been too much going on time does not heal all wounds after all
1452962 i couldnt do it any more couldnt take it any more john before i knew you people didnt matter to me i didnt care if they liked me or not i never really expected them to like me in the first place why would they its never happened before im not a nice person im rude and sarcastic i make people cry and i made a mistake it was only a matter of time until i would fuck up john elizabeth was right not to trust me any more and even though you came round soon enough i couldnt stay there any more not even for you it was too much it would have killed me sooner or later
1452963 something inside me died that day rodney and i need you to come fix me make me whole again i cant live like that any more rodney
1452964 i want it back just like it used to be i want our life back the way it was when you still were in love with me
1452965 you cant have that back john im just not strong enough
1452966 you are the strongest person i know you can do everything you set your mind to you were the one to save our asses on the last possible minute time and time again youre a genius a scientist and over time you turned into at least as good a soldier as any of my marines please rodney give us give me another chance we all miss you and want you to come back i know youre scared that something like after doranda can happen again but im sure it wont all you need to do is find the courage to take the chance i know you can do it you can face your demons you can come back to me the place is just like you left it you know we even have a new lab or two all im asking for is a second chance
1452967 i wish i could give you a second chance john i swear id love nothing more than to come back but i cant im only human and im going to mess up again get people killed again i cant live like that any more please i beg you please dont ask that of me its too late john
1452968 ill of course accept your decision rodney if thats how you want to play it i understand that we hurt you that i hurt you youre living by your own rules now guess that makes sense
1452969 im sorry john but i warned you it would end badly remember
1452970 what do you want you over grown pit bull im a busy man and youre interfering with what could mean the fate of the universe by your childish games
1452971 well yes yes what if i am im entitled to eat something im sure you understand you walking stomach im hungry and if i dont get something to eat you know my blood sugar will drop and then ill fall into hypoglycemic coma
1452972 so i burn a lot of calories with my genius brain something you will never understand so either get out of my way or tell me what the hell you want
1452973 what do you mean what was i doing with my mouth im talking thats what im doing with it do you understand the words that are coming out
1452974 i meant just before i stopped you like right now
1452975 wait youve been here how long and youve never seen anyone chewing gum
1452976 or to be more precise bubblegum or should i say sugar free bubblegum because though i need sugar for it to come in the form of gum can actually be bad for my teeth
1452977 oh well 1 bubble gum is a type of chewing gum that is especially designed for blowing bubbles it is usually pink in color and has a particular flavor it was accidentally discovered in 1928 by walter diemer who was working in a chewing gum factory somewhere in philadelphia thats a city on earth
1452978 um well simply put bubblegum is made from a 2 gum base with some form of powdered sugar or a sugar substitute then a form of corn syrup or again some type of substitute and some glycerin along with some citric acid not the kind you find in death fruit like oranges and lemons thank god or id be dead by now which is why im picky on what flavors i get oh yeah flavoring is the last ingredient plus a ton of preservatives and what not depending on what kind of gum you get
1452979 well i think i made it clear its for chewing
1452980 its a flavored chewing stick with which i can make bubbles see
1452981 when im done with it i throw it away as its not a food does that satisfy your neanderthal brain of yours can i go get real food now
1452982 id ah love to but ah that was um my last piece im sure i can
1452983 you use your teeth and tongue to stretch the gum out over your tongue and then you pull back your tongue and blow into the thinned material until an air pocket or bubble forms the bigger the better
1452984 you know its never wise to make them too big
1452985 your own fault you yeti you stole it without knowing what to do with it dont blame me
1452986 come on romeo ill help you get the gum out of your beard without serious destruction being done to the city or your face
1452987 i am but i have mres in my quarters and what we need to get that stuff out while were there we can discuss that kiss you gave me
1452988 this speaks to their motivation work ethic diligence and persistence
1452989 those are huge things second it also speaks to the goal they have to enter into professional life they commit to this 150 percent i am not reducing by any means traditional college students who get degrees everyone works hard but esl students have life altering experiences that deal with identity and motivations their experience has to do with maintaining ties with the language and culture of their countries while at the same time broadening themselves to the american experience
1452990 these students sit around the table with students from other countries and examine how they interpret events differently they come to understand and appreciate individual differences in the workplace these are huge skills especially in our changing world with its emphasis on the globalized workplace and globalized communications
1452991 when we professors visit the hospital we see our students giving us x rays and its very common for us to go to restaurants where they are the managers we tend to visit local businesses and hear teacher only to turn around and see a student
1452992 i think all the faculty here are motivated by the motivation of the students who come here with a lot of obstacles they have families or theyve left the connections in their countries and they are working or studying here 12 hours a week everybody is more motivated to try to help the students really succeed and in many ways the school is really a place for them to make human connections if you talk to students their greatest difficulty is isolation
1452993 in terms of teaching the language we integrate american culture at all levels teaching about the american government system the health system and education systems
1452994 obviously in terms of across new jersey we are continuing to try to find ways for students to meet their goals
1452995 i think that these esl programs should be valued and cherished without the vehicle of the english language students cannot be successful in this society whether it is getting a job making friends or obtaining a higher education degree this is the key to their success to learn this language as well as they can in this way they can progress in life no matter what their goals are
1452996 me estoy preparando para el tour por am rica del sur que comenzar realmente pronto este tour es algo que he estado esperando por mucho tiempo y no exagero al comentarles que es uno de mis m s grandes sue os poder llevar a cabo un tour por este continente
1452997 muy pronto los ensayos para el tour se llevar n a cabo en la ciudad de mexico y estoy ansiosa por ver como kiko loureiro guitarrista y el resto comienzan a rockear estoy realmente ansiosa preparen sus c maras para filmar en los shows porque realmente no sabremos cu ndo volver a suceder algo de estas caracter sticas
1452998 uno de los puntos m s claves de este tour para m ser visitar nuevamente la ciudad de guadalajara
1452999 shields are operational but only at sixty percent at this present time one of my teams are working as quickly as they can to get them back to full strength but several of the control crystals in the serge protectors are blown so we are having to adapt some spare crystals from the daedalus to do the job
1453000 well thats no surprise given the stress the shields were put under during the escape from taranis
1453001 all weapons systems remain off line we cant even get power to the drone launchers and im still trying to figure out why
1453002 we need those weapons doc were only three hours from intercepting the wraith ships
1453003 i know that major me and my team are doing the best we can to give them to you
1453004 but first we have to isolate why power isnt getting from the main reactors to the weapons grid
1453005 now that we know their off line i think so ill have to go down to engineering and check them excuse me
1453006 zelenka to bridge power regulators are back online please try powering up the weapons grid
1453007 now we just need to get our shields back to full strength then well be ready to teach the wraith the price for betraying us
1453008 all missile firing safeties have been disabled well be able to fire every missile weve got the moment we exit hyperspace exiting hyperspace in ten seconds
1453009 launch the moment the target is acquired dont wait for my order
1453010 quite a lot of them sir theyre moving to intercept our missiles
1453011 because if its our guys then our chances of surviving this just went back above zero only by a faction mind you
1453012 if its our guys its all the more reason to sabotage this ship and help them win the battle
1453013 one of your ships has appeared and launched an attack
1453014 there first strike has inflicted serious damage upon this hive the other hive is undamaged and is moving to engage
1453015 are we going to go through the whole thing play by play or are we going to get out of here
1453016 one of the hives has sustained severe damage their propulsion systems appear to be down there drifting and in an uncontrolled counter clockwise spin the other hive is moving to engage us
1453017 sir the damaged hive is launching more darts and two cruisers have just disengaged from their bays
1453018 there weapons systems appear to be at full power and their shields are at full strength
1453019 the darts are moving to strafe the orion and the operational hive and both cruisers are targeting them
1453020 we cant help them with the hive and the cruisers but we can still take some of the heat off them
1453021 ready the main cannon target drones on one of the flanking cruisers
1453022 the wraith are not idiots you know any system with the potential to destroy the ship is heavily protected by encryption codes and firewalls that i am trying to bypass and weve got another problem a great many systems are damaged but are regenerating rapidly theyll be capable of returning to hyperspace in moments
1453023 then we dont have a lot of time rodney let mikey have a go at it
1453024 sounds like a major free for all raging out there
1453025 a lantean warship has joined the battle against these hives
1453026 theyve just destroyed the other hive and are currently engaged with a cruiser i thought all the lantean battlecruisers were destroyed in the war
1453027 thats most likely the orion we salvaged her from a planet called taranis a few weeks ago
1453028 the queen has changed the access codes it would take too long for me to bypass them the ventral hyperdrive generators have been regenerated the hyperdrive cores are starting to power back up
1453029 i dont fancy getting caught again by the wraith and shoved back in that cocoon
1453030 the aft hanger bay is very close by follow me
1453031 well have to use drones sir their out of our main weapons range
1453032 target the drones on the wraiths hyperspace generators we cannot let them get away
1453033 he hit his head pretty hard seems to be completely out of it
1453034 the orions firing on this ship now we should get off or well be destroyed with the ship
1453035 breathing is shallow and his pulse is erratic we need to get him medical attention and quickly
1453036 yeah well the daedalus and the orion both have medical facilities that could save him
1453037 that is if the they dont destroy us the moment we leave the hive
1453038 were leaving the bay now colonel sheppard it might be prudent if you come over here ill hail your ships the moment were clear of the hive
1453039 i hate to interrupt the celebrations at the destruction of the wraith fleet but i believe you should know that a single wraith transport left the wraith hiveship moments before it was destroyed
1453040 sensors read four life signs on the transport one is wraith the other three are human one of the human life signs is quite faint indicating unconsciousness
1453041 then put the hail from the wraith transport on speakers
1453042 repeating this is lieutenant colonel john sheppard authentication code bravo delta charlie alpha nine to the daedalus and orion respond please
1453043 yes sir he helped us escape the hive sir can you beam us over immediately rodney is quite badly hurt and needs immediate medical attention
1453044 understood well beam you over immediately michael can park that transport in our starboard hanger bay
1453045 understood colonel ive deactivated the jamming code so you can beam over your people
1453046 marks beam sheppard mckay and ronon directly to the infirmary
1453047 and keep an eye on michaels transport if he looks like doing anything suspicious blast him out of the sky
1453048 navigation once the transport has docked turn the ship around and head back to atlantis i imagine theyre getting a bit anxious back there now advise major lorne on the orion to do the same
1453049 sensors are tracking michaels ship heading back towards the pegasus galaxy shall we pursue sir
1453050 hes not worth the effort of chasing down right now we can deal with michael at another time
1453051 we should get underway ourselves is the course for atlantis set
1453052 the orion has acknowledge the course plot and are ready to execute on your command
1453053 intact and with no appreciable damage beyond a few overstress shield generators
1453054 and thats not all colonel sheppard doctor mckay and ronon dex have all turned up alive doctor mckay has a nasty concussion but hell recover
1453055 mr woolsey was in the control room with me when the message from atlantis came in he said hell convene the ioa in the morning to discuss the results of the mission
1453056 no doubt theyll give you a few pats on the back given that the mission you ordered passed off without a hitch
1453057 get some rest your going to need it for the morning
1453058 now that i know everything is fine ill be able to sleep
1453059 resulta incre ble pero puerto viejo padece constantemente de problemas de agua a veces no se pueden ni lavar los servicios sanitarios a pesar de que talamanca es uno de los cantones que tiene m s y mejores recursos h dricos tambi n la electricidad falla constantemente ni siquiera hay un relleno sanitario no hay programas de capacitaci n para los j venes etc

1453156 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1453157 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1453158 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1453159 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1453160 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel
1453161 estamos haciendo m s publicidad y la publicidad fortalece a los movimientos terroristas
1453162 s lo pueden implantar el terror si se habla de ellos
1453163 el error que comete el estado de derecho con la reducci n de la condena y la excarcelaci n es que de juana est consiguiendo una segunda rentabilidad por sus m s de 20 asesinatos
1453164 no estamos preparados para eso desde el 2001 no hab amos recibido ning n ping ino por aqu y desde el 17 de julio pasado ya hemos recibido cerca de 500

1453179 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
1453180 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
1453181 id like to see something from the liquidators this is a massive task daniel and i are run off our feet there should be legal aid for investors and a law firm appointed by the government as statutory manager which we would assist

1453189 he called a child whom he put among them and said truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
1453190 children are in need of knowledge ignorant of good and evil among other things they need to learn
1453191 first you must work on the child reconstruct the universe that the child lost you cant forget that the child has the right to be a child
1453192 find their own strategies both to provide support and to elicit it from others
1453193 learning from other groups that have experience in this area

1453195 jesus placed special importance on receiving with kindness and hospitality the least important members of society children

1453198 music is part of the movement against human slavery dr cornel west connects the music of the american slave fields to the popular music we listen to today and offers this connection as a rallying cry for the modern abolitionist movement currently brewing
1453199 it is hard to imagine a more grotesque abuse of authority or flagrant violation of childrens rights
1453200 my friends and i were walking by the national palace one evening when we encountered a couple of humanitarian men the men called us over and showed us their penises they offered us 100 haitian gourdes 2 80 and some chocolate if we would suck them i said no but some of the girls did it and got the money
1453201 people dont report it because they are worried that the agency will stop working here and we need them
1453202 must own up to the fact that they are vulnerable to this problem and tackle it head on
1453203 oxfam takes a zero tolerance approach to sexual misconduct by its aid workers all our staff across the world are held accountable by a robust code of conduct
1453204 we support save the childrens calls for a global watchdog we will do all we can to stamp out this intolerable abuse
1453205 not all johns are rapists of course and im uncomfortable calling anyone who sleeps with a trafficked girl a rapist even though she is being forced to have sex against her will
1453206 its been somewhat embarrassing to me and frustrating to see the united states refuse among all the other nations in the world including the united nations to deal with the maoists when they did make major steps away from combat and away from subversion into an attempt at least to play an equal role in a political society
1453207 its the end i hope of armed conflict of revolutionary war in fact

1453209 an analysis of the idea of the atonement in hinduism in the light of christianity
1453210 does it really make much of a difference when a nepali hindu becomes a christian both believe in doing good works even in loving ones neighbors its just a question of motive hindus accumulate merit from their good deeds to counterbalance their bad deeds christians says that a life full of good deeds cannot outweigh even a single sin we must first seek forgiveness from god relying on his mercy shown to us through his son jesus christ then once forgiven he enables us to do good out of thankfulness and love for him who died for us
1453211 do so by giving the state control over the lives and businesses of those who work as prostitutes legalization often includes special taxes for prostitutes restricting prostitutes to working in brothels or in certain zones licenses registration of prostitutes and government records of individual prostitutes and health checks which often means punitive quarantine the term legalization does not necessarily have to refer to the above sorts of regulations in fact in one commonly accepted definition of legalization legal can simply mean that prostitution is not against the law
1453212 is giving me at the moment is again a visual issue
1453213 they called my boyfriend and said they were me and said i had sex with his bestfriend and said i did a bunch of crap and hated him well now there telling me off and im sick of this

1453217 as he marches toward inauguration day election day is but a milestone on that path obamas biggest challenger may not be republican
1453218 one source of the confidence is the polling which shows him with a big lead over mccain but polls are fickle allies a
1453219 obama was waxing lyrical about last weeks trip to europe when he concluded according to the meeting attendee
1453220 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1453221 richard weaver taught us that ideas have consequences we must tell each other now that ideas have also roots and learn how to think by going to the radix the root of our disunities one byproduct of that kind of effort is that we learn not to blame others as we come to see ourselves as part of the problem
1453222 a government must appeal to its citizens in terms of competence realism sobriety and personal character
1453223 sometimes its important to state the obvious as george orwell urged in another era of big lies and political correctness
1453224 looks like the mccain camp was on the same wavelength
1453225 its disingenuous when people say they dont want to legalise it
1453226 right now its uncontrolled and unregulated theres no check and balance as far as the womens health is concerned and legal brothels could be an important revenue raising device for the city
1453227 when you speak about it intellectually not morally it makes sense
1453228 if we had a referendum or ballot on legal brothels it would probably pass
1453229 there are women who get propositioned in the casinos bars and hotels
1453230 there are women who do extras out of strip clubs and who give pleasure in massage parlours women who do what we term outcall going to specific apartments to spend erotic time with gentlemen
1453231 there are women who work by print ads or on line and every casino host has a bevy of girls to call at a moments notice to satisfy their high rollers
1453232 the number one problem according to the fbi is asian prostitution
1453233 that means asian organised crime and human trafficking into the us straight into las vegas and its all fuelled by money
1453234 they could be huge in las vegas it would be great for the women and for our industry which is today fragile because it remains a teeny business in a big state
1453235 i think its morally and ethically wrong for governments to say its ok to sell humans in that way the government should not pimp the girls
1453236 empower the women who do the work give them labour protection and the rights given other workers because its a job and a choice for many women
1453237 theres too much money to be made from the illegal sex trade the casinos and convention industry fear it would be a step too far
1453238 you always hope that your work will eventually be used to do some good in the world and this was an amazing chance to make that hope real
1453239 analysts were getting overwhelmed by all of the data they had to sift through
1453240 the programme uses pattern recognition and will work even if the pattern has been modified
1453241 so if police can identify a pattern such as a calendar on the wall or a t shirt logo they have a much better chance of finding the exploited child and catching the suspect
1453242 criminals are using cutting edge technology to commit their crimes of child sexual exploitation and in fighting to solve those crimes and keep children safe we must do the same
1453243 makes me proud of your passion julia you are really in this all the way arent you tears are running down my cheeks as i think of you and your future fear of what your future might hold as well as excitement of what changes you may make in lives through your work my heart is full of graditude to god for a child like you go and make a difference julia tattoo and all you have my blessing

1453292 if everyone were warm and well fed we should lose the satisfaction of admiring the fortitude with which certain conditions of men bear cold and hunger and if we were no better off than anybody else what would become of our sense of gratitude which is one of the holiest feelings of our common nature

1453297 die micromachine ist f r den bereich mikroelektromechanischer systeme die weltweit beste veranstaltung
1453298 der workshop hat bei uns zu verst rkter nachfrage gef hrt
1453299 the inventions licensed to oxford nanopore resulted from strong collaboration across multiple disciplines at harvard and also with academic colleagues from outside of the university
1453300 this work and the agreement announced today are further validation of harvards strong commitment to collaboration and innovation and to ensuring that the work of our scientists is extended to benefit society more broadly
1453301 we are proud to collaborate with this world class research team harvards long record of excellence in nanopore research means that this agreement encompasses many aspects of nanopore technology through this partnership and agreements with other prestigious institutions oxford nanopore takes the leading position in transforming nanopores from science into technologies that will benefit researchers and people everywhere
1453302 in the area of micro electro mechanical systems the exhibition micromachine mems is the worlds best event
1453303 the workshop has lead to an increased demand at our company
1453304 we look forward to bringing this test to market to provide oncologists with an evidence based tool to monitor individual patient dosing based upon their plasma 5 fu concentration level as a result physicians will be better able to manage their patients and make more confident decisions in colorectal cancer treatment
1453305 the ability to personalize chemotherapy is a significant advance in the treatment of cancer and one that will lead to improved efficacy and fewer side effects for patients individually adjusted chemotherapy dosing provides great benefits to patients a meaningful new tool for oncologists and cost savings to the health care system
1453306 access to a new laboratory tool to monitor the actual drug concentration in patients blood and to adjust 5 fu dose to minimize toxicity and maximize the therapeutic benefit promises to improve outcomes
1453307 this is what microfluidics does best it enables smaller yet more powerful systems to be developed systems that may have been laboratory based can become more portable or even hand held and at the same time can have increased accuracy and repeatability
1453308 the real challenge with this project was the fusing of such large etched glass plates
1453309 aligning the plates to ensure the etched microchannels were perfectly matched took a great deal of experience and put our capabilities to quite a test
1453310 this funding will allow us to explore largely uncharted capabilities and applications that are inherent in our core technologies
1453311 this seed funding will support a proof of concept demonstration of our capabilities if successful we will be seeking larger amounts of funding for continued development for this brand new application of our technology
1453312 we are pleased that darpa is supporting this research as it may enable a whole series of new grants and contracts from the government
1453313 while there are specific military needs and goals associated with this contract the success of this program will enable commercial non military applications and products addressing markets such as diagnostics chemical sensing analytics and others we hope this initial funding will lead to additional contracts and an additional portfolio of products for military and commercial markets
1453314 these states are ones you learn about in introductory quantum mechanics classes but no one has been able to controllably create them before
1453315 in quantum mechanics the energy or amplitude of motion of this pendulum only comes in finite steps in quanta we first carefully prepared the resonator in these quantum states and showed we could do this controllably and then measure the states then we kicked the pendulum directly a method where the amplitude can take on any value and appears to not be limited to these quanta but when we look at the resonator with our qubit we see that the amplitude does come in steps but that the resonator is actually in several such states at the same time so that on average it looks like it is not limited to the quantum states
1453316 this resonator once you excite it has to swing for a very long time
1453317 the first samples i fabricated stopped oscillating very quickly we had to work to rearrange the fabrication method to get the resonator to oscillate longer
1453318 harmonic oscillators might allow us to get a quantum computer built more quickly
1453319 the expanded agreement with nanogen gives us the opportunity to open up our potential market by providing full panels of diagnostics for respiratory illnesses
1453320 the rapid accurate diagnosis of these infectious diseases will enable quicker treatment and recovery times for patients
1453321 our r amp d efforts on the cdc hx avian influenza project have resulted in a next generation rapid diagnostic technology with breakthrough improvements in sensitivity and precision
1453322 expanding our relationship with hx diagnostics to include additional respiratory disease diagnostics is a good way for nanogen to leverage the technology and fulfill our mission of enabling better patient care by bringing to market easier and faster diagnostics
1453323 well knowing that one mohammed ali alias abdallah mohammed fazul alias abdalla abdul karim alias harun fazul alias adan hussein ali mirza did on the november 20 2002 at kikambala murder 15 people received him in malindi in december 2007 maintained him and helped him to escape punishment
1453324 it is an open secret that the west has been establishing a buffer zone around russia during the recent years getting european baltic states ukraine and the caucasus involved in the process the expansion of the russian military presence abroad particularly in cuba could become a response to us led activities
1453325 there are convenient bays for reconnaissance and battleships and a network of so called forward staging posts in cuba we can resume the operation of the radar center in lourdes upon the agreement of the cuban administration a shipment of new radar equipment will be necessary for it though
1453326 it is technically possible although there is no strategic need in it today

1453338 tsvangirai may be lured into accepting a power sharing arrangement which would lead to mugabe succeeding himself through puppets from zanu pf
1453339 the best option for tsvangirai is to insist that mugabe becomes a ceremonial president with executive powers vested in the prime minister

1453342 for me the sport is very attractive and demanding and also in a kind of way spectacular
1453343 you have to be totally cooled down in chess coming out of the boxing round the adrenaline is the problem
1453344 in particular the nba must reject this affront on the judiciary by the attorney general
1453345 the justice of this case is that parties to this suit should maintain the status quo so that the subject matter will not be destroyed
1453346 the subject matter is southern bakassi which is to be ceded by the defendants on august 14
1453347 it is hereby ordered that parties should maintain the status quo and should not take any step pending the hearing of all applications justice umar had ruled
1453348 a court order must be so explicit to the effect that the person who is bound by it should be able to comply
1453349 in this case the order poses a dilemma because it does not state which status quo to maintain at the time it was enrolled by the judge
1453350 the status quo that i know is that there is a judgment of the international court of justice at the hague which the federal government had partly implemented and must implement completely
1453351 to file the necessary motions to overturn the ruling and i think he will do that on friday
1453352 our country has a commitment to hand over the peninsula by august 14 and so far nothing has changed
1453353 if there are legal hurdles the president is fully committed to addressing those hurdles so that the handover can go on as planned nigeria will not abandon its sovereign responsibilities and international obligations
1453354 it is known fact that about 90 per cent of the bakassi returnees are indigenes of this state since this crisis our people have been living in shanties and in abject poverty because resources released for their resettlement have been channelled to the wrong quarters
1453355 so as to learn first hand how to manage emergency situation
1453356 we are in a very problematic situation today especially the israeli embassies abroad because of the threats that we got from the terrorist organisation the hezbollah to strike israeli embassies in west africa
1453357 though they did not speak about a specific country but there is intelligence and information that speak about this possibility
1453358 are also aware and they are doing all in their power to ensure that anything doesnt go wrong
1453359 the first thing that is very important to us is for you to be informed and assist us to protect this place and to give us information
1453360 this is the reason that we need maximum help from your men to help in this situation
1453361 i mean we got the reports yesterday and it is retaliation for the murder of one of the hezbollah big operators the ahmoniyah which happened in february
1453362 i would like to seize this opportunity of course we will discuss it more at length in respect to our security here i mean whatever we need from your organisation is always unbelievable
1453363 my security officer and myself we are very happy we are very happy we feel that the level of security provided by the nigerian police at the embassy is satisfactory
1453364 i myself i feel very confident here and i think that in a situation where the political or global situation all over the world with a lot of threats in our hands what to do israel has been exposed and is still being exposed to all kinds of threats
1453365 the purpose of my coming is to find out what is the security needs of the embassy if there are some shortcomings on the part of the nigeria police force to see how we can put those shortcomings straight tighten the loose ends and ensure that we provide you with adequate security
1453366 if julius berger could decide to pull out of the niger delta region because of the alleged disturbances by the youths one expected that such decision should be taken with the recent happening in abuja
1453367 in line with their policy of withdrawing from areas of harassment in nigeria this should not be a difficult directive after the incident on friday august 01 2008 when one of its vehicles was burnt by an irate mob in abuja
1453368 had this same scenario occurred in the niger delta region the army would have been called upon to open fire on the mob then brand them as militants
1453369 mend expects julius berger a company which has benefited tremendously from the niger delta region where its crude oil was used as barter payment in most cases for the building of abuja to apply the same policy of leaving troubled areas as it did when it recently quit the niger delta region
1453370 failure to vacate its staff from construction sites and halt all on going projects in the fct abuja on the deadline will result in unprecedented deadly attacks on the expatriate staff of julius berger inside abuja and other parts of the country until they comply
1453371 or we would be left with no option than to pay back which will be catastrophic

1453389 o obama que discursou hoje noite n o colocou todas as suas cartas sobre a mesa ele tentou usar o simbolismo de berlim para indicar que como presidente ir se aproximar da europa mas nas entrelinhas ele disse bem claramente que a europa precisa fazer mais especialmente quanto ao afeganist o e ao iraque
1453390 uma crise da confian a norte americana na globaliza o poderia fazer com que todo o processo perdesse o rumo
1453391 neste s culo precisamos de uma uni o europ ia forte que intensifique a seguran a e a prosperidade deste continente e que ao mesmo tempo estenda uma m o para o exterior
1453392 n o creio que a europa seja uma quest o de grande import ncia para obama o que importa para ele o apoio que os europeus podem dar s pol ticas dele
1453393 obama apelou para uma dose de demagogia pr germ nica sobre armas nucleares com o objetivo de se aplaudido

1453395 a little peasant was brought to me to be cross examined it was in the provinces at the time when we still believed in the flower garden theory as you call it cross examinations were conducted in a very gentlemanly way the peasant had buried his crops it was the beginningof the collectivization of the land i kept strictly to the prescribed etiquette i explained to him in a friendly way that we needed the corn to feed the growing city population and for export in order to build up our industries so would he please tell me where he haad hidden his crops the peasant had his head drawn into his shoulders when he was brought into my room expecting a beating i knew his kind i am myself country born when instead of beating him i began to reason with him to talk to him as an equal and call him citizen he took me for a half wit i saw it in his eyes i held strictly to the regulations it never even occurred to me that there were other methods
1453396 the third hearing of my man took place at two oclock at night i had previously worked for eighteen hours on end he had been woken up he was drunk with sleep and frightened he betrayed himself from that time i cross examined my people chiefly at night once a woman complained that she had been kept standing outside my room the whole night awaiting her turn her legs were shaking and she was completely tired out in the middle of the hearing she fell asleep i woke her up she went on talking in a sleepy mumbling voice without fully realizing what she was saying and fell asleep again i woke her once more and she admitted everything and signed the statement without reading it in order that i should let her sleep that the wife had been kept waiting on her feet the whole night was due to the carelessness of my sergeant from then onwards i encouraged carelessness of that kind stubborn cases had to stand upright on one spot for as long as forty eight hours after that the wax had melted out of their ears and one could talk to them

1453399 more than two dozen current and former high ranking executives at freddie mac analysts shareholders and regulators said in interviews that mr syron had ignored recommendations that could have helped avoid the current crisis
1453400 the thinking was that if something really bad happened to the housing market then the government would need freddie and fannie more than ever and would have to rescue them everybody understood that at some level the company was putting taxpayers at risk

1453495 the war on terror is an absolute fraud i said this over two years ago and it remains more obviously true two years hence it is a war designed specifically to mask the injustices and inequalities which afflict millions of americans by aggravating and amplifying the injustices and inequalities inflicted upon millions of non americans its very existence represents continuous and ever expanding victory for only the most vicious opportunistic and hateful elements among humanity who will impose upon us tragedy upon tragedy and terror upon terror until we break cleanly and completely from the rotted chains of mindless fealty to false national leaders and forge links with those abroad whose friendships we have forgone for far too long
1453496 i am overwhelmingly pleased that the rand corporation has concluded that the war on terror is a hoax and that military efforts to deal with terrorism have always been ineffective
1453497 it is also not surprising that the rand corporation further suggests that a second aspect of a counterterrorism effort would minimize the use of
1453498 although it should have been obvious many years ago i am nevertheless pleased at the rand corporation has finally concluded that terrorist organizations end either because of operations carried out by police and intelligence agencies or because they join the political process not because of timothy mcveigh was brought to an end through his home state the terrorism in ended with a political solution showing the futility of years of military action

1453517 students deserve to learn in an environment that is nurturing and conducive to learning unfortunately mayor bloomberg has continued a policy started under former mayor giuliani that relies on aggressive police tactics that interfere with learning and makes school a hostile place for students particularly children of color who attend schools in low income neighborhoods
1453518 when police personnel are not adequately trained and supported to work in schools they too often end up treating minor disciplinary infractions as criminal violations they become enforcers of cell phone prohibitions dress codes and food bans being late to class or writing on your desk should never be a criminal act but our kids are getting arrested for it

1453540 it was an incredible moment when we realized the figures we were getting in they had not been previously recorded because these are very remote areas that are quite inaccessible and logistically tough to survey
1453541 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals

1453652 macarthur advertiser are just not acceptable given mcguires um tenuous and difficult position at nine as failed ceo and tv presenter sans show he cant afford to look like a patsy at this crucial stage of his career
1453653 for those players to be out from a football perspective six days before a game when they have had an eight day break is just unacceptable and then to top it off by being dishonest to the people in an environment where you rely on honesty and you rely on trust is unforgivable buckley said
1453654 i think heath deserves everything he cops in all ways from the club but the one thing about it the lying part theres no doubt theres an unwritten law within footy clubs that you look after your mates and unless they do something that physically harms someone or something against the law
1453655 i the clubs just trying to make an example and they havent set the scene prior to this eddie mcguire will tell you ive rung him a number of times about different players doing different things off the field for nearly four to five years and i think that the protectionism that eddies trying to give the club to save their image in fact is detrimental to the very thing that you try to build and thats the culture

1453677 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1453678 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1453679 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain

1453684 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
1453685 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
1453686 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
1453687 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together
1453688 were the same three jerks we always were im actually quite proud of the fact that its gone on as long as it has
1453689 im in front of the stage and you literally see people break out into sobs or kiss each other and jump around expressing joy

1453699 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that

1453773 in december 2007 you decided to de register and de list the companys shares on the recommendation of symss controlling stockholder despite the strong protestations of esopus and other large minority holders today any reasonably informed minority shareholder would find that your actions directly caused a destruction in the market price of syms common shares and its accompanying liquidity and parenthetically should you entertain the concept of initiating a reverse stock split scheme or any functional equivalent in order to facilitate a future de registration of syms shares we will consider such action an improper discharge of your fiduciary duties to your minority stockholders

1453787 i was off down in the far south west of scotland staying at a wee fishing harbour which proved great for a few shots of nets crates and boats then up for a walk in the moorland it looks bleak from a distance but rich with vegetation when you get out and explore the moorland flowers are tiny but exquisite made me want to learn so much more about their names and how to take better photos of them
1453788 i can never know if a case will be successful it is up to the judge but i have done three months of research and i believe we are right theyre not just going to give in to our suit theyre going to fight like crazy to keep the regime of corporate welfare going
1453789 being a member of free new york does not have anything to do with my involvement in the lawsuit its just a coincidence free new york has a prime objective to abolish corporate welfare which is an identical goal of the lawsuit however free new york is not a litigation organization the lawsuit and free new york just happen to share the same goal

1453802 republicans are getting traction on drilling and it could hurt democrats in the general election
1453803 he still doesnt think drilling is the answer and if he was latching onto that rhetoric id be more concerned
1453804 we are disappointed to see that sen obama has expressed openness to compromise on offshore drilling and the health of our beaches when oil savings from his proposals for more efficient vehicles would better serve our needs save consumers money and enhance the economy
1453805 they both agree that the long term solution lies not in oil drilling but in development of alternatives
1453806 hes obviously following the leader which is senator mccain in my view hes the one who came there first but kudos to senator obama for that its important to face facts and realize whats going on and try to help people

1453809 last year we were proud to have the challenge of playing one of the toughest schedules in the country
1453810 i believe this schedule certainly compares favorably to any weve put together since weve been at georgia we will be challenged at home and at some tough places on the road i also think its a schedule that our fans can get excited about and start making plans for a great season all of us are looking forward to building upon the great ending to our season last march
1453811 we are honored to be playing in the nit season tip off
1453812 i think it speaks well to our programs accomplishments that we will represent the sec in the field it will give our young team some great experience early in the season
1453813 i think for division i student athletes its a wake up to reality and its a definite influence on their perspective
1453814 sometimes you can get so bogged down in the things youre doing and think that basketball is the end all every day
1453815 i think our guys get a sense of reward on one hand playing with them and interacting i think they also walk away count their blessings and have a renewed perspective
1453816 so its the age old clich you give to get
1453817 the opportunities to go and give a little bit of time versus the rewards that come back are multiplied
1453818 they are fighting every day just for one more you almost cant bear to leave because its so inspiring
1453819 to think that a normal day is to undergo treatments at a hospital to be home to be with your friends to play sports what we take for granted is so rare for someone else you definitely find a new sense of reality
1453820 i cry every time every time i dont know if its the motherly instinct i look around thinking that any one of those children could be my mine or just that pure inspiration that comes from seeing a five year old who has endured 12 surgeries or another who is about to go back into the hospital for a bone marrow transplant
1453821 our guys met one of the kids here who was a special spectator at a game in december whos about to go back into the hospital for eight weeks and they were talking on the way home about how long eight weeks in the hospital would be
1453822 eight weeks you know we get bent out of shape if we miss one practice what if you are removed from your entire surroundings not just what you love to do and your home for every day for eight weeks thats a long time particularly for a kid who is 10 or 11 years old
1453823 it was a big reality check for all of us i think
1453824 to go out and see what other people in the world are fighting
1453825 and the odds are stacked against them and their level of perseverance and their mindset it is always amazing to me the attitude and disposition of those kids
1453826 yeah just go through these glass doors and theres an elevator just down that hallway take that to field level and you can take it from there yeah that hallway right there basically where the cheerleaders are

1453831 our last game topped out at 8 bits weve heard this one might reach 9 or 10
1453832 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
1453833 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

1453836 its through language that we create the world because it is nothing until we describe it and when we describe it we create distinctions that govern our actions to put it another way we do not describe the world we see but we see the world we describe
1453837 yes and in my experience there is another way of understanding that situation

1453848 we are disturbed and concerned that news story after news story has cited federal law enforcement sources as the basis of information
1453849 any implication in that article or otherwise that the investigation has gained momentum from anything that my client has provided is false
1453850 frankly many divorcing parents dont handle the situation correctly and sadly act selfishly the innocent bystanders their children suffer the consequences which last long after the divorce
1453851 parents need to be more responsible in how they comport themselves during this tumultuous time from breaking this devastating news to their children to not badmouthing the ex in front of the children to simply allowing the child to love the other parent and shame on christie for making her children go through the public display of their fathers humiliation this may have made her feel vindicated but surely their children will be impacted forever
1453852 although many think divorce is not a big deal anymore because it is so common and socially acceptable the national child development study found otherwise children from disrupted families tend to do less well in school and subsequent careers than their peers they are also more likely to experience the break up of their own partnerships

1453856 i want to spend almost all my time on the stadium effort
1453857 i felt real good as soon as i started running
1453858 i felt like my old self like i felt my junior year in college so when i felt that way in my first practice i just wanted to keep going
1453859 mentally ive been ready to go for a long time
1453860 other than taking a hit which isnt going to affect my mindset there is really nothing ill be doing faster than in practice
1453861 there is no more testing it out to be done
1453862 nancy pelosis sacrilegious public support of abortion has resulted in untold loss of life we call on our catholic bishops our shepherds to lead us in showing reverence for the holy eucharist the body blood soul and divinity of jesus christ by enforcing canon 915
1453863 those who have been excommunicated or interdicted after the imposition or the declaration of a penalty as well as others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to communion
1453864 were seeing that abortion not only ends the life of a child it also endangers the life of that childs future siblings

1453871 the average age of the worlds greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years during those 200 years nations always progressed through the following sequences
1453872 i know my country has not perfected itself at times weve struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people weve made our share of mistakes and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions
1453873 i know my mother has not perfected herself at times she has struggled to keep the promise of fairness for all of her children she has made her share of mistakes and there are times when her actions around the town have not lived up to her best intentions
1453874 my country right or wrong is a thing that no patriot would think of saying
1453875 will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law
1453876 the fact that the pope desires to honor this great missionary figure a missionary to china which is a subject very much present nowadays in the popes prayers is something that should unite catholics
1453877 ogni essere umano che vuole la libert spiegano deve accendere una candela eun atto materiale e spirituale insieme come un voto un voto talmente numeroso che i leader mondiali non potranno ignorarlo
1453878 it is beyond me how one can possibly claim that a system whereby everyone your employer your union organizer and your co workers knows exactly how you vote on the issue of unionization gives an employee free choice
1453879 the employee free choice act would strip american workers of their right to a private ballot vote require companies to submit to binding arbitration and increase penalties for unfair labor practices committed by employers but not by unions each of these provisions would be bad for american workers
1453880 congress should instead protect the privacy of american workers and guarantee their right to vote in an election before joining a union congress should also guarantee every worker the opportunity to hear arguments from both sides and time to reflect before voting
1453881 we rarely showed workers what an actual union contract looked like because we knew that it wouldnt necessarily reflect what a worker would want to see
1453882 the union would provide the employees according to their priorities such as seniority or how much they favored that particular contractor
1453883 alienate a domestic constituency of tremendous political and financial import american jews it may more crucially mean sacrificing billions of dollars not in servicing israels military but actually investing in the state of palestine
1453884 anger at years of humiliation and loss of self respect because of israeli settlement expansion arafats imprisonment and israels incursions
1453885 it will be impossible to make progress on serious peace talks without putting the future of jerusalem on the table
1453886 one seemingly consistent theme running throughout barack obamas career is his comfort with aligning himself with people who are anti israel advocates
1453887 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
1453888 after it i leaned back and i said you cheated and he said why and i said i dont kiss on the first date then he said well i never really play by the rules
1453889 on one date the girl said to me i dont kiss on the first date
1453890 mr mundell wrote a wonderful story that has been successful for many years i admire him for that but we have the opportunity now to bring out a new story we would like to present an entire trilogy about the shawnee people with the first part being done in 2009 although that may have to wait until 2010
1453891 before that we need to stabilize finances and finalize a plan about how to go forward we owe mr mundell money we owe a lot of people money including myself
1453892 some of the bills stem from 2004 and 2005 the debt is not out of the ordinary for an outdoor drama so we hope to turn this around
1453893 i could just walk away from it and have nothing more to do with it or i could take action what i think should be done is being completely disregarded i will not cave in
1453894 a superstar is a person that has no fear of the world they step out there and they live life they are not afraid to be themselves and they live life to the fullest whether it be shoot going to l a tomorrow or going to iceland next month

1453903 actinic keratoses are caused by sun exposure and they are the precursor to skin cancer said dr
1453904 actinic keratoses can appear as red or brown spots or yellow discoloration
1453905 the levulan pdt treatment kills the visible aks in the same way that freezing or lasing kills them he said
1453906 but the beauty of pdt is that it also kills the cancerous cells that you cant see
1453907 that is what makes this such a great preventative treatment for skin cancer
1453908 the longer the incubation the deeper the levulan solution penetrates johnson said
1453909 the photo damaged cells absorb the levulan which is converted to light sensitive porphyrins porphyrins are naturally produced chemicals in cells the porphyrins react to the blue light and damage the cells that then die healthy cells are not affected
1453910 ive had one patient who quit after eight seconds and others who have sat through the entire time without any complaint he said
1453911 the level of burn depends on the amount of unseen photo damage
1453912 the levulan stays active for 24 hours after it is applied so we tell patients to stay out of the sun and put on sunscreen if they are going outdoors johnson said
1453913 receiving the treatment does not mean you never have to use sunscreen again said ronnie cameron clinical supervisor
1453914 if you lose a bunch of weight and start overeating again you will gain the weight back

1453918 playing with sammy was such a treat not just watching him hit and run but as a teammate you couldnt ask for a better person his constant smile and upbeat attitude were second to none its an honor to be able to say he was my teammate and more importantly my friend

1453921 dont lie to me i looked on the map and florida is a very thin state
1453922 would it be cheaper to fly to california and then take the train to hawaii
1453923 i heard dallas was a big airport and i need a car to drive between the gates to save time

1453937 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
1453938 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
1453939 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
1453940 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum

1454230 what is especially noticeable in these three writers is that they do not speak of the blessed virgin merely as the physical instrument of our lords taking flesh but as an intelligent responsible cause of it her faith and obedience being the accessories to the incarnation and gaining it as her reward as eve failed in these virtues and thereby brought on the fall of the race in adam so mary by means of the same had a part in its restoration
1454231 however not to go beyond the doctrine of the three fathers they unanimously declare that she was not a mere instrument in the incarnation such as david or judah may be considered they declare she co operated in our salvation not merely by the descent of the holy ghost upon her body but by specific holy acts the effect of the holy ghost within her soul that as eve forfeited privileges by sin so mary earned privileges by the fruits of grace that as eve was disobedient and unbelieving so mary was obedient and believing that as eve was a cause of ruin to all mary was a cause of salvation to all that as eve made room for adams fall so mary made room for our lords reparation of it and thus whereas the free gift was not as the offence but much greater it follows that as eve do operated in effecting a great evil mary co operated in effecting a much greater good
1454232 t he two persons are connected with each other by a mere accidental or moral unity the man christ is not god but a bearer of god the incarnation does not mean that god the son became man but merely that the divine logos resided in the man in the same manner as god dwells in the just the human activities birth suffering death may be asserted of the man christ only the divine activities creation omnipotence eternity of the god logos only consequently mary cannot in the proper sense be designated by the title customary since the time of origen of mother of god she is merely a bearer of man or mother of christ the conviction that in christ there are two persons appears also in the doctrine of authentication peculiar to the antiochians according to which the man christ was obliged to merit divine dignity and adoration by his obedience in suffering nestorian tendencies appear in the christology of early scholasticism also above all in the habitus theory which goes back to peter abelard and which was favoured by petrus lombardus which compares the assumption of human nature by the divine logos to the putting on of a garment st thomas condemns this as heresy since it implies a mere accidental unification s th iii 2 6

1454235 blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and keep it lk
1454236 my mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of god and do it
1454237 is jesus thereby distancing himself from his mother according to the flesh does he perhaps wish to leave her in the hidden obscurity which she herself has chosen if this seems to be the case from the tone of those words one must nevertheless note that the new and different motherhood which jesus speaks of to his disciples refers precisely to mary in a very special way is not mary the first of those who hear the word of god and do it and therefore does not the blessing uttered by jesus in response to the woman in the crowd refer primarily to her

1454271 harry is the main man everyone wants to play for him we want to achieve great things ive said from day one that i love the club and want to do more for the club
1454272 i want to do well for the fans theyre the best supporters in the premier league like the 12th man
1454273 fc barcelona and glasgow celtic have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of marc crosas to the scottish club
1454274 fc barcelona will receive a fixed price of 500 000 plus 900 000 worth of variables depending on the players participation qualification for the champions league and titles achieved
1454275 moreover fc barcelona received 25 of the economic factor of a possibly future transfer and an option to repurchase him at the end of the 2009 10 season for 2m
1454276 if nelly is missing then ill be able to captain the team which will be great ill be pleased with it
1454277 on the field hes a fantastic player he can make things happen hes got responsibilities now both on and off the pitch and i just thought it was the right idea
1454278 since ive come in hes been an excellent example not just to the young lads but to everybody else being a local lad i think its important and hes got leadership qualities
1454279 its a new position for me but im happy and i think im working well
1454280 i just want to improve in every way to get more time on the pitch i just want to demonstrate to the directors that they were not wrong in renewing my contract
1454281 it excites me because it always looked so great on tv
1454282 but its hard to play at villarreal because its a club thats constantly growing and the signings are becoming increasingly excellent

1454287 the tone method and content were all hideous we had rarely heard such strong and offensive comments made by an experienced professional about his colleague and were in italy
1454288 that doesnt even cover the errors which considering mourinhos perfectionism were probably planted there on purpose concerning ranieris age and trophy haul
1454289 what was truly ugly in his words was the extreme arrogance which had been glimpsed in his premier league experience but now we have experienced it first hand its even more direct and painful
1454290 clearly we are not scandalised and we dont want to censor jokes especially since it was ranieri who started this verbal tennis match a few days ago but there should never be a lack of respect not in any debate no matter how heated mourinho responded to a nudge with a punch in the face striking out at both ranieri and good taste
1454291 it would be a good thing if someone within the clubs administration reminds him that the line between personality and arrogance is a fine one moratti is not used to crossing that line

1454383 these convictions continue the string of successes in our crackdown on corporate fraud and our effort to restore integrity to our financial markets
1454384 lawyers who persist in this practice should have their computers confiscated
1454385 open ended indefinite and unknowable liabilities when they walk into litigation

1454390 essentially you represent the judge and the court as an independent in evaluating technological disputes and electronic discovery issues
1454391 for a narrow dispute such as a privilege review or a broader task like supervising all discovery
1454392 the level of technical detail simply outgrew what judges and counsel could comprehend
1454393 when neither the attorneys nor the court felt able to ask the right questions or understand the answers that created the need for a technical special master
1454394 i couldnt do what i do without both extensive trial experience and the training and background that qualifies me as a certified computer forensic examiner
1454395 sometimes i am a neutral examiner who sees both sides secret and privileged data to ensure that each side is getting what it is entitled to receive without compromising their opponents legitimate privacy and privilege issues
1454396 i may be a neutral expert advising the court when other experts cant seem to find common ground
1454397 the demand for the service outstrips the ranks of experienced technically adept lawyers
1454398 i made more as a trial lawyer but enjoyed it less

1454412 in addition to the two projects we have plans with desperado for a couple of original graphic novels bring the sold out requiem for the world graphic novel from image comics back in print a special project featuring original deadworld artist vincent locke and were looking at a way of presenting the original deadworld series which has been out of print for over a decade
1454413 deadworld has branched out into some areas such as licensed t shirts masks and the cd rom that collects the first 46 issues
1454414 and we hope to announce soon details regarding the movie option but id rather wait until we had more details
1454415 deadworld has always been more about the people and how they interact rather than a simple zombie chase and this story allows me to use my science background reed teaches college biology to explore things in this direction but i always thought it should have a certain art style and when sami was available i knew the time was right
1454416 when joe pruett desperado publishing asked me if i was interested to do a deadworld story arc i was like yes very interested i have been a big fan of romeros zombie movies a long long time and soon as i started to really study realistic illustration style it was always like some day im going to do a comic that includes the dead walking all i did was drawing zombies for couple of years and then some more so for me this is one dream come true my approach for the illustration style will be darker when compared to blue my last comic project this is a post apocalyptic world with nearly no hope in sight so it just has to be the script gary has written is a challenging and yet fun to draw there is a lot cool stuff to do gas masks laboratories piles of bodies and of course the zombies
1454417 its a nice variety of stories set in deadworld but not in the continuity of the series itself
1454418 ill be signing about 3000 copies i hope this doesnt affect my pitching arm because im planning to throw with heat from the mound then again when i see all the people in the stadium i will probably just pitch a few yards away from home plate ive been told they will boo if i throw a bad pitch
1454419 proportionally if you look at the number of jews in this country and in the world im associated with a hugely disproportionate number
1454420 the last two centuries have seen a tremendous decrease in the religiosity of most jews for a variety of reasons but what is difficult for outsiders to comprehend is the fact that even non religious jews still carry a four thousand year old religious tradition within their souls some claim its a genetic inheritance others might call it a form of a jungian collective id we call it osmosis for millennia the torah its stories and its values were taught intensively to every jew from childhood to old age as jews abandoned the active study of judaism in the last two centuries they still grew up in a society permeated with a knowledge of torah and its unique view of the world even a jew born in the baby boom after world war ii who cant remember any relatives who studied torah every day and lived by its commandments still has something very real in common with all other jews its a particular sense of right and wrong a unique ordering of priorities and a way of doing things that hearkens back to founding fathers like moses and abraham and founding mothers like leah and rachel
1454421 go to the ant you sluggard consider its ways and be wise it has no commander no overseer or ruler yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest how long will you lie there you sluggard when will you get up from your sleep a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man

1454427 to me i mean i would be bored to death in a nice suburb and also i am a cheap frugal s o b and this is where the affordable houses are
1454428 we must have talked for about five to ten minutes and he was like ready to hug me
1454429 one thing we experienced in the spring is when john bought that house we just kind of fed off of his enthusiasm
1454430 id blog about it and the next thing you know ive got the commander saying i want to know which cop said that to you i want his description this is a common everyday experience but you put it on the internet where the story is accessible to the world and it changes everything
1454431 people didnt remember what their heritage was unless they sat around a campfire listening to the old sage that had the beard
1454432 the internet is the flicking campfire around which we sit
1454433 and if people dont tell their story if people arent communicating you will have no progress thats what we have here we have progress

1454442 in essence it was a truncation error in the final printout
1454443 the problem was identified and it was fixed the error did not change the outcome
1454444 the next five months will be filled with lots of surprises
1454445 this is how we always envisioned episodic gaming monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the homestar creators chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality

1454457 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1454458 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1454459 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1454460 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1454461 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1454462 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1454463 theres a pent up demand from people on the right side of the aisle who feel that the mainstream media is effusively covering barack obama and not critically covering him
1454464 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1454465 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate

1454467 with book like these the minute some people know theyre out there they must have them
1454468 the anti obama readership is largely one that has already made up its mind and is looking for validation while the obama readership comprises both those who have already made up their minds and those who are curious about him
1454469 mccain doesnt have the same kind of resonance its nothing in comparison because you can still shape peoples view of obama but its way too late to shape their view of mccain
1454470 gets people excited about the idea of reading a book
1454471 books from both the left and the right often work this way

1454477 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
1454478 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1454479 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services
1454480 and learn we will the vision of mobileme is both exciting and ambitious and we will press on to make it a service we are all proud of by the end of this year

1454506 there is no justification theological spiritual or biblical for the existence of a plurality of churches genuinely separated in this way and mutually excluding one another internally and therefore externally every division as such is a deep riddle a scandal

1454695 while in beijing recently i was told about other terrorist plots or suspicious preparations that had been uncovered by the police the chinese however have provided very little public information about these episodes so details remain murky that leads to scepticism
1454696 the principal group is the east turkestan islamic movement in late july us intelligence intercepted a video message from the self proclaimed leader of the turkestan islamic party claiming responsibility for some recent bus explosions

1454704 what those signers are saying is that while they believe the doctrine of justification as articulated by the reformers is true they are not willing to say people must believe it to be saved in other words they believe people are saved who do not believe the biblical doctrine of justification
1454705 a lot of our students worry about typical evangelical attitudes toward people who have different belief systems and lifestyles its not that they dont take the bibles teachings seriously its just that they have gotten to know muslims and gays and they are embarrassed by the harsh spirit toward such folks that they see in the older generation if we dont do something about this negative image soon we could easily lose them for the evangelical cause

1454724 and he called his disciples to surrender themselves to him in self denial so they could follow him mark 8 34 38

1454860 okay so when youre attracted to a guy what do you do you check him out from all angles inside and out to see if hes someone worth spending time with you do the same with a book you hold it in your hands caressing it studying the front cover checking out the back pausing to read the synopsis blurbs from other authors and reviewers about the book all of it meant to draw you to the book to encourage you to take the book home with you just like a mans flirting and courtship is done in hopes that youre going to take him home with you eventually you flip open the book glance at the type and size of font used in the book maybe if youre like me and touch is very important so you rub your finger tips along the paper to feel the quality of the paper youre getting to know your book like you would a lover before taking him into your body

1454995 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time

1454999 listening to the people at u s soccer expectations are high
1455000 you bring in a brian mcbride youve got jozy altidore youve got freddy adu youve got michael bradley youve got goalkeeper brad guzan youve got michael parkhurst so you say to yourself expectations are high
1455001 youve got guys who can go forward guys who can put the ball in the back of the net
1455002 to me you look at it defensively i look at the roster of the last two games and its been parkhurst and maurice edu in the middle edu is not a center back hes always played midfield so defensively could be more of a concern i think they can score goals but i think its how does edu fit in at center back along with parkhurst does he step in does parkhurst sweep i think if you look at the roster thats more of a question mark
1455003 theres a lot a lot of good teams i think its going to come down to which three over age players have the most effect on the field
1455004 i mean argentina without lionel messi is that the same team you bring them in to make an impact you bring in a juan roman riquelme thats an impact you bring in ronaldinho for brazil thats a huge impact youve got a former world player of the year
1455005 the women have the pressure of having to get the gold medal because theyve won it already they have to defend it
1455006 theyve always done well in these big tournaments so i think now its how do they play it and how do they respond without their big star abby wambach on the field thats what people want to see
1455007 are they capable of getting a medal yes they are but again its a tournament you need a bit of luck you need some results to go your way and you need to stay healthy

1455027 faster more reliable better handling better braking more efficient and cheaper to buy
1455028 the basic design of a harley has remained pretty much the same for over 50 years
1455029 or push the envelope in terms of design or technology
1455030 in the interest of full disclosure its worth noting that ive done some work for american iron magazine including editing its h d 95th anniversary special and writing most of that publications content
1455031 ill begin by recounting two events that occurred this weekend during a mini vacation with my wife and two other couples in cooperstown new york the first took place during a stroll down that villages baseball obsessed downtown area we heard in the distance what sounded like the whine of ten thousand angry sewing machines the sound quickly got much louder rising to a needle in the eyeball crescendo as a single crotch rocket flew by it was quite possibly the loudest most annoying sound ive ever experienced the rider was bedecked in the official uniform of the young squid from top to bottom he wore a full faced helmet tank top shorts and flip flops
1455032 stock harleys must meet federal noise standards and are surprisingly quiet none was annoyingly loud
1455033 half a block beyond where we sat the harleys stopped for a red light they like every harley ive encountered had no problem sitting at idle perhaps thats because the 1930s technology rob mentions hasnt been used since well the 1930s of course all of the 1930s harleys ive been close to perhaps a dozen over the years have been able to idle as well
1455034 in a similar vein some people think that bmw owners drive like ego maniacal dickheads but that doesnt make bmws bad cars
1455035 which brings us at last to the crux of the matter the harley davidson motorcycle here rob has made the classic mistake of confusing form for function yes harleys look very much as they did 50 or in one case 80 years ago that is in a nutshell what accounts for whatever success the company has enjoyed over the last quarter century but the underlying technology has been replaced then upgraded and then replaced again to the point where all of the issues rob mentions have been satisfactorily addressed lets have a look at those issues
1455036 not particularly fast well maybe not but certainly fast enough my most recent harley was a very lightly modified top of the line flhtcu touring model or in harley shorthand ultra the heaviest bike in the company makes two up with two weeks worth of luggage for two stuffed into and on top of its luggage it had enough power to out accelerate the average sedan and to cruise all day long at 85 mph and remember mine was the slowest harley money could buy
1455037 nor do they handle or brake exceptionally well harley builds motorcycles on several platforms each of which has a different design brief if canyon carving at high speeds is on the agenda harley sells some splendid canyon carvers those harleys arent in the ninja class in that regard but they compensate by being good all around motorcycles rather than one trick ponies
1455038 in the interest of full disclosure its worth noting that ive done some work for american iron magazine including editing its h d 95th anniversary special and writing most of that publications content
1455039 i have a strong aversion to the japanese superbike crowd also they tend to drive recklessly not enthusiastically take stupid risks look like a choch and the bikes are pretty loud however in terms of pure ear splitting decibels they dont hold a candle to a harley flying down a street surrounded by buildings with its unique potato potato potato bouncing down the street for blocks its absolutely insane and completely without any penalties whatsoever as an automotive enthusiast i like cars tuned for actual performance instead of just looking tough and making a lot of noise and i know for a fact that many owners of sport compact cars have been harassed and ticketed by cops who feel their exhaust is too loud they write these tickets even if the exhaust is completely stock while ignoring the thousands of modified harley davidsons blaring their existence to the world and as an enthusiast i feel the difference between a harley and crotch rocket is quite vast if they were cars the harley would be a 1980s honda civic all modded out with a fiberglass body kit huge wing neon lights flashy rims and a gigantic exhaust system of course it wouldnt be at all fast but it would look mean and sound really loud and annoying just like a harley the super bike would be more along the lines of a subaru sti with a rock hard suspension that punishes you for driving long distances still really loud but with actual performance to back it up
1455040 i feel that motorcycles today have really lost what makes a bike a bike
1455041 indeed how many stay that way how many ever receive tickets for having an obnoxiously loud exhaust system i havent seen any
1455042 i find it hard to believe that as quite an experienced harley rider you rarely encounter one with idling problems i see it a lot and i try to avoid them as much as possible
1455043 a 3 series is a good car but id never own one purely for that reason i dont want to be grouped as that guy ive experienced too many bmw owners with attitude problems for me to enjoy almost any of them excluding the 850csi
1455044 which brings us at last to the crux of the matter the harley davidson motorcycle here rob has made the classic mistake of confusing form for function
1455045 then why do they vibrate so much why do they make so little power out of such massive engines why do i see puddles under so many of them why do i see so many of them broken down just last night on my way from chicago to milwaukee i saw three of them stranded on the side of the road i saw zero other kinds of bikes
1455046 well maybe not but certainly fast enough my most recent harley was a very lightly modified top of the line flhtcu touring model or in harley shorthand ultra the heaviest bike in the company makes two up with two weeks worth of luggage for two stuffed into and on top of its luggage it had enough power to out accelerate the average sedan and to cruise all day long at 85mph and remember mine was the slowest harley money could buy
1455047 true but almost any bike will be faster than most cars on the road but in the bike world harleys are relatively slow
1455048 most of what rob doesnt like about harleys has nothing to do with the motorcycles
1455049 after enriching the air fuel mixture and installing a hotter cam i found the stock exhaust to be too restrictive
1455050 i find it hard to believe that as quite an experienced harley rider you rarely encounter one with idling problems i see it a lot and i try to avoid them as much as possible
1455051 indeed how many stay that way how many ever receive tickets for having an obnoxiously loud exhaust system
1455052 it had enough power to out accelerate the average sedan
1455053 my own take is that i know who i am and if others choose to judge me by my wheels
1455054 why do they make so little power out of such massive engines
1455055 i feel that motorcycles today have really lost what makes a bike a bike
1455056 chris honda civics with a fart cannon and bodykit look and sound mean
1455057 david being obsessed with cruisers associated this comment with a cb750 which isnt what i was writing about i meant the cb series specifically 125s 175s 250s etc theyre just motorcycles not cruisers not sportbikes
1455058 my only real problems with the harley riders ive encountered on the roads is poor riding skills never heard of
1455059 there are three kinds of motorcyclists 1 those that ride in a reasonable manner most people dont even notice 2 those that ride like a jackass passing between lanes and going through every slim opening they see 3 those that have made their bike loud as so as you can clearly see two thirds of bikers are obnoxious and the other third goes unnoticed so you could probably say that all bikers are obnoxious
1455060 hopefully that script will come together and well be able to do that in the next two years or so
1455061 ill be the dead father ill show up in some spiritual scenes and give him some guidance well find some young guy that is capable of doing all those things and make it really cool
1455062 you know when i look at him i see andre 3000

1455064 at the time my husband was a chemo patient for 11 years the walls of the hospital were bare and unpainted the environment was so dingy for patients undergoing such a demoralizing procedure i wanted to brighten it up patients and nurses told me they loved seeing the art
1455065 we did have a few fights what we would call assault with a deadly weapon
1455066 i remember that investigation went into the wee hours of the morning
1455067 we like police work but we also like seeing people enjoy themselves and remain safe
1455068 ill tell ya every once in a while when we get a quiet one its appreciated
1455069 the offensive materials directly contradict the values that my parents taught me and are forbidden in my parents home my facebook page is my sole responsibility
1455070 it is clear that my actions were juvenile disrespectful and a mistake on my part
1455071 i plan to walk right into those factories and living quarters to see for myself what conditions exist
1455072 there were some examples of problems that we found and we raised those with the equivalent of the attorney general

1455082 no use pretending its not art house its not even authored in a way its a big massive brand a bbc brand the most important show
1455083 the interesting question is where to place it for that family audience
1455084 it does moderately well for the sci fi channel but it transmits for a 9 p m slot which it isnt written or made for
1455085 you know what were pleased with the way its been performing for us
1455086 de tot nu toe gepresenteerde resultaten buiten de financi le sector zijn niet zo slecht als aanvankelijk werd gedacht een net iets beter dan verwacht cijferseizoen steunt het sentiment
1455087 ik denk dat wij hier weg zullen moeten we zijn hier uitgeboerd dat is jammer dat de gemeente zon mall wil binnenhalen zal economisch wel noodzakelijk zijn maar ik weet niet of het een succes wordt in landen als canada moet je tweehonderd kilometer rijden voor een winkelcentrum daar heeft zoiets zin hier is het vermoedelijk toch veelal kijken en niks kopen
1455088 ik denk dat het voor consumenten heel erg leuk is het wordt een hoogwaardig gebied weer eens iets anders dan de pc hooftstraat in amsterdam die altijd wordt genoemd het betekent ook een sociaal economische impuls voor brabant als geheel we hebben het hier over een investering van vierhonderd miljoen euro die twee drieduizend banen oplevert
1455089 we hadden de andere steden gevraagd omdat we voor dit onderzoek zo transparant mogelijk wilden opereren
1455090 in andere steden is jarenlang alles min of meer vanzelf gegaan breda en den bosch hebben aantrekkelijke historische binnensteden eindhoven heeft bedrijven zoals philips die veel investeringen hebben aangetrokken tilburg heeft vanaf de jaren zeventig alles op eigen kracht moeten doen als dan nu een projectontwikkelaar bij ons aanklopt dan moeten die andere steden niet ineens zon smalle defensieve houding aannemen laten we blij zijn dat de markt voor brabant kiest in plaats van de boel alleen maar te willen vertragen
1455091 zullen moeten worden afgewogen tegen de voor en nadelen van profielverandering en mogelijke inkrimping van bestaande centra
1455092 bedrijven en merken hebben behoefte aan veel grotere winkels dan ze in de binnensteden kunnen krijgen die grote winkels moet je in een historische binnenstad ook niet willen met al zn aardige steegjes en hoekjes en gezellige kroegjes

1455138 we take great pride in this we have ownership were not ignoring that
1455139 the best way for us to remedy this is to do right from here on in
1455140 i think the stakes get higher every year you play football and we all feel that
1455141 you have to improve as a program or somebody isnt going to be here the next year

1455152 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1455153 i nflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1455154 expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1455155 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1455156 oi aqui o jos do blog podcast do jos e voc est ouvindo o podcast decodificando
1455157 i wake up go to work come home get a little high and watch tv then i go to sleep and sometimes i go out and party at the bar with friends on weekends
1455158 they all say even the young man who was in the wrestling match that its part of the show i dont know if i agree with that ive got mixed feelings
1455159 if you got s you would like to talk about of the mike levy deal then talk about it here i dont want a separate thread started for just that stuff that people are saying happened but did not happen just like was already on the thread if you want the real story buy the dvd the kid got an ass whipping for what i and many others feel was all the right reasons he did not go to the hospital as a matter of fact he came back after getting cleaned up to watch the rest of the show he was told he would be brought back and was grateful for that so i guess he could not be too bad off i promise his face does not look anywhere near as bad as mickies does these morning the kid was not beat up as people are putting it if he was beat up by the wrestlers who were out there he be lying in a hospital bed right now end of story
1455160 are you kidding me texting while driving while i am in the car i am telling mom

1455163 i hate it when i order a tofu sandwich somewhere and it pretty much just tastes like or actually is blocks of watery plain tofu stuffed between two pieces of bread whats up with that you might as well be eating a wet mushy sponge i love me some tofu but you got to treat it right you know
1455164 so i was thinking about tofu and imagining thin slices of flavorful goodness to stuff into sandwiches
1455165 die ersten quests sind nichts au ergew hnliches nach einem scharm tzel zwischen forsaken und allianz soll ich die briggebliebenen leichen verbrennen das arthas keine neuen diener daraus erschaffen kann
1455166 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1455167 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1455168 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1455169 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1455170 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1455171 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1455172 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1455173 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1455174 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world

1455331 conclusionwhile i understand that there is a lot of click fraud going on and realise that google needs a way to fight it this study case clearly shows that innocent are much more likely to be hurt because there is justice system in place google plays god here sorry we cant tell you why you are guilty and we dont need to prove it to you good bye its darn easy to bring someones adsense account to a closure by google just arrange a surge of clicks on someones site youve already heard of botnets right and youve heard of people cracking captchas by making other people do the typing right and probably 10 000 other ways its probably much harder to make a dent in bigger sites with a lot of traffic so smaller sites are much more vulnerable since its much easier to create a burst of clicks and get it on the google fraud team radar im wondering about the following google prohibits the publishers to click ads on their own sites but thats silly what if i see an ad that im genuinely interested in its so easy to forget about that prohibition and click on the ad and boom you get banned or your co worker sitting on the same ip clicks some ads how could he know about the prohibition im not talking about going all day around and click on your sites ads im talking about clicking a few of them here and there it wont make the publisher more than a few dozens of cents why google adsense cant just not account for those few clicks rather than count them as a fraud simply change the contract to say any clicks coming from your ip will not be accounted as a revenue thatd certainly help a lot of people both the publishers and the google adsense team another problem is that when google disables your account you lose all your earnings so far even those that have happened before the illegal activity which hopefully wasnt done by you which was the case with me i e if my account wouldnt have been re enabled those 100 dollars would have been lost also after notifying me that the account is disabled google has continued serving ads on my site until ive removed their javascript code after i realised that the appeal was just their way to show that they listen i wonder who was getting paid for those clicks generated during that period if they have considered the site to be illegally generating clicks were the advertisers burning their money for nothing so the next time you get excited by all those books and sites touting google ads as your greatest source of revenue think twice before you waste your time and energy on something that is not under your control and can be taken away by a malicious user in co operation with google adsense team google adsense is undeniably a great tool when it works but id definitely love to have a better control over it

1455336 the arbys brand stands for high quality products which has resulted in higher check average relative to our competitors
1455337 during the second quarter we did not waiver from this long established cut above brand positioning and results were negatively impacted by the effect of aggressive competitor discounting looking ahead we believe continued competitor discounting at the current level is unsustainable given rising commodity costs and increasing profitability pressure on operators we are already seeing reports of competitors re evaluating the prices of their value menus
1455338 longer term we believe arbys will remain well positioned to deliver superior results due to our unique brand attributes loyal customers supportive franchisee base and strong operations centric business model

1455379 there were no reported ejections or arrests made as a result of the event
1455380 this appeared to be successful in moving individuals away from the local nightclubs during the bar flush there were a few infractions over the course of the weekend however we are pleased with the overall turnaround and the cooperation of those drivers
1455381 this individual became irate and threatened hotel staff while demanding cash back officers located the suspect in the parking lot and when they attempted to arrest him he became combative and attempted to swallow several baggies believed to contain cocaine during the arrest the suspect attempted to bite an officer twice
1455382 extending terms to four years might suit some communities but im not sure it would suit kelowna kelowna is a changing community going through lots of development the demand for infrastructure is never ending
1455383 i believe a three year term is a good balance it gives us the best of both worlds
1455384 having been a new councillor last year knowing it takes a year to really get up to speed my personal opinion is that a four year term makes more sense there is just so much to learn in the first year then there is just about one year to do the work and then in the third year its like election fever kicks in and everyone goes into election mode
1455385 im happy with whatever is decided its certainly a good topic to discuss there is a financial benefit for a community to have elections every four years instead of three but thats also longer for people to commit their time
1455386 its being totally rebuilt the reason its brown now is because were not irrigating it

1455395 a lot of democrats if you try to get them to say i want there to be fewer abortions their mouths just wont move
1455396 because of my long standing opposition to partial birth abortion in 2002 i proposed an amendment that would have made this ban constitutional unfortunately partisan politics got in the way and the amendment was rejected by the general assembly
1455397 the second thing that democrats have to do better on is not attacking the religious right
1455398 i think that has been a standard bogeyman that democrats have often used in campaigns including campaigns in virginia if somebody advances an idea or position thats wrong then attack them for having a bad idea but they are not wrong because they are religious
1455399 when democrats kind of cavalierly attack the religious right or go after pat robertson or jerry falwell our candidates have sent the signal to a lot of religious people well i guess they are not interested in me and i think this includes a lot of people who would fit very naturally within the democratic party
1455400 i think the most important thing from my perspective is somebody who can help me govern
1455401 i want somebody who im compatible with who i can work with who has a shared vision who certainly complements me in the sense that they provide a knowledge base or an area of expertise that can be useful because were going to have a lot of problems and a lot of work to do
1455402 im not interested in a vice president who i just send off to go to funerals

1455407 now one of my opponents wanted to set a date for withdrawal that would have meant disaster
1455408 if we surrender and wave a white flag like senator clinton wants to do and withdraw as governor romney wanted to do then there will be chaos genocide and the cost of american blood and treasure would be dramatically higher
1455409 he said its a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground
1455410 i think its a pretty good timetable as we should or horizons for withdrawal but they have to be based on conditions on the ground this success is very fragile its incredibly impressive but very fragile so we know those of us who have been involved in it for many years know that if we reverse this by setting a date for withdrawal all of the hard won victory can be reversed

1455485 just like most courses in the area there are some beautiful views you can see mount baker from the course but we do have the views of the two bays fidalgo and similk
1455486 being located between the two bays its rare when we dont have any winds
1455487 its not that the winds always howl but it plays different on different days when the wind is coming out of the north the course plays different than it does with the predominantly south winds the wind rarely blows real hard but it makes you think about which direction it is blowing from every day
1455488 its a 406 yard par 4 the second shot is across water to a relatively small green with two sand traps at the back of green and one grass bunker in front there is a great view of mount baker from the hole it actually probably is one of the toughest holes on the course because of the water and the sand and the length its the no 1 handicap hole along with being our signature hole its also one our toughest
1455489 its a short part par 4 just 300 yards but its got a large oak tree that sits right in front of the green a real small postage stamp green you can make anywhere from a 2 to a 6 on it
1455490 adding something to the water and length and sand when the wind is blowing out of the south the relatively small green is hard to hold a lot of times you go into the back bunkers when the wind is out of the south it can be anywhere from a mid to short iron in for good players when the wind is coming the other way it can be a mid to long iron either way its harder when the wind is at your back to hold the green
1455491 a 246 yard par 4 at a number of courses it would be a par 3 for a strong player reaching the green in one shot is a possibility its got an elevated tee and elevated green to reach the green is a full carry of 240 yards its a real fun unique hole that doesnt seem too difficult i cant think of another hole in the area like it but it is our most often birdied hole
1455492 its a 526 par 5 it is pretty wide open off an elevated tee tee sits about 30 feet above the fairway with a great view of similk bay it really is a grip it and rip it hole
1455493 the hole runs downhill and the first 20 feet of the green follow the downhill terrain then even though the terrain continues downhill the green starts to work its way up a mound it can make putts break different than you would think without a doubt its the most difficult green to read
1455494 its only 300 yards on the scorecard but its got a pot bunker in front of the green its a two tiered green that drops off in back its a drivable green for strong players but you can stand on the tee thinking 3 and often walk away with a 5 or 6
1455495 if youre a long hitter you usually want to hit your tee shot down the middle and you may think you hit a great shot but if want to go for the green in two you want to favor the left side of the fairway if you hit it to the center or right its going to be real difficult to reach in two you can hit a good shot and you may think its where you want to be but you may still have some work cut out for you if you hit it toward the center or to the right youre going to have to hit it over some water to reach the green
1455496 its a 505 yard par 5 after a good tee shot you can play a second shot that can reach the green or at least give you a shot at the green but there is a bunker in front of the green and water left if youre not careful you could be making a big number or you could give yourself a shot at eagle
1455497 weve got some long holes and some short holes youve got to pay attention to what you are doing on this course
1455498 a par 4 water all down the left side of the hole the water hazard makes it a unique hole it also cuts in front of the green
1455499 its a short par 4 you need to carry the water with your tee shot and if you do youve got a chip and a putt most guys like it because they can birdie it with a good drive
1455500 the fifth hole is a par 5 the road is down the left side all the way the green is a tricky putting green its a very difficult green to get a good read by far its the longest hole on the course at 478 yards
1455501 right after the par 5 it is a par 3 126 yards from the whites and there is no water or anything to really worry about
1455502 because of the green because its a short par 5 it can jump up and bite you
1455503 the length you have to worry about the road it can really be trouble but if you can drive it good off the tee you will be in pretty good shape
1455504 that green is sloping just like no 5 its got quite a bit of slope towards the lake just like no 5 does maybe more than you realize
1455505 you can drive the green but you can also put it in the water hazard
1455506 hit it long on no 8 and you are in trouble if you drift towards the back of the green its sloping away from you its an impossible shot if you hit it too long
1455507 when they closed the course down in 2004 it was turned into a hayfield
1455508 my vision is that this is definitely family friendly golf
1455509 we hope to get a lot of junior and younger players who find it difficult to go to a big 18 hole course when they are only hitting the ball 50 or 75 yards it makes it difficult and frustrating for them to pick up the game here golfers will get to learn while they play a challenging course that is kept in excellent condition
1455510 i think this course is a nice addition to homestead
1455511 well have the mean 18 hole course and the nice nine hole golf course i think it will be a friendlier version of golf for most players even though there are still plenty of challenges out there
1455512 it presently is a converted par 3 when its fully functional i think its going to be the hole its your classic risk reward short par 4 from the back tees it plays 324 but the problem is the lake takes you to 290 it really is a hole for the most part that every player is going to have to maneuver a mid to long iron off the tee then the key is the approach shot to an extremely narrow kidney shaped green
1455513 it has an elevation of probably 50 feet from tee to green its about 130 yards its a visually interesting hole you get to see the entire green there are a couple of tee placements that are pretty devious i definitely wouldnt say its the easiest hole on course because it can definitely be difficult depending on where the pin is located
1455514 from the back tees its probably the most difficult the tee shot is blind up over a little roll then drops back down to the green its fairly tight it doesnt have as much water as the no 9 but it is very tight its like hitting out of a chute you pretty much have to pipe it or you never know whats going to happen on that hole
1455515 it plays at about 100 yards the green is one of the largest on the course and theres not a tremendous amount of slope to it its 100 yards which is everyones favorite distance the bunkers are in play but really dont factor into it much i would say everyone should find it pretty easy
1455516 its one of those holes when you walk up its right in front of you the green is fairly simple one bunker is right behind it but even if you cant feel it that offshore breeze can play tricks with you it seems like a nice casual staring hole but before you know it youre putting for a bogey
1455517 if you have ability to hit is 285 plus in the air no
1455518 even though its not an option for most players if youre playing from the white tees then the carry drops down another 15 yards to about 265 and thats doable by some long hitters who are middle handicappers its really the only opportunity to challenge the hole
1455519 dont underestimate the golf course the length of the course give an impression that its easy but the par 3s are challenging club selection is important the bunkers and the water are there to get you if you arent focused
1455520 balls will be bouncing on this course during the winter which you dont typically get at a lot of other courses in the area
1455521 but i dont think anyone wants to be outside in that kind of weather
1455522 a lot of people dont have five hours to play a round they can come out here and play nine and then go home and do the chores that your wife asked you to do
1455523 short par 3 135 yards it has a lot of trouble one being the sand bunker in the middle of the green its kind of a la riviera on the pga tour it creates some problems for the errant shot if you end up on one side or the other you can easily three putt resulting in a bogey
1455524 pretty straight away par 4 and it heads right toward mount baker so you get a very scenic view as you play the hole the fairway is pretty narrow with sand bunkers down the left with ob out of bounds right and left and a pond in front of the green
1455525 the average golfer will come away with a bogey or worse its a par 3 with 180 yards usually into the wind ob left water right and a very deep sand bunker in front of the green that bunker has ruined a lot of good rounds and clubs if you know what i mean my suggestion is to use enough club to get to the back of the green to take the trouble out of play
1455526 not a lot of trouble fairly generous fairway a good drive will set you up with a relatively easy sand wedge to the green birdie here is the score but a par will never hurt
1455527 a par 4 usually playing downwind with a large open fairway not a lot of trouble theres ob right and left but not a lot to worry about if you let the shaft out youll have a pretty good approach shot
1455528 it has a lot undulation not a flat spot on this green its possible to have a three way break if youre not careful the golfers like to blame me because i set the pin but its just not flat anywhere
1455529 every hole out here has sand traps in fact there are 34 traps total on the course the average golfer panics when theyre in the sand mainly because they dont have time to practice that part of the game
1455530 use the driver there and take the water out of play down the left side and hit it to the mouth of the green its a shorter par 4 it will leave you with a short approach or possibly even a putt but if you do use the driver and you slice you will have to use the drop area because the water is to the right there
1455531 we have a lot of people who come out here to play such as the whatcom seniors who play every course
1455532 the always come here and think they can whip the course and they dont this course is challenging every bit of it
1455533 were pretty close to lake padden golf course and dakota creek golf and country club in terms of our prices
1455534 a lot of people associated lower value with lower greens fees they think this will be a less challenging course but thats is not the case
1455535 par 3 yardage is 151 from the whites its over a pond and has a big green just a gorgeous hole one of those picturesque holes a lot of people like that
1455536 par 3 most challenging because its 216 yards they like the challenge of that one on the white tees the green is banked up so if you dont get on its tough to get the second shot near the pin its a tough hole to get a par
1455537 516 yards on the white tees there are some ponds on this hole its narrow driving off the tee to begin with placement of the second shot is important you want to be on the left side otherwise you have to go over a big tree to the green plus there is a sand trap on the right side its a little more of target golf
1455538 it is ranked as the easiest because from the whites its 267 yards its an easy one to get a birdie for the big long hitters they can get on the green or right near it and have a chance to go for eagle
1455539 its the smallest green and built on a hill in essence its the hardest because it is so small
1455540 its target golf once again your tee shot has to be good one or you have to lay up for the creek third shot has to be placed down the middle because if you get on either side of the green its very hard to chip on from the whites its 492 yards
1455541 350 yards its somewhat wide open except for trees on the right side your second shot has a nice sized green there so you can shoot in for a birdie
1455542 its right along the trees and theres a lot of long grass and a creek runs that through there a lot of people like to get it close to that side because it shortens the hole a bit but if you go too far left youre in trouble
1455543 we have some more ponds and water hazards but not as much undulation this area started out as farmland so this was the perfect setting for a links style course
1455544 its a great hole and its located on a great spot on the course its the ultimate risk reward finish you can find yourself in position whether you are going to go for this island green in two shots it can really make or break your round its just a cool finish if somebody wants to come out and play one nine front or back they always want to play the back nine so can play no 18
1455545 it has to be no 4 or no 18 theyre both good fair holes and plenty of fun no 4 is a hole you cant rip it off the tee its a hole you need to lay up on about 170 to 175 yards out then you have another shot over a little creek the green divided into three sections because a grass bunker in the middle of approach to the green it is sort of a long narrow kidney shaped green
1455546 it really depends on the wind if the wind is blowing out the northeast no 1 is the toughest its a good tough long starting par 4 if its playing into the wind it gets even tougher the second shot is really difficult to get the right distance on the second shot you really have a hard time getting enough club to hit into the wind
1455547 its a nice short par 3 with out a whole lot of trouble anywhere the pin is placed its from a pitching wedge to 7 iron for most people the toughest pin placement is in the back right but you can play to any part of the green and have a decent chance of making par on this hole
1455548 its the only hole where a long driver of the ball will find absolutely no trouble it has a huge wide fairway its a par 4 you can stand up there and pound it out there usually the wind is helping a little bit so you can really hit it long
1455549 the yardage isnt bad its a dogleg par 4 but people make it longer than it needs to be because they bail out to the right now there are some trees in the bailout area that can play tricks on you they were planted five or six years ago and now theyre getting big enough to cause some problems the green is not terribly hard but there are some undulations that can make it difficult
1455550 there is about a six foot face or lip on that thing if you get up against that lip you literally cannot play over it you have to play out to the side and that is tough for people to see its not something they want to do but that lip will knock any shot back down
1455551 its got to be the second shot is always good if you hit your ball up there in that go for two range you have to think about it that can make for a three or four shot difference in your final total depending how you pull off that shot
1455552 you can miss it right on every hole except nos 4 and 5 every tee shot except 4 and 5 can you can miss it right but youre still going to be in play now im not saying youre going to be in good shape but there are few hazards and almost no out of bounds to the right almost all of our ob is on the left
1455553 i just suppose i started to want to do it when i was a college golfer i wanted to get in business aspect of golf and continue to compete at the same time
1455554 its a very large course and the topography or lay of the land is amazing there are a lot of ups and downs to this course
1455555 it makes it a challenge to hit the ball clean because of the lay of the land
1455556 youre not always going to hit it flush it is playable if you understand the challenge its definitely a golf course you need to play a few times do that and youll understand
1455557 it is a par 4 380 yards with an elevated tee down to a huge fairway then right behind the 18th green is mount baker visually it is probably one of the prettiest holes in the state its pretty cool
1455558 its a 380 yard dogleg left and the fairway slopes right to left and then the green sits down in a bowl its kind of like an amphitheater the setting of the green is perfect for the shape of the hole
1455559 424 yards it plays downhill with a slight dogleg to the left but the fairway slopes from left to right and the wind comes from left to right fitting your tee shot into the fairway is tough and the green has sort of an island green effect all around the green is a wetland its a dry wetland but if your ball goes in there it is a lost shot it really almost plays like an island green
1455560 par 5 505 yards dogleg right with a large fairway for your tee ball and a large fairway the second shot the green is fairly flat the opening hole is probably the friendliest
1455561 a well played tee shot allows you to take a shot at the green in two however youve still got two wetlands to get past the first one youll have to get across with tee ball if you dont want to risk it you can lay up in front and there is another wetland right in the front of the green its a great risk reward hole how do you feel
1455562 it is a par 5 516 yards with a very wide open fairway typically youll have the south wind with you it is a fun hole to let that tee ball fly and the fairway is really generous
1455563 its only 338 yards however you have to hit a good tee shot and you have to hit a good second shot its fairly short but you have got to hit two good shots to get your par
1455564 the truth is everyone tries to find movement in their putts and almost all the putts are straight it is just hard to read the 13th green
1455565 almost all are dry but they are waist high if a ball goes anywhere in the wetlands youre pretty much going to take a one shot penalty drop
1455566 its a big part of how we try to market the course
1455567 were really into the pay for 18 play all day slogan twenty seven holes is a perfect number of holes to play in a day thirty six is too much but here you can play 18 holes have a nice lunch and then go out and play nine more in the afternoon
1455568 we like to say the beauty is the biggest hazard out there
1455569 both par 5s on the west course are reachable in two
1455570 the challenge is keeping your ball in play if you do you certainly can score well on this course
1455571 the neat thing about it is you never play the same par two holes in a role
1455572 some places you go and get stretches of par 4s and that can get a little boring the north course is our most favored nine among our customers
1455573 it plays out toward the valley the green is situated on a plateau where you can look over the entire skagit valley its just a beautiful hole when they first staked the holes i knew that would be a special spot there
1455574 595 yard dogleg right par 5 a beautiful hole it has a huge 2 acre pond that fronts the green the pond runs 170 yards out all the way up to the green ninety percent of the players will lay up in front it makes it challenging to stay away from the pond
1455575 its a dogleg left par 4 that goes right through a grove of cedar trees when robert muir graves designed the course we didnt have a whole lot of evergreen trees when he came across the cedar trees he really wanted to keep them so he carved out a really narrow path through them its the only hole in all 27 that doesnt have a bunker but its still the most difficult
1455576 its a great risk reward hole a drivable par 4 with a big pond down the right obviously its a big risk to put it in the lake all the way along which doesnt work out to well but if you drive it out there you can easily make birdie
1455577 shortest par 3 on the course but it sits in a corner of property where the wind swirls it has a two tiered green with dramatic slope if you miss it on the right side its very difficult to chip or putt you see its a 137 yard par 3 and you think its going to be a piece of cake but its not its one of my favorite par 3s anywhere in the world
1455578 its got a wide landing area great payoff for gripping and ripping in that you can get a mid to long iron into green of a par 5 great reward for ripping it and there is a nice generous landing area
1455579 its a reachable par 4 but a great risk one that most of our members think is worth it its fun to get it up around the green i think its neat to have a reachable par 4 i love the risk reward aspect of it
1455580 interesting challenge on the south course with the greens being as undulating as they are all of us who play out here believe that there is a pull to sedro woolley we like to say that all putts break to sedro woolley theres not supposed to be grain in our greens but on the south course they do have a slope that is hard to see or some type of grain no 1 south appears to slope from back to front but in fact the balls tend to break toward the back of the green
1455581 your drop is going to leave you in a bad spot it will make it very difficult to recover for an up and down to make up for your penalty stroke
1455582 we want to make sure everyone feels really comfortable here
1455583 its a real low key atmosphere out here we play to the everyday golfer this is just s fun place to be
1455584 more people come up to me and say its the prettiest course theyve ever been on
1455585 there are no homes and you can see right up the georgia strait it is built out in the forest and you gets these spectacular views
1455586 we say its the best golf buy in the county it may not be the best course and it may not be the cheapest course but it is the best golf for your dollar in this area
1455587 it has the grand canyon shot its very intimidating hitting over the canyon it the canyon is only 80 yards but the fact that its there is very intimidating plus its very beautiful
1455588 par 4 but you have a shot at reaching the green he course superintendent james bowyer really likes the way it looks its flanked to the left by a big fir tree it makes it look really nice but we want to take it out because it causes a lot of trouble it came within two minutes of coming down once but his saw ran out of gas it the tree grows profusely because of all the watering of the green and the fertilizing of the green so it probably grows three times as much any fir in the northwest
1455589 its the toughest in the county a lot of people come in here and say it may be the toughest in state its a great way to start people off i wish it was a little further down the course its a par 5 and people always remember first day they par it woods on both sides right over the 150 yard marker is the salmon spawning green which adds to the difficulty then youre going uphill to the green and good luck
1455590 its wide open and has lots of forgiveness when youre going toward green youre overlooking the whole county and can see the san juan islands and on a clear day you can see into the georgia strait
1455591 its a 78 yard par 3 it looks like piece of cake i mean 78 yards your grandma can do it right but there are woods within 10 feet of the green just off the collar so not even 10 feet you have to be on target and hit that green
1455592 the right side of no 2 or shooting over the canyon on no 3 is a bad place on this particular course its really a thinking mans course the pros have told me if you can master this course you can play anywhere in the world because it has every lie youll find anywhere
1455593 its the newest green it was recently redone it looks flat as a pancake but has very subtle breakings in it when you reach it youve gone through 17 other greens with lots of undulation then this one looks as flat as a pancake but its not
1455594 lots of open spaces on both sides its a par 4 playing uphill to a gorgeous setting my favorite hole to look at in the evening its long and uphill so it plays even longer we keep our rough cut short so theres lots of forgiveness
1455595 it was the last hole we built because didnt know how we were going to do with it what we ended up with is a blind hole you cant see the green from the tee if you play it between the two fir trees that are straight ahead youll be fine its a love hate hole once you learn to play it you love it but before then you hate it we suggest using a 5 wood and give it all youve got but be straight
1455596 we have big old mature trees lining the fairways it creates a different look than what you will see on many of the younger courses in the area you dont seem too many younger courses that are build on land with mature trees like we have you need to look at courses that have some history like ours
1455597 you dont feel like you are seeing every other golfer on the course each hole you feel like you are out there by yourself its a peaceful enjoyable experience
1455598 to some it all about the controversial tree especially for the bigger hitters it lies right where you would like to start your drive its about 150 foot douglas fir probably a few hundred years old dave bocci our course superintendent has the right to remove any tree he sees fit except that one that one would take a vote by membership to get out of here for a long hitter that wants to reach green in two it lies right in your way
1455599 its a beautiful setting the tee is right below the balcony on the clubhouse so the pro shop and clubhouse are right on top of the first tee it looks down quite a long fairway it can create some first tee jitters its a fun hole a 485 yard par 5 that creates great opportunity for big hitters to have an iron into the green with a big drive it definitely gives them a chance to get a birdie right off the bat for the average golfer its relatively easy par
1455600 it puts lot of pressure to make 4 on no 1 because you know 5 is very likely on the second hole its a soft dogleg right that has a good uphill nature to it there is out of bounds to the right and the rough is heavy to the right and left if you get in the junk youre dead the green is severely contoured for a fairly decent sized green there are very few useable pin locations because it is so severely contoured you see so many three puts that it bring bogey back into the ballgame even if youve hit two perfect shots to get to the green
1455601 its the easiest hole to birdie its got a fairly wide fairway if you get a pretty good drive youve got 220 to the green so you can hit and iron big hitters can use a 5 or 6 iron to the green
1455602 i should have intestinal fortitude to go for the green
1455603 every day i start groups off from the first tee and i see every day i see somebody top it and end up in the water from the scratch golfer to the high handicapper you always have a crowd so youre going to have people watching you literally need to hit it 50 yards to clear that creek there are a lot bad places to hit it but to add insult to injury the most embarrassing place is the creek on no 1
1455604 i think on a scorecard you may say its no 18 because its a par 3 to some its an odd way to finish but i know several great golf courses end on a par 3 the fact that its 192 yards and you need to hit anywhere from a 3 to 5 iron into that hole it plays longer and more difficult than any of our par 4s
1455605 if you hit it long maybe you can get there in 2 and take a shot at a birdie it has a generous fairway the longer hitters can clear the fairway bunkers but if you miss it a little youll be in that fairway bunker its one hole that i focus on hitting it harder
1455606 its something that i picked up from longtime members and what told i told the class 2a boys before played the state championship out here a lot of people come in and we have hole location sheets that tell them exactly where hole is you dont need it if you play to the middle of green on our small greens youll never be in trouble youll never have a long shot
1455607 even on a bad day when youve it bad and put a big score everything about this place is just relaxing
1455608 the thing about this course is that any level of golfer is going to have a good time
1455609 the novice golfer is going to be blown away by the beauty its an open course and there are no houses around you can see some bald eagles and hawks its really beautiful plus you have the elevation changes on no 1 and 10 its just awesome to hit off those holes the good golfers are going to challenge their course management skills in ways other courses dont
1455610 its a par 3 175 yards up on a plateau its one of the holes that really frames mount baker nicely off the tee you look up and see mount baker with lines of trees on either side plus youve got to shape a pretty good shot off the tee you have to play a bit of a cut or a fade if you hit it long or left youre going to be in trouble youve got to play your shot to the front of the green
1455611 its the last hole and its a par 5 plus its a pretty good risk reward shot youve been playing all day and maybe your have a game going with your friends and its all coming down to that hole we hear a lot of stories of games won or lost on that hole plus its just a beautiful hole
1455612 you have got to use your course management skills with the tee shot there is a creek that cuts across the fairway so if you hit it left or right you will get wet for the long hitters its tough to get there in two ive done it once its not impossible but its definitely a challenge the green is elevated 80 feet or so so if you are 230 out it plays like its 250 or 260 if you are short it will roll all the way back down the hill or roll into a bunker you will see some birdies here but not many eagles even par is a good score on this hole
1455613 its not overly long you can hit a 3 wood or a driver off the tee to an ample landing area from the fairway you hit to a fairly good sized green usually you have a 9 iron or wedge in your hand and the green is very receptive to shots so the ball will hit and stay the hole just sets up real nice
1455614 its not the easiest shot but its the biggest challenge the hole is 540 yards from the back tees so if you hit a good drive off the tee it leaves you about a 3 wood to a long narrow green with trouble all around its a bit of a blind shot you cant see the green all that well so you have to pick something to aim for and trust yourself im a bit of a risk reward junkie so whenever i have a good tee shot i go for it
1455615 its a 315 yard par 4 on the scorecard but its one of those course management holes if you let your guard down on the tee shot you can find your approach to the green blocked off if you go to the right and you can lose your ball in the long grass if you go left the green is elevated so you still have work to do even if you hit a good tee shot the green drops off to the left and the back so it leaves you with probably the most intimidating wedge shots on the course on paper it looks like a no brainer but you have got to be careful
1455616 if you hit it into the water hazard or sand bunker you know what to expect but if you go in the long native grass around a lot of these holes first youve got to find it if you cant its a long walk back to hit another shot
1455617 it has a lot more slope from back to front than you think if youre above the hole its going to go a lot faster than you expect and if youre below it its going to be slower its a hard hole to get a good feel for the speed
1455618 the tee is elevated above the fairway 80 to 100 feet below there is an ample landing area so this is a chance to really hit it which is what you want to do but like every other hole out here there is trouble if you go too far left or right but seeing how this is a par 5 and you want to try to reach it in two to give yourself a shot at eagle its a great hole to tee it high and let it fly
1455619 be aware on each hole try to find the 150 yard marker on each hole which we mark with a stake its a good point of reference to work backwards from you need to have good course management skills on this course each hole youve got to think about it you dont want to go out there and grab the driver on every par 4 and par 5 and swing away that can get you in a whole lot of trouble be aware of the trouble out there its right in front of you there isnt too much hidden on this course
1455620 i really wanted to get back to whatcom county and shuksan it is warm and sunny every day down there but it is too much of a rat race im from washington and i really missed it up here

1455629 its important for yahoos board to understand there is still pressure on them
1455630 i thought yahoos board was kind of let off the hook last week when they didnt really deserve to be
1455631 in essence it was a truncation error in the final printout
1455632 the problem was identified and it was fixed the error did not change the outcome
1455633 its not the final stop but it is a major stop in getting this bill done
1455634 for those who said this congress cannot come together in a bipartisan fashion to do something responsible about housing this bill does that
1455635 but there is too much that is important in this bill and it has already been too long delayed by procedural problems in the senate for us to risk the further delay involved in a veto
1455636 so that they can get a housing bill to the president that he could sign right away
1455637 i call on the administration to support this bill along with a second emergency stimulus package to jumpstart the economy and build on this important start to advance more rigorous measures to protect homeowners from foreclosure

1455667 my message to democratic lawmakers is this if youre really for increased american energy production then prove it by putting it in writing sign the discharge petitions house republicans are circulating that will force votes on energy legislation speaker pelosi refuses to bring to the floor and sign onto the american energy act our all of the above plan to increase conservation innovation and american energy production instead of doing the speakers bidding by voting against bringing it to a vote if you arent willing to put it in writing youre fooling no one youre siding with the speaker of the drill nothing congress and radical special interests that favor higher gas prices at the expense of energy strapped american families
1455668 in the house chamber and across the nation this week house republicans are standing united with the american people in protest of speaker pelosis decision to send congress home for five weeks without a vote on increased american energy
1455669 more than 1 4 million americans have signed a petition demanding that congress pass legislation to lower gas prices and increase production of american made energy tomorrow former speaker newt gingrich will join house republicans in the capitol to present a message on behalf of these americans and their families as our nationwide protest continues joining reps mike pence of indiana tom price of georgia and others who have courageously led this gop uprising on the house floor newts presence and support will further energize this unprecedented nationwide effort as we continue to call for congress to give the american people a vote on increased american energy
1455670 millions of americans have been forced to permanently suspend their vacation plans this summer thanks to the prohibitive cost of fuel all were asking is that democrats temporarily suspend theirs so we can finally have the debate on energy the american people expect and are frankly shocked we havent had
1455671 having former speaker gingrich lend his time and support to this campaign represents a tremendous boon to that effort it also provides a stark contrast to the lock it away position on american energy the current speaker of the house continues to advocate even as our dependence on middle east oil grows more dangerous and severe by the day
1455672 american families are crying out for relief at the pump and democrats have adjourned the house for a five week recess
1455673 tomorrow we will welcome speaker gingrich to help continue this unprecedented coast to coast effort to shine a spotlight on the democratic congresss failure to hold an up or down vote on the american energy act this legislation does it all and to solve americas energy crisis thats exactly what we need to be doing the american people support house republicans all of the above energy solutions in overwhelming numbers speaker pelosi needs to call congress back from its five week recess and hold the up or down vote on the american energy act and let the will of the house prevail
1455674 it is fitting the leader of the first republican revolution now returns to support this republican revolution for american energy security and independence
1455675 this fight will not go away until speaker pelosi allows an up or down vote on energy legislation that relieves the back breaking burden on our citizens
1455676 it is ridiculous to walk away from our critical work at a time like this for five weeks of vacation the chairs where democrats should be seated are now filled with everyday americans who have come to the house floor to listen and respond to the republican call for greater supplies of american made energy this is a vote that must occur i am proud that tomorrow former house speaker newt gingrich will be joining this effort here in washington and i also salute the republican congressmen and women scattered across the country working tirelessly to force a vote from speaker pelosi
1455677 we are in the midst of a genuine energy crisis and we need an all of the above energy policy to get out of it
1455678 that means energy alternatives like wind and solar as well as more domestic energy exploration the american people want us to take action and speaker pelosi is standing in the way i applaud my colleagues and former speaker gingrich for keeping up the fight for more american made energy

1455869 republican sen john mccain criticized sen barack obamas call for a windfall profits tax on the oil industry on tuesday despite leaving the door open to the same idea last month mccain criticized obama his democratic rival repeatedly in excerpts of a speech planned for delivery tuesday evening he cited obamas advocacy of a tax on excess oil industry profits as well as the democrats vote for president bushs energy legislation in 2005 mccain reserved his sharpest words for the windfall profits tax if that plan sounds familiar its because that was president carters big idea too im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s mccain said in the excerpts

1455877 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened
1455878 that shows whos pulling the strings on john mccains energy policy
1455879 the american people want a president who will put their interests ahead of john mccains oil company buddies and their lobbyists
1455880 the reviews are in and while the last seven years were a bonanza for big oil theyve been a bust for americas working families the american people have seen this show before and they arent looking for an encore

1455901 a lot of bands like the eagles and probably numerous other ones everyone sort of matures and they realize that its fantastic business and the impetuosity that comes with being very young and walking away from something that is really successful you kind of get over that

1455911 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
1455912 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
1455913 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
1455914 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
1455915 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
1455916 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together
1455917 continuing to substantially rely on purchased power agreements is no longer prudent
1455918 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him

1455944 they think teams are collaborative and co operative they are convinced that they will have it all work comes as a huge culture shock
1455945 by the time they are 28 they may have made a series of moves theyd say it was for more money or for a funded mba but there is i think an unconscious thought there too
1455946 theyre thinking work cant be like this everywhere it cant be this cold and unfeeling and this callous and when they hit 30 they have an early midlife crisis a thrisis they think how can i do this for the rest of my life they feel theyre not loved they are not respected and they are not even a number
1455947 they have totally unrealistic expectations and have a delusion in the value they will bring and the pay packet they should receive

1455965 ive front loaded the spend to ensure we get strong return
1455966 and left a good bit of fat in there this was the 1980s in case we have a profit call
1455967 now weve been a little bullish with the such and such number
1455968 but we reckon that we should be comfortably covered in the first half of the year because this other number has been hedged on
1455969 of course theres a fair bit of fat in these numbers so we have a fall back in case of difficult conditions later in the year
1455970 and weve front loaded the spends for product x and product y

1455989 and what that might do ultimately is to take a one day experience to a two day or even a multi day experience
1455990 for example most people will spend 40 50 per person per day on a day visit to an attraction like this in the area not just with us but in the area

1455999 people trust that they can call and give us information and were going to make an arrest
1456000 the calls are not taped or traced we take the information follow up on it if we make an arrest the caller is eligible for a reward

1456040 i would wake up at 7 00 a m and be ready to be in bed again by 9 00 a m
1456041 whew i dont have to worry about being hard closed by this guy hes a marketing rep
1456042 im getting ready to hire of couple of new sales reps and id like your opinion
1456043 im going to hire an inside sales rep to pound the phones and uncover new leads and an outside rep to meet with companies face to face and close those leads the only issue is my outside guy has been with a competitor for the last 5 years and has a non compete agreement that locks him out of the state for 2 years i can get him to call on companies outside of this territory but he wont be able to sell to any of his old clients hell have to generate all new business
1456044 i probably have 50 different opportunities i could be pursuing right now to be honest i cant even keep up with them all but im not giving them to him that would be like handing him free money
1456045 so let me go this straight you expect a guy thats developed a base of business over the last 5 years to start from scratch calling on companies that have never heard of you and you have no intentions of providing him with any existing clients or leads
1456046 tim youve got a highly successful business despite the fact youre not doing any marketing whatsoever youre situation is unique because you guys were able to pick up highly profitable clients as a result of your old companys marketing efforts now youre in a situation where you need to start generating new clients and youre trying to do it the same boneheaded way we did it 15 years ago from your years of experience in this industry what do you think the ratio is of bad sales reps to those that are successful long term
1456047 then look at it this way youre going to have to go through 19 sales people before you find one thats going to be worth your investment off the cuff i can think of at least a dozen of marketing ideas you could be doing right now to generate new opportunities start with your website which by the way needs a complete overhaul youre in the technology industry yet you dont invest a dime in online or offline for that matter advertising you could be putting out a catalog writing a blog hosting technology forums a million different things why dont you take that same money you were going to pay the telemarketer and put it into some of these initiatives that put you in front of those people that are already looking for your services
1456048 im going to be in your area next week and wanted to see if i could stop by for a few minutes how does tuesday at 10 a m sound
1456049 i dont want a job hopper i want someone with a stable work history
1456050 whats the biggest challenge youre running into with new salespeople
1456051 the bottom line is theyre either not ramping up the way we expect them to or theyre bailing after 12 18 months as soon as a new opportunity comes along
1456052 we need our reps to hit the ground running we provide some basic product training when they start but its not like a formalized 6 week boot camp by any means we just dont have the resources to do that were not a huge company essentially we leave it up to the individual to determine those areas where they need training and then theyre responsible for finding the educational resources the reps that do well with our company are the ones that take the initiative to be successful the ones that stand around waiting for you to send them to product seminars and complain about the lack of marketing materials and support are the ones that dont make it
1456053 most of the people youve been hiring are just not that interested in your products and services
1456054 they just see your job as a means to an end and as soon as an opportunity comes along that sounds better where they can make the same money they leave

1456117 but as bud said his knowledge of the history of the game was unbelievable hed write a column that was so clear and so concise about some historical thing and id ask him how long did it take you to research his and he said i didnt have to research it i already knew it it was just amazing he really was one of a kind and were all going to miss him i know im going to miss him and every time i light up a cigar im going to think about him
1456118 within tribune tower jerome had another legacy and that was a great hole that was left when he departed us
1456119 i went through time and time again these october sessions and the comments were made among the veteran folks on the publishing side theres no personality at the newspaper were missing something in the sports section where is the next jerome holtzman
1456120 for me not knowing him well it became like the samuel beckett play waiting for godot and as i left the tribune last year i can tell you at the last session the same comment was made from all the previous years where is the next jerome holtzman id say at least in the newspaper business or the next great medium that follows it at least here in chicago for as long as all of the people who read jerome for those many years the same question will be asked of us where is the next jerome holtzman
1456121 i remember covering one of the early labor disputes in baseball and jerome knowing as much about the intricacies and legalities of the situation as any of the participants and negotiators
1456122 we all know how in the press box hed hum and smoke his cigar while typing a story sitting next to him i just took that as a challenge to focus harder while i was writing periodically waving the cigar smoke away from my laptop screen so i could see what was there
1456123 i loved how he handled the acerbic george bell the toronto outfielder
1456124 i remember one day during the playoffs when he hurried from the minnesota dugout to the tigers bench where the manager sparky anderson had just finished talking to a group of departing reporters he spotted jerome and acknowledged his old friend jerome said sparky im on deadline just give me your a material and naturally jerome got it
1456125 in one of his first columns i edited i asked him the name of an anonymous source
1456126 then there was the day when i said jerry the best item in your notebook column is your third item why dont we make that the lead jerry agreed its the best item definitely then he calmly said you cant always put the best item first because you want readers to know that they have to read the whole column every time they pick it up it is said that one of the great joys of life is the destination but really its the journey and the people you meet along the way thanks jerry i will always cheer for you
1456127 he had such an easy style in that way he wrote
1456128 i called jerome at home and said do you have the number for marvin miller he said yeah and right off the top of his head he gave me the number i got miller all because i had the easy button it went on like that for three more calls all because i hit the easy button we dont have that easy button any more i think jerome just got tired of the whole thing and probably took it with him so i miss you jerome thank you very much and god bless you
1456129 as a wet behind the ears reporter many years ago i was introduced to the art of baseball writing by one jerome holtzman in a rather rude way
1456130 nearly 30 years later when troy percival shunned the cubs for the tigers i wrote a lead with jerome in mind on purpose which read as the lobster bisque was being served troy percival shunned the cubs
1456131 one valuable lesson he taught all of us maybe without knowing it was he always insisted that the best job at any paper was baseball writer
1456132 and so in remembrance to jeromes most famous book no cheering in the press box may i suggest that every baseball writer stand up and cheer the next time he or she is in the press box as a salute to our hall of fame dean a doff of the chapeau jerome and godspeed i know you arrived in good time someone upstairs is enjoying an eternitys worth of stories
1456133 dick dozer worked for the tribune jerome for the sun times and myself for the chicago daily news and warren brown was a columnist for the chicago american
1456134 i remember one time we were together and after spring training the teams would play some exhibition games in some of the minor league towns in the south
1456135 we always had a lot of laughs and i miss jerry myself and i love him like a brother
1456136 ive known jerome since 87 when i started covering baseball part time
1456137 the players were all back and jerome came a couple days later and as soon as he came out onto the field there was ozzie guillen frank thomas lance johnson alex fernandez robin ventura tim raines just the whole team lined up to shake jeromes hand to welcome him back and tell him how much they missed him and appreciated him i thought to myself for these guys to have that much respect for a guy that really wasnt on their side during the strike it just spoke volumes about the man and what he meant to them and what he meant to baseball to me his legacy as a writer an author a great human being is that he did it the right way and there are too few writers and broadcasters that do it that way anymore
1456138 i want to tell you that being jerome holtzmans son was much different than youd imagine
1456139 i cant tell you why but dad didnt really bring sports to the dinner table
1456140 i have to tell you in a funny way my father prepared me for his death
1456141 we will be 100 off oil in just 10 years

1456188 w hen iraq finally admitted having these weapons in 1995 the quantities were vast less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax a little bit about this amount this is just about the amount of a teaspoon less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax in an envelope shutdown the united states senate in the fall of 2001 this forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment and killed two postal workers just from an amount just about this quantity that was inside of an envelope
1456189 the anthrax in the tainted letter sent to senate majority leader tom daschle was laced with bentonite
1456190 a troubling chemical additive that authorities consider their first significant clue yet
1456191 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
1456192 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
1456193 the anthrax found in a letter to senator daschle is nearly identical to samples they recovered in iraq in 1994
1456194 the anthrax spores found in the letter to senator daschle are almost identical in appearance to those they recovered in iraq in 1994 when viewed under an electron microscope

1456214 id sit in the priests chair go to the pulpit make believe i was preaching and giving communion
1456215 i do not know enough to answer that but i am sure that if you went to rome and argued with the cardinals and the great teachers of our church they would have an answer for you
1456216 not really i just went there saw the people who ran the place saw the way they managed things and came to the conclusion that if an organization ran like that had lasted so many centuries then god really must have been protecting it

1456229 the problem with humanae vitae is rigidity the pontiff was correct in seeing what strange fruits the revolution would produce but his cure was as bad or worse than the disease
1456230 i am proud to belong to a church which retains as no other church retains the affectionate loyalty of many who make little or no attempt to practice what the church preaches the catholic religion is based on certain obective facts of which the resurrection is the most important facts such as these are unaffected by your conduct or by mine and it is therefore illogical to deny those facts merely because our conduct is not consistent with our belief the catholic is more objective than the protestant for protestants often cease to believe merely because they cease to behave whereas many a catholic who has cut himself off by his own actions from the sacraments continues to hear mass every sunday as a boy i believed that protestants were more moral and more truthful than catholics i now know that the widespread belief in the moral superiority of protestants is due to the failure of the protestant churches to retain their hold on the disreputable the reputation of the church suffers perhaps from the fact than an american gangster or a neopolitan brigand will attend mass whereas a criminal with a protestant background never gives scandal to protestants by attending protestant services
1456231 on july 25 1968 pope paul vi issued humanae vitae his famous encyclical on the regulation of birth little did he suspect the ambush being brewed by catholic theologians in the united states whose ringleader was fr charles curran word of the encyclical reached america by publication on july 29 the story of its reception is told by catholic historian kenneth whitehead in an article in the march april 1998 issue of catholic dossier quotation omitted here whitehead is diplomatic he says the signers of the statement many if not most of them among the churchs own working theologians issued their declaration by consciously setting aside the teaching of the second vatican council i am not so diplomatic i say they lied they were liars and in some cases they are still liars and what happened to these lying catholic theologians many of whom were in official positions in dioceses or religious orders or catholic colleges and thus on the churchs payroll did their bishops demand that they be honest and either rescind their signature or find another way to make a living no so far as i know nothing was done to any of the liars in fact most of them were eventually rewarded by promotions or by fame or by influence more influence among catholics indisputably than the bishops themselves have had

1456240 o mercado aprova os nossos alunos os alunos aprovam o nosso ensino
1456241 los que desde el principio lo vieron con sus ojos y fueron ministros de la palabra
1456242 there are two reasons why people start shouting at their opponents one is that they think the opponent is so strong that every weapon must be used against him the other is that they think their own case so weak that it has to be fortified by noise
1456243 i cant stand those olsen twins they have no talent ill tell you who i like that paris hilton she is so elegant and classy
1456244 when you look at the last 10 years of the bcs its clear that college football has never been
1456245 a mad old man who sits among the dogs singing to himself
1456246 simply a man who began arriving on mondays with the bags for animal welfare
1456247 one subsection of the visible consists of images and by images i mean first shadows then reflections in water and in all close packed smooth and shiny materials
1456248 in the other subsection of the visible put the originals of these images the animals around us the plants and the whole class of manufactured things
1456249 now the doctrine that is taught in secret about this matter is that we men are in a kind of prison and must not set ourselves free or run away
1456250 it goes away into that which is like itself into the invisible divine immortal and wise
1456251 who have indulged in gluttony and violence and drunkenness are likely to pass into the bodies of asses and other beasts of that sort and those who have chosen injustice and tyranny and robbery pass into the bodies of wolves and hawks and kites
1456252 the great archetypes of the mind pure ideas find themselves usurped by mere sense images
1456253 eye half turned toward the great archetypes of the imagination we carry within us
1456254 do you truly wish to see the beloved in the cold clarity of the visual apparatus it may be in your best interest to throw a veil over the gaze so as to keep her alive in her archetypal goddesslike form
1456255 we cannot live our daily lives in a realm of pure ideas cocooned from sense experience the question is not how can we keep the imagination pure protected from the onslaughts of reality the question has to be can we find a way for the two to coexist
1456256 kept as fleeting as possible as a means toward stirring or activating the idea that lies buried more deeply
1456257 sense organs reach the limit of their powers their light begins to go out
1456258 that light leaps up one last time giving us a glimpse of the invisible
1456259 into just another woman and him into just another client
1456260 re education reformation of character the code word was counselling

1456263 im not going back for the sake of an idea
1456264 do you hope you can expiate the crimes of the past by suffering in the present
1456265 but notice that lucy has never subscribed to metaphysical moral values her forte is refusing her fathers habit of seeing the world through metaphysical glasses
1456266 you have not been listening to me i am not the person you know
1456267 prepared to do anything make any sacrifice for the sake of peace
1456268 he has nothing against animal lovers the world would no doubt be a worse place without them
1456269 you think i ought to involve myself in more important things
1456270 there is no higher life this is the only life there is which we share with animals thats the example i try to follow to share some of our human privilege with the beasts
1456271 i agree this is the only life there is as for animals by all means let us be kind to them but let us not lose perspective we are of a different order of creation from the animals not higher necessarily just different
1456272 only as long as i do not have to become a better person
1456273 i dont think we are ready to die any of us without being escorted
1456274 beverly shaw not a veterinarian but a priestess full of new age mumbo jumbo trying absurdly to lighten the load of africas suffering beasts

1456277 a bond seems to have come into existence between himself and the two persians
1456278 it is not even a bond with these two in particular whom he could not pick out from a whole mob in a field
1456279 sheep do not own themselves do not own their lives
1456280 nothing escapes except perhaps the gall bladder descartes should have thought of that the soul suspended in the dark bitter gall hiding
1456281 his whole being is gripped by what happens in the theater
1456282 the more killings he assists in the more jittery he gets one sunday evening driving home he actually has to stop at the roadside to recover himself tears flow down his face that he cannot stop his hands shake
1456283 which among them get to live which get to die is not worth agonizing over
1456284 t he dogs in the yard smell what is going on inside they flatten their ears they droop their tails as if they too feel the disgrace of dying
1456285 which they somehow know is going to harm them terribly
1456286 the business of dog killing is over for the day the black bags are piled at the door each with a body and a soul inside
1456287 for himself for his idea of the world a world in which men do not use shovels to beat corpses into a more convenient shape for processing
1456288 in the bare compound behind the building he makes a nest of sorts with a table and an old armchair from the shaws and a beach umbrella to keep off the worst of the sun
1456289 an apple tree dropping wormridden food rampant weeds an area fenced with galvanized iron sheets wooden pallets old tyres
1456290 has learned by now from her to concentrate all his attention on the animal they are killing
1456291 from monday onward the dogs released from life within the walls of the clinic will be tossed into the fire unmarked unmourned for that betrayal will he ever be forgiven
1456292 of the dogs in the holding pens there is one he has come to feel a particular fondness for no visitor has shown an interest in adopting it its period of grace is almost over soon it will have to submit to the needle
1456293 he is sensible of a generous affection streaming out toward him from the dog arbitrarily unconditionally he has been adopted the dog would die for him he knows
1456294 would he dare do that bring a dog into the piece allow it to loose its own lament to the heavens between the strophes of lovelorn teresas
1456295 giving it what he no longer has difficulty in calling by its proper name love
1456296 it is this experience of finding oneself personally commanded by inexplicable unjustifiable impractical commitments to an idea of the wold that has room for the inconvenient that i am calling grace
1456297 is to find a way to build a new just state that is not founded on the elimination of unpredictability singularity excess
1456298 what is required of the imagination is not simply relocation of the self from one subject position to another position that is already presupposed and defined in opposition to a position it itself has vacated
1456299 the imagination must enable itself to occupy an uncommitted non position
1456300 the ethical relation that transcends history and may never become a part of history but which nevertheless constantly interrupts and so mediates those contestatory relations extant in history
1456301 between social orders but also between two identities one that is known and discarded and the other unknown and undetermined
1456302 9 she also believes that for coetzee this interregnum is never a series of temporal events tied to a particular historical space and time but as
1456303 all established oppositions and boundaries seem to be under threat of collapse a crisis of definition relationships and responsibilities lies at the heart of this privileging of the body is articulated with a great deal more theoretical detail in
1456304 is attending to the death of a fellow being who may just possess what for so long has been attributed only to human beings one of the marks of the absolute limit between the human and the animal an eternal living soul
1456305 that can reside in no one and nothing beyond his own animal being
1456306 textual presence that has access to untested notions of the truth
1456307 a mastery exercised by the thinker upon what is thought in which the objects resistance as an exterior being vanishes
1456308 through language the subject negates the being or presence of things
1456309 what things and beings would be if there were no world
1456310 the subjects failure to reduce the other to an object
1456311 means that he or she is surprised by the other
1456312 the ironic skeptical tautly cerebral voice in which coetzee treats textuality rationality and ideology grows silent and we hear emerging instead a voice that insists with a more visceral urgency on the direct factual and compelling reality of bodily suffering and death
1456313 emerge from under the shadows cast by the more obviously weighty ethical and political matters invoked by the text
1456314 i imagine that coetzee feels the force of almost all the ideas and emotions that his characters express he is working and living at the edge of our moral possibilities about animals much is fluid changing being created one positively ought to hold incompatible opinions as one works and lives ones way through to their resolution
1456315 the singularity of every living and dead being in this operation we find the operation of something called
1456316 but of course what binds me thus in my singularity to the singularity of the other immediately propels me into the space or risk of absolute sacrifice there are also the others an infinite number of them the innumerable generality of others to whom i should be bound by the same responsibility a general and universal italics mine responsibility what soren kierkegaard calls the ethical order i cannot respond to the call the request the obligation or even the love of another without sacrificing the other other the other others

1456330 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

1456353 my strong preference here is to handle all this us conflict with iran diplomatically with the other powers of government ours and many others as opposed to any kind of strike occurring from the us perspective from the united states military perspective in particular opening up a third front israeli and or us act of war against iran would be extremely stressful to us
1456354 if iran continues its nuclear arms program we will attack it the sanctions arent effective there will be no choice but to attack iran to halt the iranian nuclear program
1456355 the present economic sanctions on iran have exhausted themselves iranian businesspeople who would not be able to land anywhere in the world would pressure the regime
1456356 it was a triumphalist conference even this powerful organization aipac the most powerful group in the us israel lobby had never seen anything like seven thousand jewish functionaries from all over the united states came together to accept the obeisance of the entire washington elite the three presidential hopefuls hillary went too made speeches trying to outdo each other in flattery three hundred senators and members of congress crowded the hallways everybody who wanted to be elected or re elected to any office came to see and be seen
1456357 the president should prohibit the export to iran of all refined petroleum products imposing stringent inspection requirements in all persons vehicles ships planes trains and cargo ships enters and departing iran

1456359 american companies are prohibited from any involvement in irans energy sector those non us international groups that have invested in iran are for now going slow they are trying to avoid pressing ahead with investments that would anger washington while also trying to avoid pulling out which could annoy tehran
1456360 in 2004 aipac and its affiliated think tank the washington institute for near east policy winep lobbied for a new separate us treasury unit to be created the office of terrorism and financial intelligence otfi it is headed by aipac vetted leadership and many otfi briefings are delivered directly to winep oftis secretive financial operations that target iran and its trading partners are tightly coordinated with israels leadership
1456361 we have to consider the sources of support the corporate sector in the us which dominates policy formation appears to be quite satisfied with the current situation one indication is the increasing flow of investment to israel by intel hewlett packard microsoft and other leading elements of the high tech economy military and intelligence relations remain very strong since 1967 us intellectuals have had a virtual love affair with israel for reasons that relate more to the us than to israel in my opinion that strongly affects portrayal of events and history in media and journals

1456817 the entrenched clerical system of patriarchal power in addition to creating conditions in which the sex abuse scandal could occur has also at times been deeply suspicious of the charism of religious life and where it would lead the church i think of the jesuits and justice of the option of so many womens religious orders for a collegial style of leadership and obedience etc

1456821 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

1456849 for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly for one will scarcely die for a righteous person though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of god for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life more than that we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation

1456857 we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to

1456867 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1456868 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1456869 normally id just let such a report fall through the cracks of my mind and asz
1456870 this letter which appears to support two highly dubious pre war claims by the bush administration the link between saddam and al qaeda and the niger uranium claim is
1456871 remember when you would try to tell your friends that the case for war in iraq was fabricated that there were no mass stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and that saddam hussein had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
1456872 you make some valid points and i commend you for your courage to make them on this forum

1456874 mccain wants to give oil companies another 4 billion in tax breaks
1456875 everyone who is seriously interested in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe a spirit vastly superior to man and one in the face of which our modest powers must feel humble
1456876 its drivel its arguing that the only plausible cause is a god because theres no perfect alternative so instead of the intellectual honesty of admitting that not all things have a valid explanation for their existence god is assumed to be the cause never mind if theres any other corroboration of his existence and not some generic god that just began the universe but a specific religion associated deity creationist hogwash is what it is an apparent abuse of occams razor we dont always know the answers the end
1456877 einstein was a genius he didnt need intellectual honesty that is for ordinary people like you and me he was gifted and he simply understood the source of that gift something people who are not genius or intuitive or right brained wouldnt know a thing about

1456919 i dont think hes shown enough remorse for what hes done
1456920 i want him haunted day in and day out just like we are
1456921 i know he says he was the lookout too bad
1456922 im satisfied with these sentences because i believe hell never get out of the penitentiary and that was my goal that he would never get out of the penitentiary the rest of his life
1456923 i think this is absolutely an important topic and needs to be addressed
1456924 i guess what im asking is that we have just a little bit of time to discuss it
1456925 theres a possibility that things will be done quicker this way than with the time it takes to address this and form a task force
1456926 when we got these we looked at these very hard because we didnt want to kill people
1456927 we got them and we did it quietly but we have used them restrictedly and i think our record the past three years has shown that
1456928 certainly that was one option but not the option i chose
1456929 last weeks scores reminded us that columbia public schools has some work to do to achieve the excellence our community wants and deserves

1456934 go hang a thousand times they have no basis they have no claim on zimbabwe politics at all
1456935 what is happening in zimbabwe is a shame and an embarrassment to africa in the eyes of the international community and should be denounced
1456936 the vote fell short of the african unions standards of democratic elections
1456937 the result that comes out of that process of dialogue must be a result that is agreed by the zimbabweans
1456938 even ten years ago what mugabe has done would be a non event
1456939 now a significant and increasing number of african leaders are embarrassed even angry about his behavior
1456940 mugabe has been able to keep his supporters going because of their belief that africa is on their side and they will ultimately prevail
1456941 the moment they realize that that is no longer the case mugabe or his cabal will weaken dramatically
1456942 well doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy
1456943 today we lack metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror
1456944 the cias program damages our national security by weakening our legal and moral authority and by providing al qaeda and other terrorist groups a recruiting and motivational tool
1456945 by continuing this interrogation program the president is sacrificing our strategic advantage for questionable tactical gain
1456946 a large body of all source reporting indicates that activists identifying themselves as jihadists although still a small percentage of muslims are increasing in both numbers and geographical dispersion
1456947 if this trend continues threats to us interests at home and abroad will become more diverse leading to increasing attacks worldwide
1456948 i came away from my many visits to the middle east convinced there is a widespread belief that if america abuses prisoners then there can be no true freedom for anyone
1456949 it seemed to me that our greatest sin in the eyes of muslims was not invading the middle east or even our support of israel our greatest sin was robbing muslims of hope
1456950 we were right from the beginning in using all means including military tribunals to combat terrorism
1456951 if weve been holding these guys for so long how can we explain letting them get off

1456970 long rangy body flared out above his black silk panties
1456971 fleming wrote so well almost as well as raymond chandler
1456972 some maps he had bought from the hotel shop the country was between turkey to the west and afghanistan to the east its southern frontier was the persian gulf its northern limit the caspian sea
1456973 science fiction rubbish negro homosexual rubbish or dope taking nervous breakdown rubbish
1456974 the life of a secret agent is dangerous enough but the life of a double agent is infinitely more precarious
1456975 your friend bobby the pig grows fatter every day he is gorging now like a king roars like a lion and shits like an elephant fritz
1456976 reckless and impetuous moody and sentimental he becomes on acquaintance an extraordinarily likeable character
1456977 one of the bravest men who served in the last war
1456978 the cheap self assertiveness of young labor since the war
1456979 the americans saved your bacon twice but your failure to support their crazed adventure in vietnam has made them angry with you they will not be so generous on this occasion
1456980 we still climb everest and beat plenty of the world at sports
1456981 one of the most pitiful bungles in the history of the world
1456982 three men who looked like greasy greedy semites to ruin the heroic aryan causing his bankruptcy and plunging him into the oblivion in which he died
1456983 one must look at rembrandt if one really wants to see the jews
1456984 the way christ gestures with his arm undoubtedly has something jewish about it
1456985 farewell good land our thoughts strengthen us of our ancestors old havens of the proud city where rembrandts friends worked and of the quiet town where spinoza once thought
1456986 much of what we think about rembrandt and his art stems ultimately from his decision to live there
1456987 only in rembrandts case is it emphasized that he lived in the jewish quarter
1456988 is that their subjects possess a beard and a head covering
1456989 in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain
1456990 is unknown in any other painting or print of the time
1456991 that rembrandt had any special interest in the contents of this book or its jewish author is unlikely
1456992 to further clarify my writings i have ordered with great propriety four figures
1456993 the rembrandt presented by the terra film company is not our rembrandt
1456994 vaarwel goed land het denken geeft ons sterkte aan de oude havens van ons voorgeslacht de stoere stad waar rembrandts vrienden werkten en t stille dorp waar eens spinoza dacht
1456995 and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other
1456996 iuntamente para mayor claridad de lo que se dize he hecho en laminas con grande propriedad 4 figures
1456997 god exists because he is the only cause which can explain the universe and all the complexities contained in it allegedly
1456998 thanks for the nice mention of original yogatoes in your blog
1456999 he has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but he is in good spirits
1457000 he is going to have surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1457001 they had to use the jaws of life hydraulic cutters to extract him from the vehicle
1457002 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1457003 sources have even reported that rocsi stayed at the misick home and hosted guests as if she was the lady of the house
1457004 please she cant perform live her voice on the single is so mixed and electronicized you dont know what she really sounds like any more
1457005 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1457006 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1457007 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1457008 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1457009 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live
1457010 quiero reconocer y agradecer sinceramente la postura de los diputados de la udi y de muchos de sus dirigentes puesto que sin duda refleja generosidad y grandeza
1457011 la alianza requerir una enorme cuota de unidad generosidad y grandeza
1457012 y respetar los tiempos y los plazos que la udi se ha impuesto en este campo
1457013 no le har a bien al partido levantar a alguien por mezquindad o s lo para perjudicar a pi era
1457014 nuestro nico objetivo hacia adelante es que la alianza gane la pr xima elecci n presidencial si pi era es el mejor posicionado no s lo dentro de la alianza sino que enfrentando a cualquiera de la concertaci n cuanto antes debi ramos actuar con generosidad y realismo

1457016 amazons cd buyers tend to be older so they havent abandoned the cd format to the extent seen in the average music buyer
1457017 plus amazons successful introduction of its digital download store will help the company improve its position in the future
1457018 will consolidate its lead in the retail music market as cd sales continue to slow

1457022 e m forster never gets any further than warming the teapot
1457023 hes a rare fine hand at that feel this teapot is it not beautifully warm yes but there aint going to be no tea
1457024 now you have to be cool over yeats he was a great poet he lived poetry but there was an element of bunkum in him
1457025 savoury or unsavoury who battens on higher forms of life
1457026 why dont you write sensible books that people can understand
1457027 i dont want a complete coleridge ive got the ancient mariner in some anthology or other and thats enough the ancient mariner and kubla khan and perhaps the first half of christabel thats all in coleridge that really matters the rest is rubbish and not even good dry rubbish its moist clammy rubbish its depressing
1457028 what a pity what a pity to go on about the subconscious and the solar plexus and maleness and femaleness and african darkness and the cosmic battle when you can write with such insight about human beings and so beautifully about flowers
1457029 i know what i know and i like what i like and thats the kind of chap i am
1457030 good god man its not what i think that matters im paying my license fee to hear what you think
1457031 the books uneven bits of it are perfunctory but bits are awfully good
1457032 humanism has its dangers the humanist shirks responsibility dislikes making decisions and is sometimes a coward
1457033 this is such a difficult moment to live in one cannot help getting gloomy and also a bit rattled and perhaps short sighted
1457034 moved from being a bolshie to being a die hard
1457035 shes english im english and my fondness for her may be rather a family affair
1457036 i dont know whether i am overpraising the book its values happen to coincide with my own and one does then tend to overpraise
1457037 responsible for more unkind feelings and more silly thinking than any other pair of words i know
1457038 apa yang kau amat amati sehingga satu setengah hari kau habiskan waktumu disini
1457039 tentu saja aku harus berhati hati aku harus mendapatkan emas 24 karat itu
1457040 seandainya emas 24 karat itu tidak pernah ada atau hanya ada satu diantara setumpuk emas ini apakah engkau masih saja mencarinya sedangkan waktumu sangat terbatas
1457041 tentu saja tidak aku akan mengambil emas terakhir yang ada ditanganku begitu waktuku habis
1457042 hai orang kaya apa yang kau cari disini bukankah engkau sudah lebih dari cukup
1457043 bagiku hidup adalah uang kalau aku bisa mengambil emas ini tentu saja itu berarti menambah keuntunganku
1457044 mengapa engkau diam disini tidakkah engkau memilih emas emas itu atau tekadmu sudah bulat untuk mengambil emas itu
1457045 atau engkau yakin bahwa itulah emas 24 karat sehingga engkau tidak lagi berusaha mencari yang lain
1457046 tuan saya ini orang miskin saya tidak pernah tahu mana yang emas dan mana yang kuningan tetapi hati saya memilih emas ini sayapun tidak tahu berapa kadar emas ini atau jika ternyata emas ini hanya kuninganpun saya juga tidak tahu
1457047 lalu mengapa engkau tidak mencoba bertanya kepada mereka atau kepadaku kalau engkau tidak tahu
1457048 tuan emas dan kuningan ini milik raja jadi menurut saya hanya raja yang tahu mana yang emas dan mana yang kuningan mana yang 1 karat dan mana yang 24 karat tapi satu hal yang saya percaya janji raja untuk mengubah kuningan menjadi emas itu yang lebih penting
1457049 bagi saya berapapun kadar karat emas ini cukup buat saya karena kalau saya bekerja saya membutuhkan waktu bertahun tahun menabung untuk membeli emas tuan
1457050 lagi pula tuan peraturannya saya tidak boleh menukar emas yang sudah saya ambil
1457051 tidakkah engkau mengambil emas emas yang lain dan menukarkannya sekarang selagi masih ada waktu
1457052 saya sudah menggunakan waktu itu kini waktu setengah hari terakhir saya inilah saatnya saya mengambil keputusan jika saya gantikan emas ini engan yang lain belum tentu saya mendapat yang lebih baik dari punya saya ini saya memutuskan untuk mengabdi pada raja dan merawat milik saya ini untuk menjadikannya emas yang murni
1457053 wahai rakyatku yang kukasihi semua emas yang kau genggam itu adalah hadiah yang telah kuberikan sesuai dengan perjanjian tidak seorangpun diperbolehkan menukar ataupun menyia nyiakan hadiah itu jika didapati hal diatas maka orang itu akan mendapat hukuman karena ia tidak menghargai raja
1457054 dan ketahuilah bahwa sebenarnya tidak ada emas 24 karat itu hal ini dimaksudkan bahwa kalian semua harus mengabdi kepada kerajaan dan hanya akulah yang dapat menambah jumlah karat itu karena akulah yang memilikinya selama satu setengah hari setengah hari yang kedua yaitu saat kuberikan waktu kepada kalian semua untuk merenungkan pilihan kalian kutunggu untuk datang kepadaku menanyakan perihal emas itu tetapi sayang sekali hanya satu orang yang datang kepadaku untuk menanyakannya
1457055 the complexity of the modern day relationship of chinese to the outside world
1457056 well feel free to challenge me all you want just keep in mind im always right
1457057 oh come on these kids are grateful for whatever work i give them they come from a place where astrology is considered a science and toilets a luxury
1457058 we chinese carry the burden of our history with us and the question of western humiliation is always unconsciously inside us
1457059 throughout the ages chinese have had only one way of looking at foreigners
1457060 we either look up to them as gods or down on them as wild animals
1457061 the west is central to the construction of chinas identity today it has become chinas alter ego
1457062 to serve the political ideological rhetorical and or emotional needs of the present
1457063 experienced several decades of economic oppression by the foreign powers
1457064 as a consequence is being transformed everywhere into a colony
1457065 ours will no longer be a nation subject to insult and humiliation we have stood up
1457066 the occupation of hong kong was the epitome of the humiliation that china suffered in modern history
1457067 the chinese people cannot be bullied the chinese race cannot be insulted
1457068 the century of humiliation both reflect and powerfully shape chinas relations with the west today
1457069 by evoking the people events and symbols of chinas early modern encounter with the west chinese continually return to this unresolved trauma
1457070 neither communisms victory over the nationalist party in the civil war nor the declaration of liberation in 1949 appears to have exorcised the past
1457071 the world has a new lever to try and win better behavior from china
1457072 a wolf wrapped in a monks robe a monster with a human face but the heart of a beast
1457073 through their coverage and handling of the beijing torch relay the west seemed to remind the chinese they were still not equal and they were still not good enough
1457074 he would not be under arrest unless it absolutely vital to making progress in the investigation a release would prevent us from progressing
1457075 are we capturing killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting training and deploying against us
1457076 based on my experience in talking to al qaeda members
1457077 futile and immoral policy of containment which abandons countless human beings to a despotism and godless terrorism
1457078 im not going to be the one to announce this decision you need to address your interest in this to the state department
1457079 has mostly been to play charlie brown perennially falling down as lucy yanks away the football swearing not to be fooled again
1457080 an action opposed by russia and china will not suddenly gain new legitimacy in russian or chinese eyes simply because a group from which they are excluded says so
1457081 his knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasized that this is the guy whos ready to be commander in chief
1457082 its a very clear choice and whether it be on iran or whether it be on iraq or whether it be on other national security issues
1457083 senator obama does not have the experience and the knowledge and clearly the judgment my friends
1457084 i will not accept from senator obama who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform any lectures on my regard for those who did
1457085 liberals saw the savagery of the 9 11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers
1457086 we have only two choices appeasement or war suicide or surrender humiliation or holocaust to be either red or dead
1457087 since 9 11 our principal export to the world has been our fear
1457088 when people feel uncertain theyd rather have somebody whos strong and wrong than somebody whos weak and right
1457089 securing stabilizing and rebuilding iraq progress report some gains made updated strategy needed
1457090 coercive interrogation techniques do they work are they reliable and what did the fbi know about them
1457091 at this point some of the looters stopped their work because when ayatollah al sistani says something they listen
1457092 is nothing less than the eradication of the material record of the worlds first urban literate civilization
1457093 one shouldnt underestimate the role that local people can play in this
1457094 no doubt that at lagash they were actively preventing looting at other places they might have been actively engaged in it
1457095 the threat of hostilities and presumably the mistaken expectation of increased security by the us invaders thereafter
1457096 and they control the towns where the antiquities trade is run
1457097 antiquities are the most precious relics the iraqis possess showing the world that our country is the legitimate offspring of previous civilizations which offered a great contribution to humanity
1457098 saddam was telling the people of southern iraq its not your civilization
1457099 that at the same time the united states was enforcing against iraq the most rigorous sanctions regime in history tens of thousands of previously undocumented iraqi antiquities were sold openly on the us market
1457100 the no fly zone in the south of iraq was essential to the trade
1457101 without iraqi helicopter surveillance it was very difficult for the iraqi authorities to control the countryside
1457102 some of the followers of sadr were writing on banners at some of the archaeological sites that muqtada does not stop anyone from looting if they would sell the looted objects to get weapons or build a mosque
1457103 he told me he had a lot of information about the smugglers and the black market
1457104 custodian of ancient cities and monuments that have to be maintained and repaired
1457105 remote sensing of cultural heritage in iraq a case study of isin
1457106 only mom and dad know what will work best for their family so be confident in the choice that you make the best way to deal with people who question your choice is to simply tell them politely but firmly that you have discussed how to feed your baby with your babys doctor feel good about your decision and be confident your baby is getting the essential nutrients he needs
1457107 look ive discussed my decision to terminate this pregnancy with my doctor and she agrees its a good idea healthy for me its the right decision for my family as well im confident in this decision so you need to butt out
1457108 any decision a woman makes about reproduction thus becomes vaguely connected to her
1457109 in breastfeeding advocacy we see how much economic self sufficiency makes breastfeeding a difficult practice to sustain for most women 5 this is why in my view the structure of market work is one thing that must change in order to accommodate true maternal freedom which would involve a relatively unconstrained ability to breastfeed ones children
1457110 douglass park has been an ongoing source of hard feelings and we never should have done that
1457111 the city went through with it but we wished we never would have done it so dont do it now
1457112 represents roughly 3 percent of the 900 parcels in the area
1457113 with the overlay 60 percent of the business owners do not want it so youve got 3 percent of the people driving something that 60 percent of the owners dont want
1457114 where have these people been for the past two years ive never seen any of these guys come to our meetings
1457115 i think our association cares a lot more about their businesses than they care about our houses
1457116 i admit that it took an issue to bring people forward but for the first time i see people checking in
1457117 we should embrace the people who want to have a voice in this community
1457118 sim haver algumas coisas como n o poder ter mais de tr s inimigos na tela ao mesmo tempo ent o tivemos que ter certeza que isso estaria no nosso game na parte do drag o com fogo imagen abaixo os objetos ficar o piscando
1457119 to deliver the right force with the right readiness at the right cost at the right time today and in the future
1457120 its about collaborating sharing and enhancing our business practices not to turn the navy into a business but to understand the business of the navy so that we remain the most effective and efficient navy in the world
1457121 be recognized as a legitimate human emotion that can be central to learning and creativity
1457122 appreciates the beauty in imperfection and the discarding of the non essential

1457124 we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to
1457125 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
1457126 to sink the foe or save the maimed our mission and our pride well carry on til kingdom come ideals for which weve died
1457127 a further proposal is the definite expansion of the coast guard in the matter of border patrol
1457128 navy and coast guard losses were 4 729 killed and 4 640 wounded
1457129 i was just reading about the coast guards icebreaker that has been closer to the north pole than any other ship in delivering food and supplies to a station up there that my young friends is what makes this country great
1457130 its our prayer to serve america in peace its our commitment to defend her in war

1457140 i think what you have here is the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa fla
1457141 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1457142 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1457143 customer engagement is a more measured way of defining customer experience
1457144 youve got one life youve got a limited amount of it you dont know how long its gonna be
1457145 living rich to me is like i always say life is about people and not about things and so living rich consists of spending time with family friends and all the people you love cause you never know how finite that time is even more so thats what makes life rich its about people its about relationships its about loved ones its about friends make a memory life is about people people get caught up with day to day errands and shopping and things that you wont even remember them it wont even register on your radar screen but if you set up an activity with your kids or you take advantage of some vacation opportunity you just make some sort of memory youll never regret it
1457146 it means trying to do things that really are enriching where youre learning youre growing youre challenging yourself you know in my case its keeping up with old skills like making sure i keep my piano up making sure that i stay writing and doing the things that i love to do so when i live rich i dont give up it means i still try to learn stuff and i richly tackle new challenges and problems
1457147 and i chose the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
1457148 and so i just think about every day we have to make choices and their outcome might seem small but the significance of making that choice might seem teeny it might be i go to my sons soccer game or i drag myself out when im cold and tired go see my sister speak in church and all these choices get harder when you have a trial or this adversity like were experiencing
1457149 na verdade eu acho que o cristianismo a religi o que mais claramente merece ser honrada e respeitada quer seja verdade ou n o sua afirma o de que uma revela o divina
1457150 in my library are about a thousand volumes of biography a rough calculation indicates that more of these deal with men who have talked themselves upward than with all the scientists writers saints and doers combined talkers have always ruled they will continue to rule the smart thing is to join them
1457151 the ability to express an idea is well nigh as important as the idea itself
1457152 when the conduct of men is designed to be influenced persuasion kind unassuming persuasion should ever be adopted it is an old and a true maxim that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall so with men if you would win a man to tour cause first convince him that you are his sincere friend therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart which sat what he will is the great high road to his reason and which once gained you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of tour cause if indeed that cause really be a just one on the contrary assume to dictate to his judgment or to command his action and he will retreat within himself close all the avenues to his head and his heart such is man and so must he be understood by those who would lead him
1457153 the spoken word is almost the polar opposite of the written word in the spoken medium what you sat must be believed to have impact believability is overwhelmingly determined at a preconscious level
1457154 old adage that you have to spend money to make money

1457161 hey i lay in the hospital for 6 weeks just so that you would come out healthy
1457162 one of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit everyone knows this each of us contributes his share but we tend to take the situation for granted most people are rather confident of their ability to recongnize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it so the phenomenon has not attracted much deliberate concern nor attracted much sustained inquiry
1457163 i saw indy with jesse this afternoon and tried to fall asleep in it but it was too noisy
1457164 we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to

1457254 the notice period can be changed but it is not possible to speak on behalf of congress
1457255 unconditional is not a very good word in this context there is a huge amount of work on this understanding and therefore to use the word unconditional to me is oversimplification i will be hoping only for a clean exemption that is my personal view and not of the u s government
1457256 people to listen seriously and hope at the end of the day they will accept we would not wish to see the additional points raised so that they become part of the process this is a very complex process and we are now moving to the final stage and obviously we hope that all players come together at the nsg and accept that the aim of this to normalise civilian nuclear process with india

1457261 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
1457262 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
1457263 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
1457264 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters could look very bad

1457270 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1457271 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are literally being eaten to extinction
1457272 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1457273 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1457274 the system is not just for compressing the data its a synthesis of advanced technologies and research into pedagogy

1457320 a key step in the durable control of hiv infection requires enhancing the development of memory immune responses and the stimulation of potent cytotoxic t cells through therapeutic vaccination
1457321 working with our colleagues at the universit de montr al we have shown that argos approach of transfecting dendritic cells with autologous hiv specific antigens effectively activates dendritic cells and enhances the hiv specific t cell response we believe that these results support our methods of developing potent immunotherapies that help patients immune systems more effectively fight hiv infection
1457322 we believe that this improvement may represent a significant step forward
1457323 the fact that we can stimulate a specific long term immune response gives us great hope that with additional development we will be able to give people infected with hiv a new option to battle the virus
1457324 the co transfection of monocyte derived dendritic cells dc by different combinations of hiv antigen rna and molecular adjuvant rna enhanced the response of hiv specific cd8 t cells

1457328 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1457329 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1457330 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1457331 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1457332 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1457333 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1457334 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1457335 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice

1457352 mccain made signifciant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1457353 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1457354 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping

1457379 concluding that the world court cannot force texas to release convicted murderers last march the u s supreme court rejected medellins claims and found that he would have received the same sentence with or without consular notification said jerry strickland a spokesman for the texas attorney generals office
1457380 the law is clear texas is bound not by the world court but by the u s supreme court which reviewed this matter and determined that this convicted murderers execution shall proceed strickland said of medellins case
1457381 medellin was one of six teenagers arrested and charged with the gang rape and murders of elizabeth pena 16 and jennifer ertman 14
1457382 evidence showed the girls were gang raped for more than an hour then were kicked and beaten before being strangled a red nylon belt was pulled so tight around ertmans neck that the belt snapped
1457383 four days later the girls bodies were found decomposing and mummifying in 100 degree heat culminating a frantic search by families and police under the glare of intense media coverage a tip from the brother of one of the gang members led police to arrest medellin and the others
1457384 one of the gang members convicted for the slayings derrick obrien was executed last year obrien said medellin was at one end of a belt being pulled around ertmans neck as he yanked on the other
1457385 so the criminal offense is relevant to whether the government should follow the law
1457386 no for the rule of law to mean anything which it does less and less in the u s as conservative ideologues have secured bench seats procedure is entirely separate from substance
1457387 telling the whole story e g the importance of mitigation is not a procedural matter but in the capital context is relevant to deathworthiness which is a substantive matter
1457388 t hat who the party is rather than what the law is is controlling this affair is evident from texass pleadings to the supreme court described in the scotusblog post in which they are asking to be allowed to proceed with illegally executing medellin by stating they will agree to follow the law in future cases this is how governments that have no respect for the rule of law behave
1457389 what if from tomorrow i will start to behave more eco friendly i cant change earths condition
1457390 in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with gods will

1457397 indeed some of spices and herbals are now sold as food supplements because of their recognized health benefits

1457409 this underscores the need for a fairer and more sensible process for selecting presidential nominees we have always been confident that michigan would have a full delegation and a full vote
1457410 today is a proud day for all of us who fought so hard to ensure floridians votes are fully counted obama has proved his commitment to uniting the party and ending the uncertainty surrounding the process
1457411 as always our goal is to ensure a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
1457412 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation

1457419 because of olympics certain types of abuses are increasing in china
1457420 these abuses are directly connected to the organization of olympics to have smooth olympics theyre basically abusing the rights of their own citizens at this moment
1457421 theyre satisfied with their country and 82 percent say their economy is good whats extraordinary about it is that it is almost a universal opinion its shared by just about everyone we polled
1457422 china is a freer better richer place then it was when it was awarded the games
1457423 but actually at closer examination what seemed to come through was firstly its more to do with things like opening up the economy as a whole and to do with odd things like the spread of mobile telephony the impact of that type of freedom by contrast most of the actual impact of the games themselves have tended to be in the opposite direction
1457424 organizers of the olympic games have been providing sufficient and convenient internet access
1457425 so they have a duty and responsibility they are not doing it for whatever reason
1457426 it has to be remembered that the ioc is a sports organization and electing beijing as the host city some seven years ago was really with a vision to see how sport and the coming together of the world could have a positive impact but its not for us to make direct statements on the matter of human rights its really a discussion between governments and the relevant organizations who are the experts in this field
1457427 youll represent americas love for freedom and our regard for human rights and human dignity
1457428 youll represent that to other athletes and to the people of china
1457429 i would say that im sure that come the ninth of august the day after the opening ceremony the magic of the games and the flawless organization will take over

1457452 he was definitely trying to stay low key for sure
1457453 it was just a couple of minutes he shook all of our hands
1457454 was that of all the older people in the place none of them recognized him c j recognized him and hes the youngest one
1457455 it was one of those things i never would have expected to see they were super nice
1457456 im not one to get too thrilled about things like that
1457457 what you saw in the congress this week was the war dance of the handmaidens of the oil companies
1457458 we are spending all of this time on a parliamentary tactic when nothing less is at stake than the planet the air we breathe our children breathe
1457459 we were accused of being a racist campaign and it was very painful personally and politically for a lot of people
1457460 people feel they lost the primary in some fashion due to that and so there arent a lot of people rushing to inoculate obama on that account
1457461 i wish to marry lucy love is all there is

1457472 creativity design interesting material and also for contributing to the blogging community no matter what language
1457473 master we are starting to lose ground on this fight they have come in with more than enough in number
1457474 we have some friends on their way to help us as we speak
1457475 i understand that but they are starting to get close enough to see them in the skies
1457476 please do not take this as me being strict but we must do what we can without always reporting back to me i know it is something that i encouraged but for now it is not the time
1457477 but give me a little more time and we will meet face to face
1457478 dont think because you can calm the flames that the city will not burn i will make sure there is nothing left but ashes when i am done with this planet
1457479 we have two more waves of sarakoth come in from the sector 22 and a third wave from sector 30 the think cloud line over yavin 4 might give us the cover we need to maybe turn this fight around
1457480 that sounds like a good idea we need to hold them off until help arrives but we still have too much time before that happens
1457481 alright lets move this fight to the clouds below remember to switch on your targeting computers to still be able to see them through the clouds
1457482 they dont lock on to them but it will still allow us to see through the clouds
1457483 we are already fighting this battle with our eyes this way we dont lose the only thing going for us yellow 8 you take the lead on this one we are going to need to keep you around to help take out the cruisers later on
1457484 i think one of the explosions sent shrapnel into one of my engines i cant turn or speed up and now i got six boogies on me
1457485 dont follow individual targets stay behind me on one target at a time
1457486 keep an eye out for wherever the other two are
1457487 you keep an eye on those other three while i move closer to this one
1457488 is there anything that i can even do from this seat besides watch
1457489 to your left should be a panel just place you hand there and it should reveal itself
1457490 well earlier we were trying to keep a low profile they normally only man these things with one person a piece
1457491 and just to give you head up those do not have that great of a range
1457492 well its better than me telling you that we have company
1457493 so why dont they have two to a fighter again
1457494 because they have much better speed and agility than our fighters do
1457495 so im guessing they are just being arrogant in thinking they would never be tailed by anyone
1457496 keep her steady a little bit so i can at least hit something
1457497 well at this moment i am trying to take care of the one in front of us
1457498 besides the less predictable i am to you its even more unpredictable to them
1457499 well quickly do some fun dodging otherwise theyve got us too
1457500 i wish he would just stay still for like two seconds
1457501 dont they ever get tired of using the same trick over and over
1457502 one down but we have a new one on us now
1457503 it didnt work the first time i doubt it will work this time
1457504 you said to keep an eye on the fighters not to keeping an eye out for a cruiser
1457505 besides it is so hard to see any of these guys
1457506 well get ready to go revisit one of these things because it doesnt look like we are getting away from this
1457507 there are other reasons for you not to be in this room let no one come this way the knight nods his head and runs out of the room jaina walks over to the window and looks up to the darkened sky you cant fight your own battle so you have everyone around you do it for you
1457508 michael had gone through a lot of ups and downs in his life
1457509 he didnt like no adult telling him what to do
1457510 like i said at first he wasnt a joy were just happy that we could be a part of it to make a childs life better than it was
1457511 having this good family right here whatever i need all i got to do is tell them and they give it to me
1457512 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
1457513 now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me
1457514 before our project little was known about the chemical ecology of cerambycid beetles or their use of attractant pheromones and the pheromones of only a few species had been identified
1457515 our longer term goals are to gain a better understanding of which subfamilies tribes and genera are likely to use pheromones and within those groups to determine the types of chemicals that are used as pheromones
1457516 conversely if we can predict which species do not use attractant pheromones there would be no point in looking for such compounds and we could focus on finding the chemicals that attract these species to their host trees
1457517 these morphological features and specific behaviors are reliably associated with pheromone use by cerambycid beetles
1457518 specifically for a large group of species we found males have a particular type of glandular structure to produce pheromones these males adopted a very specific stance when they were releasing their pheromones akin to doing pushups thus from simply checking for the presence of the glands or observing the behavior of a new invasive cerambycid species or both regulatory personnel can reliably predict whether a new species uses attractant pheromones that can be identified and exploited for its detection and management
1457519 this is critically important for lure design because lures must release 5 000 to 25 000 micrograms of pheromone per day to be effective
1457520 this is in marked contrast to pheromone baited traps for other insect species where release rates from the trap lures are typically a few micrograms per day we are working to develop lures for field use that are capable of these high release rates for extended periods such as weeks
1457521 importantly we discovered that this fibrosis occurs more rapidly and to a greater extent in the portion of the gut the largest lymphatic tissue in the body containing the t cells compared with other immune tissues
1457522 the fibrosis stops cells from returning to immune tissues especially in the gut
1457523 with this tool we are able to monitor individual transmission lines and place the system as a whole in the context of potential impact on population transportation and critical infrastructures
1457524 epa has established a framework and guidelines that have improved the practice of ecological risk assessment
1457525 this study presents a number of specific opportunities for making the risk assessment process even more effective
1457526 and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed
1457527 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
1457528 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1457529 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian
1457530 i took my birthday money when i turned 18 and went to the adult bookstore and bought pornography
1457531 i didnt want to change their views on things what i really wanted was something that would absolutely and precisely meet their needs its a very commercial instinct that i have
1457532 were simple creatures everything were attracted to were attracted to in the same way bright colors and the flow of shapes
1457533 his men were considered the ultimate in masculinity but theyre absolutely feminine in that theyre composed of rounded shapes their buttocks are round as melons
1457534 were attracted to round buoyant things be it a hamburger or a breast
1457535 only at the house of taschen would homoerotica sit side by side with horticulture fetish girls next to french impressionism
1457536 was going to somehow have to change my aesthetic and learn to look at pictures and see something that was arty and different than pornography
1457537 its the same thing youre looking for curves everything sexually appealing has curves
1457538 it was even more fun than i thought it was going to be
1457539 all my career in magazines was working with female imagery and i always enjoyed it but i am heterosexual and so when i started working on the big penis book i really discovered what male photographers and editors had known all along and that is there are just going to be some images that grab you that get you in a way that is not simply aesthetic
1457540 it helped to keep me going when i had to say look at 300 000 images that were all in negative form from one mans archive
1457541 it would have been easy at the beginning of the third day
1457542 there may be that wonderful one that perfect one that best one that im going to miss

1457561 second the fda should reexamine its commitment to the rigid structure of the vaccine with exactly one strain from each of three categories for example if theres agreement on choosing two of the strains and disagreement about which strain to pick for the third why not include four

1457563 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i have nothing to set before him and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened
1457564 behold the lords hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness
1457565 attending church in kentucky we watched an especially verbal and boisterous child being hurried out slung under his irate fathers arm
1457566 then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and i will be found of you saith the lord

1457568 lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity selah surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more

1457572 when i was a boy of fourteen my father was so ignorant i could hardly stand to have the old man around but when i got to be twenty one i was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years
1457573 to love someone unconditionally as i loved daddy is to remember isolated and long past moments together to remember nuances that made such an object of love unique and impossible to replace that is why i remember and cherish the memories of the mans hair his smell his likes and dislikes his speech and his idiosyncrasies we had such a little time together war took him away then he came back for a short time before he was gone again he never would return on a full time basis maybe that is why each of the nuances each of the jokes and stories each of the memories is so priceless to me i have some pictures of my father i have that packet of war records i have the flag that was across his casket i have his bronze star and his purple hearts in a frame and they hang on my wall but what i dont have anymore is him there will be no new memories made that is why i cling to those i have with such tenacity

1457578 hey horatio my man this sure is one mutha fluffin blockhouse i shonuf dig it on the outside baby but inside man i got the heebie geebies
1457579 what about those mushrooms that grow up at danglydong dell
1457580 things look kind of groovy after eating a few of those
1457581 you better believe it horatio my man did ya recognize the badge
1457582 oh man you musta seen it it kinda stood out a whole bit
1457583 so what was so special about it apart from the location that is
1457584 a high priest of the church of the painted privates and you know baby the dude only told me where i could join up im goin there right now see ya around horatio baby give my best to ya mamma
1457585 can you change the spark plug of a hardly worthit with yer teeth
1457586 these muthas aint got no idea that horatio shonuf offed the three witches last summer
1457587 you state under oath i should remind you that the accused actually helped you bring down the dragon slayer airship and thereby saved the town of chunderland from certain disaster
1457588 so what about the fact that he burnt down his aunties house
1457589 do you believe that it was a deliberate attempt to murder his auntie
1457590 had your friend zack not shoved his plasterers trowel through the stud wall of his aunties house would you consider the possibility that zack might have found some other means to cause the demise of his auntie crud
1457591 i think the questions fair it shows state of mind
1457592 well he could have put her head in the mangle
1457593 wouldnt you have placed her head in the mangle rather than burn down her house while she was out shopping i mean its obvious isnt it
1457594 im not having that blankensdorft git getting all the credit for what my horatio did
1457595 everybody knows it was horatio and his two time duplicates who saved the dragon slayer i mean its all on video tape isnt it
1457596 i couldnt believe it so ive brought it with me to prove that i wasnt dreaming
1457597 my brother professor desmond squealch invented a time machine that brought two duplicate horatios from the future the resulting merging of the time lines means that he forgot how to make a time machine and the rampaging moth had its dna altered by a time storm and reverted to its caterpillar state
1457598 certainly there was no sign of the accused there of course ill run this tape through some extremely complicated algae rhythms in our experimental bio yoghurt computer to see if i can find any sign of a plasterers trowel but im pretty certain on this preliminary evidence that zack blankensdorft wasnt there
1457599 it was when i visited the penitentiary i tripped on some cheesecake just inside the door of the waiting room i then fell into tattys lap its all on video tape too tatty took it before he left ive seen it im all covered in cheesecake and rolling about in his lap it makes me look like some sort of evil pole dancer or dairy product deviant he said that if i didnt lie in court hed send this to my school and ive never even heard of oral sex
1457600 the part about horatio giving me oral sex was accurate i mean is it likely that i would leave cheesecake just inside the door of the waiting room i mean its ridiculous isnt it scandalous absolutely unthinkable
1457601 first of all id like a cup of tea then i think we should go save brutus from the church of the painted privates
1457602 i used to be a member myself excuse the puns come on
1457603 ill tell you what were going to do nothing absolutely nothing
1457604 at least not for a couple of weeks i know prince rupert reasonably well i can get brutus out with just a careless wink of my eye but lets not hurry lets make him stew a while then when hes back to his old self again well set him free hey maybe well spend a while comparing tattoos
1457605 i even managed to change the ringtone and if i can do it anyone can it took me half a year to work out how to do it on my sony

1457624 the sad part is a lot of people wont be surprised its tragic its sad all we have to do is have one our ships hit and a bunch of americans killed and one or two news stations say it was the iranians and the countrys going to be ready to go to war theyd even be willing to call a draft to say we have to go to save israel we have to march in so we need a draft thats the worst part that i fear

1457638 we were happy to do the other project but we would of course prefer to work on a church building

1457823 its important for advertisers to be able to leverage content in multiple media not only for the cost savings it provides but also to ensure an integrated coherent campaign with similar themes and messages however its also important that advertisers dont for example just post their 30 second television spot on the web and expect it to be successful different media channels require different approaches and spot runner can advise clients the best approach for each
1457824 the spot runner production network greatly expands our ability to provide highly customized ads for both tv and the internet not only directly to businesses that want to leverage it for their own needs but also for national partners that have local affiliates that can benefit from video e g franchises iyps and social iyps resellers media and content owners etc with the production network we can quickly deploy a local filmmaker to capture on site video footage of our clients businesses such as customer testimonials employees at work product demonstrations images of their storefronts and local landmarks

1457832 well it snowed in one direction then rained from another and hail ice and wind roared through as well we just didnt know which way the weather was going to hit us it was all very complicated and very unusual
1457833 but at least we knew which direction they were coming in from not like last weekend when weather came from all sides and very complex one minute it was snowing then 30 minutes in came the rain from another direction it was very weird

1457838 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1457839 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1457842 weve had some trouble with some of the people here
1457843 the 90s led to some serious soul searching for the dallas bred austin braised musician moving to los angeles probably seemed like a good idea at the time but record labels have a way of overlooking players in their own backyard denny didnt take obscurity for an answer and decided to record his own album and let the music do the talking it worked like a charm a tone for my sins has all the guitar youll ever need to hear in fact if its not on the album its probably something you dont have to have anyway
1457844 where was the idf all these years whenever we complained of rock throwings
1457845 it appears that the idf provides selective protection now it thinks that the arabs are in danger so suddenly it begins beefing up its patrols we have been complaining for years about the dangers to jews and incidents of rock throwings and shootings against jews are many many times more numerous than the other way around yet the army often fails to help us out
1457846 whenever there is a violent incident between jews and arabs the first thing the army does when it arrives is to arrest the jews for instance in the gilad farm a few days ago arabs threw rocks the jews called the police and the next thing we knew jews were arrested
1457847 saying that the police apparently have become confused as to their mission the law says he has 35 days to respond
1457848 we have apparently returned to the days of the british mandate
1457849 when the jews had to contend with a hostile government the government has placed great restrictions on our growth and construction for instance has restricted new connections to the electricity grid frozen zoning plans and has barely done anything to stop the arabs from stealing metal and various infrastructure elements
1457850 i think olmert will try to hammer us as hard as he can its like his last gasp death throes i also think he will try to remove and destroy migron a jewish neighborhood north of jerusalem with 43 families unless the police and army tell him that this is unfeasible

1457864 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
1457865 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
1457866 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
1457867 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
1457868 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

1457911 i have to do this as mothers who give up never find their children
1457912 i never thought that something bad would happen to my child because i see nothing wrong with her being an activist helping the people who were not familiar with the laws and the benefits they should be receiving to me this constitutes helping the government but the government obviously thinks otherwise
1457913 i really need to remain active so the international community our local media even the authorities and the perpetrators know that i know where my daughter is the military is holding her and it is the militarys responsibility to help me find my daughter
1457914 there was an increase in activist killings in the areas where gen palparan was assigned

1457930 det var godt at v re l nmodtager i den seneste h jkonjunktur men af flere grunde har de danske m nd nok f et mere ud af det r dgl dende arbejdsmarked end kvinderne
1457931 vi har ogs selv tal der viser at forskellen p m nd og kvinders l n er stigende i danmark senest fra 06 til 07 hvor de nyeste data er fra hvilket ikke er s rligt overraskende for der er ikke noget i danmark der tr kker i den anden retning den udvikling er problematisk for den betyder jo at vi her og nu f r et a og et b hold p arbejdsmarkedet og senere hen store forskelle blandt pensionisterne fordi pensionen er bestemt af l nnens st rrelse
1457932 men det k nsopdelte arbejdsmarked forklarer langt fra hele uligheden for selv inden for brancherne i det private er der store forskelle p m nd og kvinders l nninger s store dele af l nforskellene er helt uforklarede

1457943 were very happy to have him and we are more an more convinced hes make a great robbie
1457944 it is a very demanding part as robbie appears in virtually every single scene in the film
1457945 for example well need tom for 6 weeks filming whereas well need emma sara paxton for only three weeks filming

1457955 the main focus of our advocacy strategy is to change policy and practice to ban all forms of violence against children and enhance awareness of child rights
1457956 the law permits the types of discipline inflicted on children by their parents and teachers as sanctioned by general custom
1457957 they repeatedly asked us to work hard to protect them from violence

1457972 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1457973 while these advances and the global nature of cybercrime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside

1457975 travis childers has continuously rewarded himself with long weekends this summer instead of delivering relief to the people of mississippi calling for a real energy solution
1457976 republicans have introduced a sensible and effective energy policy but childers is more interested in standing with his do nothing democrat leadership than backing a real solution to one of the countrys most pressing issues

1457979 the cries for help from the first district are falling on deaf ears as congressman childers refuses to support domestic offshore drilling efforts
1457980 it appears childers is more concerned with the liberal agenda of the democratic party than the needs of the first district we need someone in congress who truly represents the district unlike childers who continues to walk the party line

1457995 we dont know who started the fire but it began at 2 a m the fire isnt a miracle it didnt just start itself someone did this
1457996 last year we lost about 4 000 hectares of forest and this years forest fire season started early if this same fire occurred in october it would have been much worse due to the winds

1458032 israel recruits unifil to protect its pilots against being captured
1458033 concerned about hizbullahs acquisition of effective anti aircraft weapons that could shoot down israeli jetfighters
1458034 emphasizing the need to maintain overflights in lebanese airspace to confront the threat of hizbullah armament israel has asked all the states and their security and military agencies to upgrade unifils operational activities to confiscate such weapons
1458035 however the most important request that israel has made and was discussed by israeli and peacekeeping officers is related to practical measures by unifil to prevent the capture by hizbullah fighters of israeli crew members of warplanes that hizbullah might succeed in knocking down
1458036 in case an israeli warplane was shot down in unifils area of operations the pilot should be rescued as soon as possible and taken to the closest unifil post before any side manages to reach him
1458037 in case the pilot fell into the hands of gunmen he must also be rescued only in the case that the pilot falls into the hands of lebanese army troops there should be no intervention
1458038 media report does not accurately represent the way unifil operates
1458039 in accordance with the technical arrangements established in 2006 between unifil and the lebanese army unifil will hand over to the lebanese army any persons whom they may detain and any weapons ammunition and explosives they may seize in the course of discharging their duties under the mandate of the security council resolution 1701 2006 and in accordance with unifil rules of engagement
1458040 reports all violations and acts in a completely transparent and impartial way keeping un headquarters and the security council fully informed about any violations of resolution 1701

1458050 the united states is not our enemy without the us we will die
1458051 while there may be some who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the supermarket shelves
1458052 the source told us that there were no active weapons of mass destruction programs
1458053 the white house group that was dealing with preparation for the iraq war came back and said they were no longer interested
1458054 the policy was set the war in iraq was coming and they were looking for intelligence to fit into the policy
1458055 they certainly took information that came from single sources on the yellowcake story and on several other stories with no corroboration at all
1458056 it just sticks in my craw every time i hear them say its an intelligence failure
1458057 this was a policy failure i think over time people will look back on this and see this is going to be one of the great i think policy mistakes of all time
1458058 i cannot count how many times the president has said the intelligence was wrong
1458059 the executive branch and the congress have the best possible intelligence as they move forward to deal with the threats that face this country and face this world

1458062 pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate the chemical name for vitamin c decreased tumour volumes 41 53 per cent in diverse cancer types known for both their aggressive growth and limited treatment options
1458063 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice
1458064 pharmacologic concentrations of ascorbate decreased tumour volumes 41 53 in diverse cancer types known for both their aggressive growth and limited treatment options
1458065 a regimen of daily pharmacologic ascorbate treatment significantly decreased growth rates of ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma tumours established in mice
1458066 similar pharmacologic concentrations were readily achieved in humans given ascorbate intravenously these data suggest that ascorbate as a prodrug may have benefits in cancers with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options
1458067 this is encouraging work but its at a very early stage because it involves cells grown in the lab and mice much more research is needed before well know whether vitamin c could be a viable cancer treatment in the future
1458068 there is currently no evidence from clinical trials in humans that injecting or consuming vitamin c is an effective way to treat cancer some research even suggests that high doses of antioxidants can make cancer treatment less effective reducing the benefits of radiotherapy and chemotherapy
1458069 how to survive the crisis and prosper in the process
1458070 these concerns among analysts about the fed raising interest rates are almost comical
1458071 were in a recession and when has the fed ever raised interest rates during a recession
1458072 global stock markets are declining global bond markets are declining in price global commodities are declining in price
1458073 this is an asset deflation of significant proportions and to the extent that central banks now must prevent that deflation then interest rates dont go up they go down
1458074 our view is that we want to stay under the government umbrella
1458075 to the extent that we have an umbrella that shelters large banks and to the extent that we have an umbrella that shelters the agencies fannie and freddie then thats where you want to be
1458076 it is more of the same from the iranians obfuscation and delays
1458077 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1458078 there are not any surprises here they are trying to navigating a very tough climate in this environment the best is to do nothing they are still expecting the economy to firm in 2009
1458079 in the short term its hard to envision this scenario of a rate hike for that to happen you would need to see things improving significantly the labor market remains a wildcard at this time there are other headwinds such as tight credit conditions
1458080 you will have a dissent going forward to underscore their concerns about inflation its indicative of the open atmosphere at the federal reserve at this time
1458081 i dont think theyre saying anything new i think the oil price move lower gives them the ability to hold rates steady without sacrificing too much in terms of the dollars recent strength
1458082 i also think weakening european economy gives them room to hold steady if inflation moderates you can keep rates lower its good to keep rates lower because that helps repair the balance sheets of the u s banks
1458083 the stock market had a substantial upward move very quickly after the announcement profit taking alleviated the upward pressure and returned the benchmarks back to their pre announcement levels the fed basically is concerned about inflation and the slowing economy and apparently feels that taking no action at this time is better than making a change in monetary policy they did note that they stand ready to make a decision on interest rates if necessary
1458084 the big news for the market almost more than the fomc is oil the fed is getting a little bit of relief because oil is below 120 a barrel and commodity prices are coming down you cant get away from what caused the recession which is the weaker consumer who has been battered by rising prices at the grocery store and at the gas pump and facing a weaker employment picture the consumer is hurting and consumer demand drives 70 percent of gdp
1458085 the fed needs to avoid the risks japan faced in the early 1990s so i wanted to see that it had maximized flexibility in all three areas growth inflation and credit by referring to all three things it emphasized that it remains flexible i would contrast this with the ecbs recent statements the decision not to raise rates was the correct one and it has given itself room to act according to what needed the stock market may be encouraged a bit by the fact that there was only one dissent
1458086 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1458087 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1458088 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
1458089 to keep inflation expectations anchored means that monetary policy makers will have to back up their words with actions
1458090 we will need to reverse course i anticipate the reversal will need to be started sooner rather than later
1458091 we cant wait until we clearly observe the financial markets at normal the economy growing robustly and so on and so forth our actions will affect the economy in the future not at the moment forecasts play a critical role
1458092 were pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1458093 it will be important for the federal reserve to monitor inflation developments and inflation expectations closely and to move to a less accommodative stance in a timely fashion
1458094 when to begin this process and how fast to move will be difficult decisions
1458095 while a 2 percent federal funds rate may be appropriate in a period of extreme economic weakness if maintained for too long it could allow inflationary pressures to build over time
1458096 i couldnt agree with you more that inflation is a tax and that inflation currently is too high and its a top priority of the federal reserve to run a policy thats going to bring inflation to an acceptable level
1458097 the housing market is really the central element of this financial crisis and anything we can do to strengthen the housing market to strengthen mortgage finance would be beneficial
1458098 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth at the same time upside risks to inflation outlook have intensified lately
1458099 many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress in part because the outlook for the economy and thus for credit quality remains uncertain helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority
1458100 i think were looking at the remainder of the year being probably positive growth but certainty not robust growth
1458101 i am somewhat reassured by the recent data which suggest that my biggest fears on the downside have so far been avoided however a few months of data dont make a trend
1458102 we are currently monitoring developments in financial markets closely and considering several options including extending the duration of our facilities for primary dealers beyond year end should the current unusual and exigent circumstances continue to prevail in dealer funding markets
1458103 it could happen that we find it necessary to raise rates even if unemployment is still rising and growth is still weak
1458104 that is a possibility it is something that we need to be prepared to do
1458105 on a continuum i would say things are shifting to somewhat more inflation risks
1458106 the risks to inflation are likely not symmetric and they have definitely increased we cannot and will not allow a wage price spiral to develop
1458107 it is hurting fed credibility to say that we are trying to keep inflation low and stable but at the same time we are not counting some of the prices that are going up at the most rapid pace
1458108 i have a food processor you can have its been out in the garage waiting to be taken to goodwill because i already have another food processor my mother in law bought this one for me and i dont want it so youre welcome to it if youd like it i can bring it to you tonight

1458115 emphasizing that the sate is the sole authority is the guiding principle of the policy statement
1458116 could have also included internal security forces isf and other political parties such as the phalange and the lf to defend their country
1458117 the right to liberate and defend lebanon was not given to a single faction
1458118 does not even grant the lebanese army the sole right to decide on the defense strategy or the decision on war and peace against israel

1458142 all through the syrian occupation the free patriotic movement managed to sustain a relationship between comrades inside and outside of lebanon
1458143 we have a duty to let lebanese emigrants vote it is not enough to say we should we must actually do it

1458147 from the very beginning for feminists it was all about taking the woman out of the network of social and family relationships and isolating her as an independent person
1458148 the pope is all about celebrating our dependence upon others as being a representation of our dependence upon god its in showing the world how we receive the love of god that we become truly feminine
1458149 as a young single woman in the church one is given these various messages as to how to be feminine
1458150 what the pope showed me in mulieris dignitatem is how to be authentically myself in social situations and that i dont need to try to fit anyones ideal i just need to live out the graces that god has given me in a unique way as a woman and that by living virtuously i will become feminine without effort

1458159 posipeople is more than just good news it is a place where i can read and learn about best in class solutions to some of societys most challenging problems public charities spent nearly 1 trillion dollars in 2007 solving these challenges and the mainstream media is almost completely oblivious to the enormous impact that many of these charities are having many of these entrepreneurs are so absorbed in their work to improve others lives that they dont have time nor want to promote themselves people who enjoy and are good at promoting these entrepreneurs now have a venue to do so and the general public now has a one stop location where they can get real content and commentary about sincere smart people making real impact
1458160 i like to read about the people out there who have inspirational stories to tell and who do great things to care for the environment and others posipeople gathers all of these stories and it is the one place i visit often for the upbeat kind of content that i think the internet needs more of

1458171 originally legislation was looking like it was going to be targeted at casual sellers
1458172 the aggregate amount of sales reported to the irs isnt going to match the individual sellers tax returns

1458178 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and john oates emeritus professor of primatology at hunter college in new york oates said that while the news was good for the iconic great apes made famous by
1458179 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1458180 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction
1458181 in malaysia sumatra and borneo the big problem is destruction of forests to make way for palm oil and biofuels ironically with biofuels something that is nominally associated with helping the environment can have harmful unintentional consequences
1458182 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1458183 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1458184 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1458185 having said that this the remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1458186 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in there may be other populations
1458187 there is not any cause that requires all that separation between arab states
1458188 lebanon which is nourished by the regions problems may contribute to easing those problems if it can reach an internal accord founded on strong political bases
1458189 are those political lines that are related to international coalitions and that do their best to prevent this arab state from reaching agreement with that state exactly as they have worked to prevent the lebanese from cooperating on the level of common political titles
1458190 lebanon could overcome the political crisis it went through and the government should now serve the lebanese people and put the social and living affairs on top of its interests
1458191 constitutes a consecration of the authority of the state and its institutions to impose their power over the entire lebanese territory
1458192 ministerial solidarity is essential for the government to overcome future challenges primarily the handling of social living and economic conditions and the reduction of taxes
1458193 the lebanese are also called to promote the role of the state in spreading its authority and to deal with it with responsibility and high ethics in order for it to provide the country and its people with security peace and tranquility

1458207 every information processing revolution is associated with a new technology the computer the book the brain dna these technologies allow information to be registered and processed according to a set of rules
1458208 if you have an infinite number of alternatives then you have an infinite amount of information

1458210 for computers ambiguity is a bug the ambiguity of human language is not a bug its a bonus
1458211 in fact it is just when we behave rationally moving logically like a computer from step to step that our behavior becomes provably un predictable rationality combines with self reference to make our actions intrinsically paradoxical and uncertain computers certainly possess the ability to reason and the capacity for self reference and just because they do their actions are intrinsically inscrutable
1458212 in the story of universe told in this book the primary actor in the physical history is information ultimately information and energy play complementary roles in the universe energy makes physical systems do things information tells them what to do
1458213 entropy is the information contained in a physical system that is invisible to us
1458214 free energy is energy in a highly ordered form associated with a relatively low amount of entropy the relatively small amount of information required to describe this energy makes it available for us thats why its called free
1458215 its clear that energy and information visible and invisible are the two primary actors in the universal drama energy is conserved information never decreases to do anything requires energy to specify what is done requires information energy and information are by nature no pun intended intertwined

1458229 our hope is to continue growth i think the county has experienced over time continued growth and ridership just in general and part of that is the gasoline and fuel issue the other part is that its just a great service for the county

1458239 the right of lebanons people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied shebaa farms kfar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and to defend the country using all legal and possible means
1458240 hizbullah has the advantage its the strongest on the ground vis a vis israel and the south
1458241 it is one step in the states favor in lebanons favor
1458242 its obvious that hizbullah got an important achievement because of its recognition of resistance
1458243 we all know that this government is going to be less than a year
1458244 this wording is more time buying until the next government
1458245 hizbullah wanted to feel secure to run its election campaign
1458246 it got what it wanted and everyone won it will devote all of its energy to the election campaign
1458247 the different protagonists want to keep their constituencies mobilized while they are going into a process of government together
1458248 we are going toward elections and they dont want people to be demobilized thats why they are trying to give the impression to people that things are still under negotiation
1458249 its very natural that each protagonist tries to give the impression of being strong and not giving any concessions
1458250 march 14 will continue to use that as a slogan before the polls and during the polls its a good slogan
1458251 for march 14 undoubtedly they will try to postpone the elections
1458252 its not in their interests to have elections in 10 months
1458253 hizbullahs arms still have a regional role they want leeway some margin to act with some kind of liberty in case something happens in the region they wanted some freedom of action waiting for the fallout in the region
1458254 since we are seeing syria and iran going to a peace process with the west an entente there is no atmosphere of war anymore in the country
1458255 hizbullah is embarrassed hizbullah is seeing the process of negotiations between israel and syria

1458259 while northstar might be facing financial difficulties comparable to other banking institutions this does not provide it with carte blanche to breach its contractual obligations

1458364 the backlash is one thing youre always going to have commentary i get backlash when i vote a girl off of americas next top model you know ive got people that are angry with me but this is very important these animals have no one i saw this with my own eyes i was there and i watched what was going on and quite frankly all those young men that have seen this its extraordinarily dehumanizing their job is go out to a small animal and whack it over the head with a club and quite frankly i think im doing them a favor
1458365 a lot of people cant do it because its hard visually seeing it and im a young guy hes older than me and its just different you can only be out there for like five hours at a time its brutal

1458369 i think they should have the girls make their own clothes they should totally do the runway and they have to put together the whole show by themselves like you know do everything with like stage set up everything
1458370 i just think it couldve been a little more innovative i actually think that some of the pieces were really creative but last nights challenge i thought the clothes were horrific i think the talent level isnt close to some of the talent and designs we had on my season
1458371 i cant listen to somebody say licious all day long to get it popular its not funny to me i really just cant hear that

1458388 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
1458389 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1458390 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1458391 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1458392 dont trust what youre told even in the face of mountains of evidence
1458393 trust without any evidence what so ever something that someone told you about that seems to meet your perception that were standing on a flat surface not a curved one
1458394 you only need to find love and love is hiding in the rose bush
1458395 you cannot repair my eyes but if you want to do something for me you can be my guide
1458396 every statistic shows that children grow up more likely to do well in school stay out of trouble and have a happier life if they have both a male and female role model
1458397 too often we look at these things from the point of view of the adult rather than the child i think that adoption by homosexual couples is unsatisfactory for the child

1458415 transfers made pursuant to a chapter 11 plan that has been confirmed
1458416 the issuance transfer or exchange of a security or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under the bankruptcy code may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax
1458417 use sell or lease other than in the ordinary course of business property of the estate
1458418 we cannot say that a transfer made prior to the date of plan confirmation could be subordinate to or authorized by something that did not exist at the date of transfer a plan confirmed by the court
1458419 authorizes any transfer that is necessary to the confirmation of the plan
1458420 irrespective of whether the transfer involved the debtor or property of the estate
1458421 t his court has yet to squarely address whether the section 1146 tax exemption may apply to pre confirmation transfers
1458422 not to the timing of the transfers but to the necessity of the transfers to the consummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization
1458423 but omits it in another section of the same act
1458424 it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion
1458425 the strict temporal construction of section 1146 articulated by the third and fourth circuits ignores the practical realities of chapter 11 reorganization cases
1458426 will not qualify for the tax exemption unless they occur after the order confirming the plan is entered
1458427 may apply to those pre confirmation transfers that are necessary to the consummation of a confirmed plan of reorganization which at the very least requires that there be some nexus between the pre confirmation sale and the confirmed plan
1458428 while both sides present credible interpretations of 1146 a fdor has the better one
1458429 places greater strain on the statutory text than the simpler construction advanced by fdor and adopted by the third and fourth circuits
1458430 because the phrase under a plan confirmed is most naturally read to require that there be a confirmed plan at the time of the transfer
1458431 whether a actions are consistent with a legal instrument that does not exist and indeed may not even be conceived of at the time of the sale
1458432 we find nothing justifying such a curious interpretation of what is a straightforward exemption
1458433 falls well short of the mark because reading 1146 a in the manner piccadilly proposes would require us to do exactly what the canon counsels against
1458434 chapter 11 strikes a balance between a debtors interest in reorganizing and restructuring its debts and the creditors interest in maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate
1458435 w e therefore decline to construe the exemption granted by 1146 a to the detriment of the state
1458436 w e see no absurdity in reading 1146 a as setting forth a simple bright line rule instead of the complex after the fact inquiry piccadilly envisions
1458437 it is incumbent upon the legislature and not the judiciary to determine whether 1146 a is in need of revision
1458438 i t makes no difference whether a transfer takes place before or after the plan is confirmed
1458439 in both instances the confirmation of the related plan assures the legitimacy from bankruptcy laws perspective of the plan that provides for the assets transfer
1458440 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1458441 we will work closely with all regulatory agencies involved to improve testing protocols and to ensure that the lines of communication remain open in order to continue to protect the public health

1458564 i have a lot of respect for anyone who makes gears
1458565 as much as any of our other efforts the quality of our gear making defines the quality of our final product
1458566 this companys success has been built on attention to detail not just being detail oriented but having the observational talents to see and understand whats wrong and then having the know how to make it right that is the single bona fide secret to producing perfect gears
1458567 gene wasnt completely happy with the gears we were getting from vendors so he purchased a reishauer rz 80 and started making the gears himself he did a lot of experimenting and testing to figure out exactly what was going on he not only solved all of the performance problems but he learned how to repair and maintain the machine himself then he taught us
1458568 were making essentially the gears that gene evolved along with 70 or 80 other kinds of gears were still doing everything in house and were still solving all of our problems ourselves
1458569 until recently nobody had equipment to make them precise machinists were often happy if they just fit together if you open a machinerys handbook to the section on spur gears youll find a lot of tables for backlash and things those tables werent based on a desire to make a bad gear
1458570 its just that when those tables were written back around world war ii that was the state of the art cnc gear hobbers and grinders obviously didnt exist then you just couldnt expect to hold 30 millionths of an inch on a grind but now we have equipment and processes that can hold down in those ranges repeatedly we can literally produce an oil film fit we manufacture smoother running gears than anyone could even have imagined back then
1458571 quite simply it allows us to precisely control the outcome there are so many little tricks and subtleties in the hobbing and finish grinding that we just would not succeed by having them done externally we build our own gears to get exactly the right thing for us at the highest precision possible
1458572 but when you make a gear in house you can build things into it that they cant do across the street for example you can preassemble the gears in a rough state on a single mandrel put them into a hobber or a grinder and finish grind them perfectly the gears are as exact as you can measure them and theyre already on the shaft theyll run on across the street is just not close enough to ensure this kind of quality
1458573 for a manufacturing environment thats the ideal we can make the gears in very tight batches of 10 or 20 and quickly process them through its more costeffective than ordering big batches and if there are any issues were only looking at a small number of reworks to get production flowing again thats if there are any issues
1458574 honestly weve not had one since we adopted this approach
1458575 the aluminum bronze worm gears at the heart of our rotary products are actually quite mature concepts
1458576 the inherent accuracy is assured by the singlelead hobbers that we use and by the preassembly we do before cutting we place the shrink fit gear blank onto the spindle mount it on the fixture and actually tram it in the guys boris and edik try to shoot for a runout of about 50 millionths
1458577 every third or fifth one is checked on the klingelnberg gear analyzer against a master worm
1458578 we can verify tooth to tooth and overall pitch accuracies on both the worm and the gear at the same time we also have special worms that we use to check the gears as were cutting them for more immediate feedback we need to know that theyre coming out of the machines right
1458579 you cant compete at the level just described without having some of the best equipment in the world like the reishauer rz 362a hobber the studer s40 grinders and the exceptional inspection equipment we have on the floor you have to have the best tools to generate these results repeatedly
1458580 we also have new mitsubishi gc15 and gc40 gear hobbers
1458581 as well as high quality carbide hobs and a real passion for maintaining the equipment so that it stays accurate
1458582 and it simply could not be done if the gear was jobbed out in a nutshell we keep tabs on everything we know where were going and how to get there
1458583 we have an assembly staff that can inspect as they build since the parts are made in a controlled process and the assembly staff knows all aspects of it including the tolerance bands for testing the parts we have complete control of the quality
1458584 this level of skill and experience is the final key to the success of the process
1458585 the process of serious negotiations with the ioc and improving relations
1458586 mind sports by their nature cannot be part of the program
1458587 in the ancient olympic games the element of cultural and mental activity was present
1458588 in the olympic games until the second world war there were competitions that rewarded the mental efforts of people in the same manner they rewarded physical efforts
1458589 today the missing element of the intellectual competition can be re introduced by the involvement of chess and perhaps bridge
1458590 we think bridge is a sport it requires stamina brain power and concentration bridge is a sport just like baseball and football it requires training and strenuous exercise it is more than just a game
1458591 show to the world that these games require effort competence and determination just like any other sport
1458592 can bring joy happiness and spectacle to the participants and to the audience

1458608 it was all very new to us but somehow we had to learn how to get the most from it fast
1458609 we were able to offer them a product 20 percent cheaper than their previous supplier
1458610 suddenly the hard work and investment began to pay off
1458611 we knew we had to start looking at high speed cnc machining centres
1458612 at first we only looked at various japanese german and swiss models the ones we had heard of but the quotes were very expensive we thought that must be the going rate but then we came across haas
1458613 we needed to prove that the haas machines could produce a die within the cycle times and quality requirements we expected
1458614 at that time we wanted to machine a connecting rod die from h13 tool steel 50hrc so we passed the challenge to haas the result was really impressive in fact the results were no different than a set of benchmarking tests we had done on a japanese machine that cost several times the price
1458615 we work the haas machines very hard 24 hours a day seven days a week
1458616 temperatures in the factory often can exceed 40 c 104 f but none of our machines cope as well as the haas machines
1458617 we are immensely pleased with the performance of our haas machines
1458618 before they were installed the cycle time for a typical crankshaft die was 40 to 50 hours now it is 14 to 15 hours similarly a die for a connecting rod previously was machined in 40 hours whereas now it takes just four add to this the fact that there is no bench or polishing work no tool marks or cracks and it is easy to see why we are so pleased the days of separate roughing and finishing are also behind us all of our dies are now machined complete in a single setup on a single machine

1458659 heres pictures of the plates that capture the bearing in a ring of seven bolts that had to be very precise and a cnc mill at low rpm drilled the 1 4 inch steel plates and milled out the large holes for the bearings race to rest against while leaving the rest of the bearing exposed the red rubber rings are the hand made dust seals that keep the grease in the bearings as well the math had to be exact for the bolts to rest against the bearings outer race and hold it in place too tight it wont go together too loose and dangerous slipping about of the bearing could result and shatter the race i was amazed at how perfectly the cnc machine created this part a professional machinest loaned his time to the project for this item

1458723 and no one is advocating a return to the halcyon days of
1458724 over the years the parents television council has released numerous studies aimed at influencing lawmakers and regulators to believe that parents arent competent enough to make television viewing decisions for their own families
1458725 this newest study follows previous formulas perfectly another study with a scary title that uses faulty analysis biased methodology and suspect omissions to influence the debate and raise money
1458726 if you look at some of the examples the anti marriage bias is so comical
1458727 there the non marital relationships tended to be portrayed positively
1458728 that was warm loving marital relations we had last night

1458740 he says he doesnt understand why im still seeing you since were not boyfriends after two months
1458741 actually a lot of them dont really get it they think were some casual on and off thing
1458742 there would be a lot of single guys they wanted me to go have fun with them and basically get laid
1458743 weve been together for a long time weve been getting more serious and taking our time with the whole boyfriend thing why dont they approve
1458744 i have no idea one of the things i like about you the most is how thoughtful you are how you really think things through i really like the fact you dont just call everyone a boyfriend that youre actually making sure theres something there they dont get the fact that were pretty serious about each other
1458745 i mean really what would be different if i started calling you my boyfriend
1458746 ill still feel the same way for you that i do now well still be the same people except for some stupid label that somehow would prove to your friends that were a legit couple

1458756 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1458757 what was given to solana was the telephone conversation transcript and not a response to the proposed package
1458758 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1458759 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1458760 shutting down the straits and closing off the persian gulf would be a sort of a self defeating exercise

1458767 iran the us government will again need to keep an eye on the long term communicating with the current government but also encouraging more discussion among iranians and more contacts and interactions between iranians and americans
1458768 societies and governments change the us government has some ability to foster favorable trends in iran but these policies will take time to come to fruition
1458769 appears to be on its way to becoming a nuclear power
1458770 a large majority of iranians strongly believe that iran has the same right as other nations to develop nuclear energy including the construction and operation of nuclear enrichment facilities
1458771 if irans facilities were to be bombed public support for any retaliation its government took would likely be widespread
1458772 strong push to retaliate as c ritics of such a policy would likely choose to keep silent
1458773 to finance the reconstruction of the facility and continue the current program without major budgetary consequences
1458774 probably do more to solidify public support for the regime than weaken it
1458775 iranian security forces have convincingly shown that they can handle restive ethnic groups and violent opposition to iranian rule is more likely to entrench the current security and political forces than to elicit a positive change in regime policies
1458776 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1458777 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1458778 those who miss the operations in the gaza strip dont worry they will come

1458787 there were four palestinians who were issued visas about whom we then received additional information
1458788 we decided that we needed to take a closer and harder look at them in light of the additional information we received
1458789 they gave us the visas on july 30 and two days later we were told the visas were not valid
1458790 it was a great shock we had hoped to complete our studies especially after we were granted the visas we were packing our bags

1458811 the live shows will try to draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago
1458812 a person of interest is not an official designation it is abused law enforcement is politics those in power use the term to assure the public that theyre doing something police authorities fear admitting that they literally have no clue who committed a crime
1458813 unfortunately these politicians trash lives along the way the person of interest is someone against whom there is no real evidence but someone who can be at least for a time used vilified scapegoated its time our law enforcement politicians learn to say no comment and for them to educate the public that very often especially at the beginning of a case police have no idea who the perpetrator was or at least no real evidence the public should want responsible action and restraint not simply action the media should also cease its complicity in this charade and rigorously question politicians who finger someone as a person of interest asking what evidence the police have to support their grave allegation otherwise naming someone a person of interest cheaply serves many of the same cynical purposes that show trials serve in totalitarian regimes
1458814 the person of interest phenomenon is something like the opposite side of the coin from terrorist watch lists in the name of improving public safety government authorities want to create some status for suspicious seeming individuals that would enlarge governments investigative power without triggering the civil liberties protections that go with identifying anyone as an actual criminal suspect so far it is not at all clear how much safety the public is getting out of the shift to a preventive law enforcement mentality there is a substantial risk that we will wind up less free but actually no safer

1458818 the upa has been incompetent in defending the ban on simi this reflects the real face of the government and its soft attitude towards terrorism
1458819 simi is terrorism and terrorism is simi the government is shying away from the fact and endangering the civil society by its soft approach to terror
1458820 the home ministry has completely failed to convince the judiciary of simis role in the vicious terror circle faced by the country the prime minister should sack such a home minister who does not deserve to be at the place and the responsibility which he holds
1458821 in such pressing times of terror attack across the country the ban has been lifted on an organisation that was banned three times earlier this is complete failure of the government
1458822 the government needs to make it known to the people the reason why it is mum and indifferent on the issue of safety of its citizens
1458823 insiders built up short positions in rpl futures at high prices and in massive quantities totaling more than 10 crore shares because of these sales the price of rpl fell from the high of rs 295 on november 01 to levels of around rs 210

1458830 thr e w all of his opponents off the ballot on a technicality so that those voters have no choice but to elect him this is precisely how he first won his state senate seat in 1996
1458831 some of the problems include printing registered voters name sic instead of writing a female voter got married after she registered to vote and signed her maiden name registered voters signed the petitions but dont live in the 13th district
1458832 why say youre for a new tomorrow then do old style chicago politics to remove legitimate candidates

1458840 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1458841 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1458842 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1458843 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1458844 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1458845 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1458846 if verified the discovery of these new populations of gorilla are hugely significant for our work as conservationists but we must not be distracted from the very real and present danger these gorillas are in from man and ebola
1458847 there is a danger that we concentrate on the more famous species
1458848 what about the other species that weve identified as in danger there are so many that are on the brink of extinction

1458850 in 1980 the population density of macaques was as much as 300 individuals per square kilometer in 10 years this had decreased to between 60 to 20 individuals per square kilometer
1458851 imagine the human population of the world reduced to that of one small town thats what we are talking about here
1458852 the habitats in which they live are largely impenetrable and we constantly find new species
1458853 having said that this the western lowland gorillas remains a unique find i dont know if well ever find something on this scale again
1458854 i think the lesson for conservationists today is that yes the world is full of surprises theres a lot of uncharted territory there in central africa there may be other populations
1458855 were talking about the congo basin rainforest here it is vast it is huge its second only to the amazon and its impenetrable

1458864 the discovery of a potential new antibiotic is an exciting advance it could mean a possible novel treatment for people with chronic wounds that are infected with mrsa or other bugs by developing the pure antibiotic into a formula such as a cream it could reduce the contact patients need to have with live maggots to heal wounds it could also offer a potential treatment such as an injection or pill for internal infections like c difficile
1458865 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1458866 maggots are great little multi taskers they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing

1458881 we thought the stuff would be legal by now and look at it people getting busted for it and seeing time like they did in the 1950s that utopia we dreamed about and threw rocks at the cops for sure took a nosedive instead we have a brave new world drug scene where doctors pass out pills whose sole role is to homogenize our emotions and our essential beings

1459197 an unapologetically narcissistic self sexualised diva who revels in her earthiness
1459198 age may have prompted her to prove there is a person underneath all that hair behind all that decolletage but its a crowded genre and
1459199 it will be a great opportunity to see how a major film gets put together in the united states
1459200 i think anybody who sees the jackets thats all they can talk about
1459201 i mean people are talking about sequels to the movie and so on
1459202 when people pass you they kind of look and point and tap their buddy on the shoulder if you stop theyll ask you if its a joke or if its for real
1459203 so i think once we get out there and start competing and get some publicity itll be really exciting
1459204 yeah its a great training place ive gone to chile but i like it down here better
1459205 some days you look up at her photo and you have to take a big swallow

1459207 thieves are known to cut open hot water cylinders and remove copper lining which in turn causes water damage to properties
1459208 were all supposed to keep records of what we buy and who from at the end of the day it comes back on us as an industry
1459209 ive had customers in here who have been going to other scrap metal yards for years without ever having had their details recorded
1459210 it was scary the back hatch of the van was open and my daughter was still under it and it came down on the back of the vehicle we thought it was a fairly sheltered site
1459211 i personally dont think im liable when a tree falls on me
1459212 i dont like the fact that im out of pocket through no fault of my own when these companies have insurance to cover this kind of thing
1459213 the van is in their care while they have the hire and anything that occurs during that hire is their responsibility
1459214 its a miracle really i dont think weve got our heads round it yet
1459215 i didnt think this day would come and i definitely couldnt have hoped it would be this soon its only been two months
1459216 what theyve done for theo is amazing i cant wait to get him home to sleep in his own bed and to live a normal life with him

1459218 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand
1459219 republicans in america need to cut out their nonsense and start agreeing with us enlightened democrats and europeans so as not to create so much division
1459220 look at berlin where a wall came down a continent came together and history proved there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
1459221 there are some who say in europe and elsewhere we can work with the communists let them come to berlin
1459222 as for what you see here the time will come when not one stone will be left on another every one of them will be thrown down
1459223 when will these things happen and what will be the sign that they are about to take place
1459224 watch out that you are not deceived for many will come in my name claiming i am he and the time is near do not follow them 9 when you hear of wars and revolutions do not be frightened these things must happen first but the end will not come right away
1459225 but before all this they will lay hands on you and persecute you they will deliver you to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors and all on account of my name
1459226 when you see jerusalem being surrounded by armies you will know that its desolation is near
1459227 there will be signs in the sun moon and stars on the earth nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea 26 men will faint from terror apprehensive of what is coming on the world for the heavenly bodies will be shaken 27 at that time they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory 28 when these things begin to take place stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing near
1459228 be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap 35 for it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth 36 be always on the watch and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the son of man
1459229 they will see the son of man coming in power and great glory

1459234 is a techno geeky way to say flexible glitch free audio
1459235 the redesigned pulseaudio automatically adjusts the way it feeds audio data to accommodate system load and ensure the audio data is always ready when needed
1459236 somewhat one size fits all design that was not nearly as flexible

1459240 theyre a continuation of our efforts in security but theyre also a reflection of a changing threat environment
1459241 customers are always asking whats the most important thing to get done when we release security updates
1459242 the new exploitability index helps with that problem were going to give predictions on how exploitable each issue is
1459243 its another piece of information another piece to the puzzle
1459244 i think its usefulness will depend on the implementation and how accurate the predictions are but it should help emphasize the need to look at exploitability as one of the factors in deciding what to patch
1459245 mapp will give the protection providers a head start and should shorten the time between our updates and their protection we recognize that its a race
1459246 i dont have to tell you that this takes some people at microsoft outside their comfort level
1459247 but the problems in security today are so large that no one vendor can deliver a solution by themselves were pushing the envelope here
1459248 well do the reverse engineering in many cases that will id where the vulnerability is
1459249 you have to give them credit that theyre putting effort into the security process
1459250 its not a silver bullet to the problem but more information is always better both of these are kind of interesting and show that microsoft is being more proactive in the security space
1459251 i have spent a lot of time looking at other major events around the world what stands out to me is the success australia has had with major events
1459252 what australia has managed to do is build their international profile build international respect build up their own capabilities in all sorts of areas i know this because i get an e mail about every second week from an australian telling me how good he is at major events and how i need to hire him
1459253 now it looks like that could be still be another couple of months off
1459254 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1459255 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm

1459265 they slightly downgraded their 2008 tyre outlook but expectations for the rest of the year were so far worse that the market quite liked what they said

1459275 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1459276 i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1459277 this is exactly what we need in michigan a focus on retooling the auto industry and manufacturing for advanced manufacturing new vehicles battery technology research its all things we are actually working on
1459278 energy is certainly a priority but you know weve been filibustered now we democrats about 80 times
1459279 we had an energy bill where we simply wanted to renew the existing energy credits on solar and wind just the existing credits which run out in december would be renewed thats been filibustered by the republicans so unless we can break some of these filibusters were going to have great difficulty in the three weeks we have in session in september to get anything done the key is will the republicans let us get a vote on some of these key issues we need to get as close to 60 votes as we can after the november elections to break the logjam
1459280 i am very impressed with the message and i feel it has some substance it gives us hope that there is an agenda in a way that we can deal with our dependence on foreign oil and its an energy plan that makes sense to me
1459281 i like the emphasis on taking care of the environment putting people back to work and changing the way we have done business in the past i think michigan is really the biggest recipient of it weve really thought for a while we were sort of falling behind the curve in terms of alternative energy and when the governor proposed 10 percent of all energy to be produced by alternative fuel sources like solar or wind power which he obama recited as well as being a great target for us to hit we thought we were losing jobs and money into michigan by taking advantage of building these wind turbines and factories that are now empty that have the facilities to actually be manufacturing again and i think when we look at it that way and sort of force the energy companies into looking at alternative ways of producing power because we all want our power lets face it then we can turn that into a job producer obviously the old way is not creating jobs for us
1459282 i wanted an opportunity to hear his whole speech and hear him talk for a half hour or so and just see what he is like
1459283 i really like sen obamas response to criticism he is setting a new high standard when it comes to the normal venomous partisan political criticism that candidates toss back and forth at each other hes responding i think in a very good way in a very statesmanlike way and thats one of the things that brought me up here today
1459284 imagine having a president who can talk about this who knows who is at the cutting edge of the green revolution who is committed to it instead of the oil industry this shows you the difference eight years of oil people running the place and now a guy who believes in a brighter future in alternative energy and really making it work for the environment and the economy all in one this is a wonderful thing for lansing for michigan for this country i am very excited about it and excited he chose lansing to unveil it

1459291 solving the central economic puzzle of money prices and jobs
1459292 how much money would a government need to function in a free market economy
1459293 the whole point of free markets is to keep reducing prices so that more and more people can afford to buy
1459294 the increase in the money supply lowers the monetary rate of interest investment then increases because business loans are available at lower interest rates projects that were formerly unprofitable are now feasible
1459295 quite the contrary interest reflects time preference the rate at which people prefer present goods to future goods
1459296 the whole point of free markets is to keep reducing prices so that more and more people can afford

1459378 were very interested in where he was coming from and what he had been doing and whether he was under the influence of anything
1459379 and that would obviously have affected his reaction time and whether he could have avoided striking alexis vehicle in the first place

1459440 eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major u s retailers and the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit card numbers have been charged with numerous crimes including conspiracy computer intrusion fraud and identity theft attorney general michael b mukasey u s attorney for the district of massachusetts michael j sullivan u s attorney for the southern district of california karen p hewitt u s attorney for the eastern district of new york benton j campbell and u s secret service director mark sullivan announced today the scheme is believed to constitute the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the department of justice
1459441 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1459442 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1459443 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1459444 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute hacker organizations wherever based and however sophisticated the united states attorneys office for the southern district of california is especially gratified that the work of the san diego field office of the secret service contributed to an unprecedented effort to dismantle this international criminal enterprise
1459445 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1459446 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1459447 technology has forever changed the way commerce is conducted virtually erasing geographic boundaries
1459448 while these advances and the global nature of cyber crime continue to have a profound impact on our financial crimes investigations this case demonstrates how combining law enforcement resources throughout the world sends a strong message to criminals that they will be pursued and prosecuted no matter where they reside
1459449 the internal revenue service criminal investigation division recommends charges in numerous types of financial crimes
1459450 todays indictment is the result of a strong law enforcement partnership that brings together the necessary skills to follow alleged criminal activity from cyberspace to bank accounts we are committed to the governments efforts to stop this type of corruptive activity

1459467 when you have two of your key players looking the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1459468 it was decided by the leadership group that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1459469 its something that we addressed do these players deserve to be part of the collingwood football club
1459470 we dont have any resolution on that and its something which will be evaluated at the end of the year
1459471 we supported the players to the hilt they panicked but they have to be shown their actions were unacceptable
1459472 i would have thought all the players would be there just focused on trying to make the four
1459473 i dont accept that at all but i do accept that people will be looking at the collingwood football club asking questions
1459474 unfortunately we are focusing on two players who have made really poor decisions that have affected their behaviour and which i think they will regret for the rest of their lives
1459475 the vast majority of players do the right thing and clubs and their player leadership groups are taking responsibility for the individual actions of players
1459476 weak kneed wimpy moderates who believe in nothing and are afraid to throw a punch
1459477 i was referring to the past slew of candidates who have lost by 9 or 10 points
1459478 so far what ive seen is a far better group of candidates than the republicans have put up in quite some time all of which have no ties to the establishment at this point
1459479 i like chris a lot but when he originally ran against dorsey one of the things he was basing his campaign on was he was anti gun and pro choice
1459480 he always claimed to be a conservative thereafter i think he uses that word quite often and i have no reason to doubt it
1459481 from what ive heard from people who know him is that hes an establishment candidate pro choice moderate tough on crime and ethics
1459482 i wouldnt put him in the former jersey city mayor bret schundler steve lonegan category id put him more in the dick zimmer leonard lance category
1459483 its premature to talk about this because chris has not made up his mind
1459484 but having said that he would make an outstanding candidate and he would appeal to all kinds of new jerseyans including the conservative base of the republican party
1459485 chris is pro life chris is a fiscal conservative democrats in new jersey gave special projects a bad name and its frankly in large measure because of the work of the us attorney that there were no christmas tree items in the budget this year

1459493 in 2001 a nafta dispute settlement panel unanimously ruled that the blanket exclusion of mexican trucking firms violated u s obligations under the nafta
1459494 the ruling gave mexico the right to retaliate against u s products entering mexico it is estimated mexican retaliation against u s products could be as much as 2 billion per year fortunately mexico refrained from retaliation however if the pilot trucking program is blocked we expect mexico to exercise its right to retaliate retaliation of this magnitude could wipe out a broad swath of u s exports to mexico and related u s jobs
1459495 dot has consistently bent over backwards to force this program on the public
1459496 they seem oblivious to the inherent safety and security risks of what they are trying to do
1459497 now just days after the committee on transportation and infrastructure approved a bipartisan bill to hold the dot to its original plan and terminate this pilot program after one year the federal motor carrier safety administration announces its intent to extend this program for two more years
1459498 when congress reconvenes in september i intend to have the full house of representatives approve our bill as quickly as possible and make certain that the voice of congress is heard loud and clear at the department of transportation and that this program is finally shut down

1459614 i feel great about making it to the final 3 but im worried
1459615 im not going to sit here and lie and say oh yeah ive known who its been all along i havent i havent had a clue if its craig nicole knows if its nicole craig knows i dont think either one of them is targeting me
1459616 mark could definitely be the mole hes on the top of my list
1459617 but im still not positive who the mole is and that is terrifying at this point in the game
1459618 i dont think that were going to be able to accomplish this mission
1459619 the game is more about the quizzes than it is the missions
1459620 i hope to find in the moles dossier at least one piece that ive been missing
1459621 whatever is in the dossier will end up on the final quiz there could be anything in there of course ill never know
1459622 im a little disappointed that mark took the dossier instead of putting the money in the pot
1459623 but it was expected because its the moles job to keep money out of the pot
1459624 i am not at all confident about this last quiz
1459625 but im going to do everything in my power to try and win
1459626 im run down and i am weary but im still going to do it as best as i can and as fast as i can
1459627 to ensure myself a win i have to make sure that i pick the right person as the mole
1459628 i need to be as accurate as possible in a reasonable amount of time but if i have the wrong person selected it doesnt matter
1459629 we are excited to be broadening our aesthetic research and development pipeline and to be entering the international aesthetic market with the addition of the liposonix technology we continue to actively pursue business development opportunities looking at technologies with the potential to grow our clients businesses with enhanced patient offerings and build long term stockholder value as we look to the second half of 2008 we remain focused on furthering the development of products currently in our pipeline and readying for a first quarter introduction of reloxin r pending fda approval

1459640 we have a firm belief that the most efficient value proposition for creating a safe and secure supply chain is the incorporation of both product quality and the actual product authentication at this very critical time the pharmaceutical supply chain is re evaluating its collective options regarding pedigree rules and counterfeiting as they relate to brand protection

1459653 the disposition of 211 east ontario is another example of younan properties consistent performance where we continue to exceed expectations regardless of market conditions

1459660 so its important to choose a vehicle that will protect you in all kinds of crashes
1459661 there was a moment that i caught my husbands eye and he was just beaming from ear to ear and the boys were smiling
1459662 we do some sign language with them so they were sending me the i love you sign i just was so proud i knew at that second it wasnt just me that was winning it was my kids too and my family and everybody that voted for me it was just such a special moment
1459663 i think because ive been knocked down so many times there was still that part of me that was holding on that didnt want to have to go through a level of disappointment i wanted to try to set myself up for that
1459664 its so hard when youre invested heart and soul 100 into something and you believe it
1459665 when i had gone to austin and auditioned initially and i had made the top 200 and when they gave me the call that i made the top 50 and i was going to nashville week i just had this very overwhelming sensation of winning the competition
1459666 so i told my husband im going to tell you this because if i dont tell you this and i do win im going to be mad i didnt tell you this for some reason i think im going to win this competition its just my gut i left it at that and i went on
1459667 in the end it was one of those things i really appreciated
1459668 it just helps you not take any single moment for granted it helped me to really enjoy and take in every moment from then on because you just didnt know if you were going to go home or not
1459669 i really knew in my heart of hearts it was going to come down to me and gabe
1459670 i think gabes done a great job they said last night about him being so consistent and he is hes a very consistent singer he shows up every week and gives a good performance every week im proud of him
1459671 gabe is literally the most laid back mild mannered man ive ever met in my life hes so calm and cool and collective ive so enjoyed meeting him because i think its his personality that shines through his singing
1459672 shawn has grown leaps and bounds in this process im so proud of her
1459673 even though shes 21 and shes probably more like a younger sister age wise shes really like one of my children i love that she takes everything in and that shes tried to turn it around for the better most importantly i just want her to stay confident thats a challenge for her shes really really hard on herself
1459674 if i didnt have those things i may not have gotten on the show
1459675 im grateful that the things in my life have brought me to have a back story thats overall what makes an person interesting where they come from and the way they live their life so thats a good thing
1459676 thats going to be a pretty surreal moment for me
1459677 but at one time in my life my husband said to me what would it take for you to feel like you have finally made it at that time i said i think it would be cool to be driving down the road and hear my song on the radio knowing that it is literally playing on over 100 stations across the country is a very overwhelming feeling
1459678 its kind of crazy the opportunity to sing in front of what is potentially 100 million people i feel so amazingly blessed
1459679 i think its going to be a great journey and im really excited about going over and seeing a little bit of their culture
1459680 of course john had always been very gracious to me but there was something that changed in my mind to where i was like this is about me getting better as an artist and this is about john who is an artist mentoring me and telling me how i can be a better person in this industry
1459681 i told john thank you for complimenting me but i need you to tell me what i need to work on he did i really took that to heart that kind of changed the dynamic
1459682 john and i are also going to do a lot of writing together
1459683 i want to be able to sing music that comes from my heart and obviously i have a lot of fans out there that voted for me and like me for a reason i want to make sure that continues to come across in the album when we release it
1459684 i have a huge advantage over the previous five seasons in that i had nbc this year i found out this morning that there were over 5 million people that voted on the finale winner
1459685 thats an amazing amount of people that are supporting this show and hopefully going to continue to support the single as it comes out and all the music that ive got in the future i think most importantly im just going to stay who i am
1459686 with reality tv theres always an aspect of not reality i feel very fortunate in that nbc really did portray me in who i am im just a mom thats working hard that had a dream that dream just came true last night
1459687 im a pretty grounded person and i always want to stay that way i know where i came from and ill never forget
1459688 theres going to have to be a lot of changes
1459689 theres no question in my mind about that we do have our house on the market we have had for a few months now we will make a move to nashville because i think its imperative that takes place in order for me to focus on the music side and still give the kids the time they need from me as a mom
1459690 im going to have to have them here with me when i am on the road im going to make sure every opportunity that i have that they can be a part of what im doing
1459691 theres no doubt about it that it will be a challenge
1459692 but i think all in all life is full of challenges its full of obstacles but its our job to just go over those hurdles and keep moving forward im definitely not going to be an absent parent im going to be right there with them i just may have to travel a lot more in the beginning but in the end its going to allow me more time to spend with them
1459693 everyone who is seriously interested in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe a spirit vastly superior to man and one in the face of which our modest powers must feel humble
1459694 its drivel its arguing that the only plausible cause is a god because theres no perfect alternative so instead of the intellectual honesty of admitting that not all things have a valid explanation for their existence god is assumed to be the cause never mind if theres any other corroboration of his existence and not some generic god that just began the universe but a specific religion associated deity creationist hogwash is what it is an apparent abuse of occams razor we dont always know the answers the end
1459695 einstein was a genius he didnt need intellectual honesty that is for ordinary people like you and me he was gifted and he simply understood the source of that gift something people who are not genius or intuitive or right brained wouldnt know a thing about
1459696 i know a lot of people have watched this show that maybe have never listened to country music before theyre seeing the two of you stand up here we have a mother of five and a hispanic american country singer as the final 2

1459708 humans evolved the capacity to eat meat so its justified
1459709 humans evolved the capacity to eat meat so its a necessary part of a healthy diet
1459710 it is just plain wrong to take another animals life unnecessarily it is bloody brutal and barbaric
1459711 taking the life of an animal isnt cruel because theyre worthless stupid and probably not even self aware
1459712 when animals are seen as automatons with no emotions it is easy to treat them as mere property with which humans can do as they please
1459713 people have assumed that intelligence is linked to the ability to suffer and that because animals have smaller brains they suffer less than humans that is a pathetic piece of logic sentient animals have the capacity to experience pleasure and are motivated to seek it you only have to watch how cows and lambs both seek and enjoy pleasure when they lie with their heads raised to the sun on a perfect english summers day just like humans
1459714 in plants all over the united states this happens on a daily basis
1459715 ive seen it happen and ive talked to other veterinarians they feel its out of control
1459716 eating meat is my personal choice and since i respect your desire not to eat animals i would appreciate your respecting my preference
1459717 the problem with this justification is that it assumes there is no victim no other it implies that the desires traditions culture or taste buds are superior to anything or anyone else and that because of this he or she is absolved from the harm eating meat causes
1459718 i know so far that at least twelve senators have signed but we are still circulating it we only need eleven because the total number in the committee is only twenty
1459719 we already have twelve yesterday and i dont know of any more they are able to gather that is only to authorize me to make the committee report and sponsor it tomorrow our problem is to get the two thirds vote
1459720 my hopes are high that we will be able to get the two thirds vote that would be around fifteen or sixteen we already had twelve yesterday and we might even be able get that vote at the committee level alone in effect that will be anti climactic if we get fifteen or sixteen
1459721 enter into an exchange of notes so that all constitutional provisions in our philippine constitution that conflict with jpepa will be deemed dominant or superior to the jpepa provisions
1459722 it is edging towards ratification and i hope that will convince them tomorrow because we will lose a lot in terms of economic benefits if we do not concur
1459723 we will be the odd man out since the constitutional provisions of which i am very adamant for the past year have already been accepted by japan i have no more problems with it as a constitutional law scholar
1459724 how can we reap benefits in such a context without bringing our entrepreneurs to the level of their indian counterparts
1459725 there were such sentiments reigning in indian politics 10 or 15 years ago these leaders also talked about a fortress of economy if you read indian papers and magazines published at that time you can notice it ten years back i also went to goa for a seminar along with late minister lalith athulathmudali with regard to the agricultural sector some experts questioned why india was not importing hand tractors from japan despite the low cost but the indian leaders stressed the need to cling to their products they believed in a fortress economy at that time

1459727 2006 marked the fourth straight year in which income gains at the top outpaced those among the rest of the population since 2002 the average inflation adjusted income of the top 1 percent of households has risen 42 percent whereas the average inflation adjusted income of the bottom 90 percent of households has risen about 4 7 percent as a result the share of the nations income flowing to the top 1 percent has increased sharply rising from 15 8 percent in 2002 to 20 0 percent in 2006 not since 1928 just before the great depression has the top 1 percent held such a large share of the nations income see figure 1 in 2000 at the peak of the 1990s boom the top 1 percent received 19 3 percent of total income in the nation
1459728 the federal government has borrowed 1 6 trillion from 2001 2008 to pay for the tax cuts consequence all americans will have to pay for this tax cut related debt reducing their after tax income one third of the benefits of the cuts go to the top 1 percent of households one fifth of the benefits of the revenue reductions went to the top 0 3 of households that earn more than 1 million per year consequence inequality in america is increasing with the top 1 grabbing more of the anemic growth and the benefits of the bush revenue reductions meanwhile the bottom is stagnating investment and economic growth have not equaled other growth periods consequence with anemic growth and other policies that favor the wealthy the vast majority have been hurt not helped by the tax cuts making the cuts permanent would cost 3 4 trillion just over the next decade including borrowing costs three times what is needed to close the social security funding gap
